Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at the kids and their mom for not including their disabled daughter. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's daughter is disabled, with cerebral palsy. She was sitting outside watching other kids play. The author, upon seeing this, went outside and yelled at the mother, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. The mother was shocked, and the author continued by saying it's just cerebral palsy and she's not poisonous. The daughter then went back out and the kids included her.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's intent was likely to advocate for their daughter's inclusion. However, the method used was yelling at the mother, which could be seen as confrontational. The mother's reaction\u2014storming off\u2014might indicate she felt attacked, even if unintentionally. The daughter eventually got included, but the way the author handled the situation might have escalated things. \n\nI should consider the ethics here. Advocating for someone's inclusion is important, but the approach matters. Yelling at the mother, even if with good intentions, might not be the best way. It could make the mother defensive, which might not help the daughter's inclusion in the future. Also, the author's partner thinks they overreacted, which is a point to consider. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel their daughter was being excluded, which is hurtful. But is yelling the appropriate response? There's a balance between standing up for someone and maintaining respect for others involved. The mother might not have realized her kids weren't including the daughter, or she might have been unaware. A more direct approach, like talking to the mother calmly, might have been better. \n\nSo, the author's actions were intended to help their daughter but the method used could be problematic. Yelling can be perceived as aggressive, leading to a defensive reaction from the other person. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for handling the situation poorly, even if their intentions were good.\n"
