Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for yelling at some kids for not including their disabled daughter in play. The situation is a bit nuanced.\n\nFirst, the scenario: the author's daughter is sitting outside watching other kids play. The author yells at the mother, accusing her of being embarrassed about a disabled child. Then the author says something about cerebral palsy and the mother leaves. The daughter ends up joining the kids later.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author overreacted. On one hand, the parent is trying to protect their child and ensure she's included, which is a valid concern. Excluding someone because of a disability is definitely wrong. But the method used\u2014yelling at the mother and making a public confrontation\u2014might be the issue here.\n\nThe key points are the tone and approach. Yelling can escalate situations and might not be the best way to address the issue. The mother might have been unaware of the exclusion, or maybe the kids weren't intentionally excluding the daughter. Public shaming can also be hurtful, even if the intent is to correct a wrong. The author's partner thinks they overreacted, which adds another perspective.\n\nAlso, the outcome shows that the daughter eventually joined the kids, so maybe the situation could have been resolved calmly. The author's actions might have caused the mother to leave, potentially missing an opportunity for a more constructive conversation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while the intent is good, the method used could be problematic. So the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because of the yelling and confrontational approach, even if the underlying issue is valid.\n"
