Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author's daughter who has cerebral palsy not being included in a game by other kids. The author then yells at the mother, asking if she's embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid and mentions that the daughter isn't poisonous. The kids later included the daughter, but the mother didn't respond.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter was sitting and watching the kids play, which the author might have interpreted as exclusion. As a parent, wanting their child included is natural, but the method used here was yelling at another parent. Yelling can come off as aggressive, even if the intent is to advocate for their child. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as confrontational. Publicly shaming the mother, even if the intention was to promote inclusion, might not be the best approach. The mother might have had other reasons for the kids not including the daughter\u2014maybe the kids were being careless, not intentionally excluding her. The author didn't approach the kids directly first but went straight to the mother, which might have escalated things. \n\nOn the other hand, advocating for a child's inclusion is important, especially in cases where the child might feel left out. The daughter did end up being included after the incident, so maybe the author's actions, while harsh, had a positive outcome. However, the method used is questionable. The question is whether yelling was the right approach. \n\nAlso, the partner thinks the author overreacted, which adds another perspective. The key issue here is whether the means justified the end. While the intention was good, the method was confrontational and could have embarrassed the mother, which might not help in fostering a positive environment for future inclusion. \n\nSo, considering both the intent and the method, the author might be in the wrong for using yelling as a response. It's possible that a calmer approach, like talking to the mother privately or encouraging the kids, could have resolved the situation without conflict. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but there are nuances here."
