Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids' mom is in the wrong. The scenario involves their disabled daughter being excluded from play. \n\nFirst, the parent sees their daughter sitting alone while other kids play. They confront the other mom, yelling about being embarrassed and then making a comment about cerebral palsy. The other mom leaves, and later the kids include the daughter.\n\nThe key points here: the parent's intention was to defend their child's inclusion, which is valid. However, the method used was yelling and making a confrontational comment. Yelling can escalate situations and might have been public shaming. The other mom was a witness, so involving her in the confrontation could have been hurtful. \n\nBut the parent's concern is about their child's social inclusion and potential bullying. However, the approach might have been more effective if they had addressed the kids directly or involved their partner first. Yelling at another parent in front of the kids might not set a good example and could make the other parent defensive, leading to her leaving without resolving the issue.\n\nAlso, the daughter did eventually get included, but maybe a calmer approach would have led to the same result without the confrontation. The partner thinks the parent overreacted, which adds another perspective. So, while the intent is understandable, the method used was perhaps not the best. So, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach was aggressive and might have caused more harm than good.\n"
