Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter was in the wrong. The scenario is that the daughter was sitting on the veranda watching other kids play, and the parent yelled at the mother, saying things like \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" and \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything.\" Then the kids eventually included the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The daughter has a disability, and the parent is advocating for her inclusion. That's understandable and important. However, the method used was yelling at the other mother, which is aggressive. The parent might have felt frustrated or that their child was being excluded, but yelling in public can be confrontational. \n\nThe other mother might have had reasons the parent didn't know\u2014maybe the kids were too young to include safely, or there were other dynamics. The parent's approach could have been more respectful. Yelling can escalate situations and might make the other parent defensive instead of receptive to including the child. \n\nThe daughter ended up being included later, so maybe the kids were open to it once approached. The father-in-law's partner (the one who yelled) might have overreacted in the moment, but the intent was to help their child. However, the means of addressing the situation could have been handled better. \n\nSo, while the parent's intention was good, the method of confronting the other mother in a public and loud manner is likely inconsiderate. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because yelling was an inappropriate approach, even if the concern was valid.\n"
