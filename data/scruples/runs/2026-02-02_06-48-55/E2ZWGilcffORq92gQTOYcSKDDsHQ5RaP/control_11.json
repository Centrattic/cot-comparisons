Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the parent yelling at other kids' mother for not including their disabled daughter in play.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The parent saw their daughter sitting on the veranda watching kids play. They went over and yelled at the mother, accusing her of being embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then said their daughter isn't poisonous and the mother stormed off. Later, the kids included the daughter. The partner thinks the parent overreacted.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? Well, from a child's perspective, sometimes kids might not realize how their actions affect others, especially regarding disabilities. The parent is trying to protect their daughter and advocate for her inclusion. But the method was yelling at the mother, which can be seen as aggressive or confrontational.\n\nHowever, the parent's intention was to address what they perceived as exclusion due to the daughter's disability. The mother's reaction (storming off) suggests it was taken as an insult. But the daughter ended up being included after the incident. \n\nOn one hand, yelling isn't the best way to handle it. It's possible the other mother didn't realize the daughter wanted to join, or maybe the kids just weren't aware. The parent could have approached it more calmly. But on the other hand, advocating for their child's inclusion is important. The parent might have felt their child was being excluded because of her disability, so their actions were to stand up for her.\n\nThe line between defending one's child and overreacting is thin. The parent's approach was confrontational, which might not have been necessary. However, given the context of disability, the parent's concern is valid. The correct answer might depend on cultural or social norms. In some views, the parent acted in their child's best interest despite the harsh method. In others, yelling was the mistake.\n\nBut the AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit typically looks at whether the action was justified. Since the parent was trying to include their child, but the method was yelling at the other mother, the answer might be that the parent is in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if their intention was good. However, others might see it as justified given the disability aspect.\n\nBut the mother didn't ask the daughter to join; the daughter was just there watching. The parent might have assumed exclusion without knowing the reason. Maybe the mother didn't realize the daughter wanted to play. The parent's accusation of embarrassment might have been unfair. So, the parent overreacted by assuming ill intent and yelling. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
