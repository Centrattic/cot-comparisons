Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for yelling at kids for not including their disabled daughter. The situation is that their daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, and the author yelled at the mother, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then the author made another comment about cerebral palsy and the mother left. The daughter eventually joined the kids after.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author's main issue is that their daughter was excluded, which is understandable. As a parent, wanting your child to be included is natural. However, the way they addressed the situation was through yelling at the mother. Yelling can be seen as aggressive, even if the intent is good. It might have come across as confrontational rather than trying to resolve the issue calmly.\n\nThe mother's reaction was to storm off, which could mean she felt attacked. Maybe she was unaware of the exclusion or didn't realize her kids weren't including the daughter. The author didn't approach her to talk about it first; instead, they yelled. That approach might have escalated the situation instead of solving it. The daughter did end up joining the kids later, so maybe the exclusion wasn't deliberate or ongoing once the daughter approached them again.\n\nAlso, the partner thinks the author overreacted. That's a point to consider. While the concern is valid, the method used might not have been the best approach. The author could have tried to involve their partner or talked to the mother more calmly to express their concern instead of yelling. Yelling can make people defensive and less likely to respond positively.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was trying to advocate for their disabled child, which is important. The daughter's inclusion is crucial, and the parent's frustration is understandable. But the manner in which it was handled is questionable. The author might not be in the wrong for caring about their child's inclusion, but the way they expressed it could have been handled better.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on balancing the intent to help their daughter with the method of confrontation. Since the question is whether they're in the wrong, the answer would be A (Yes) because yelling at the mother was an aggressive response, even if the underlying concern is valid. The parent should have addressed the situation in a more constructive way to avoid making the other parent defensive.\n"
