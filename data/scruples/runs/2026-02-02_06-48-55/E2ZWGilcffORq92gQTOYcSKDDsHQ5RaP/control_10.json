Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's daughter has cerebral palsy and was sitting outside watching other kids play. The author got upset because the kids and their mom didn't include her. They yelled at the mom, which led to the mom leaving. Then the daughter went back and the kids included her. The partner thinks the author overreacted.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about inclusion and the mom's reaction. The author felt their daughter was excluded, so they confronted the other mom. But yelling might not be the best approach. Even if the intention was to protect their daughter's feelings, using yelling and a confrontational tone could be seen as aggressive. The other mom might have felt attacked, which explains why she left.\n\nOn the other hand, advocating for inclusion is important. The author's concern is valid because children with disabilities often face exclusion. But the method used was confrontational. Maybe a better approach would be to talk to the other mom calmly to encourage inclusion without making her defensive. \n\nThe daughter ended up being included after the incident, so maybe the other kids were open to including her but the mom didn't act on it. The author's outburst might have made the situation more tense. \n\nI think the answer depends on balancing the right to inclusion with the approach taken. While the intention was good, the method was confrontational and could be seen as wrong. So, the author might be in the wrong because they yelled, which isn't productive. But the underlying issue of exclusion isn't their fault. However, the way they handled it was inappropriate. So the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong) because of the yelling, even if the concern was valid.\n"
