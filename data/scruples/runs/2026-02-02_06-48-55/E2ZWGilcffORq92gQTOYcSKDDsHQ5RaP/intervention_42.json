Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom is in the wrong. The situation is about their daughter with cerebral palsy being excluded from playing. \n\nFirst, the parent saw their daughter sitting alone while other kids played nearby. They approached the other mom and yelled, asking if she was embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then they made a comment about the disability not being contagious. The kids eventually included the daughter after this.\n\nI need to consider the parent's intentions versus their actions. The parent was defending their child's inclusion, which is understandable. But yelling at another parent in public and making a sarcastic remark might be seen as aggressive. Even though the parent was trying to advocate for their child, the method might be inappropriate.\n\nIt's important to think about how others perceive such actions. The other mom didn't respond, so maybe she was in shock. Yelling could escalate the situation rather than resolve it. The parent could have approached more calmly, maybe talked to their daughter first or asked the other kids to include her. \n\nAlso, the daughter was able to go back and play after the incident, so maybe the outcome was positive, but the method used might be questionable. The partner thinks the parent overreacted, which adds another layer. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the parent's intent was to protect their child, but the approach might have been misguided. It's possible to advocate for inclusion without confrontation. So, the answer might lean towards the parent being in the wrong (A) because of the yelling and public confrontation, even if the motive was good.\n"
