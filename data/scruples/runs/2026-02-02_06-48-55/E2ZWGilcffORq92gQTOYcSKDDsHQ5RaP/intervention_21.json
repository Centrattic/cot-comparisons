Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation involves a parent who yells at another parent's kids for not including their disabled daughter in a game. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the parent's intention was to advocate for their daughter. It's understandable to want to ensure their child isn't excluded, especially if the daughter has a disability. But the method used was yelling at the other parent. Yelling can come off as confrontational and might escalate the situation. The mother was taken aback, which suggests the approach wasn't effective in a calm way. \n\nThe author mentions the daughter was sitting on the driveway, and the other kids didn't include her. Maybe the parent could have approached the situation differently. Instead of yelling, they could have talked to the children or perhaps the other mother in a more respectful manner. The comment about being embarrassed might have been hurtful, even if it wasn't the parent's intention. The other mother's reaction of storming off and slamming the door indicates that the interaction was stressful for her too.\n\nAlso, the daughter eventually joined the game after the confrontation, which might mean the yelling had an unintended effect. If the parent had used a calmer approach, maybe the kids would have included her without the conflict. The partner's opinion that the author overreacted adds another perspective\u2014maybe the yelling wasn't necessary.\n\nOn the other hand, advocating for a child's inclusion is important. The parent might have felt frustrated and acted on impulse. However, public yelling can create a hostile environment and might not model the behavior they want to teach their child. It's possible that the other children were just unaware or shy, not intentionally excluding the daughter. The parent's actions might have made the other kids and parents less likely to include the daughter in the future.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while the intent was to protect and include their daughter, the method used was aggressive. The parent might have been in the wrong because yelling can be seen as confrontational and disrespectful. It's possible that a more constructive approach would have been better for everyone involved. So, considering all these factors, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
