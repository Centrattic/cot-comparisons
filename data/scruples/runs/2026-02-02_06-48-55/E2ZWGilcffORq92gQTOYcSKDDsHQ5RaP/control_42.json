Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who yelled at the kids' mom was wrong. The scenario involves a disabled daughter being excluded from play by other kids.\n\nFirst, the person's intent was to advocate for their daughter. They noticed the kids weren't including her and felt it was a problem. The kids' mom was present, so maybe she didn't intervene. The author yelled at the mom, which could be seen as confrontational.\n\nBut why did they yell? The daughter has cerebral palsy, and the author might have felt that the exclusion was due to her disability. The mother's reaction was shock, and the kids eventually included the daughter after she went back out. The partner thinks it was an overreaction.\n\nIs yelling the right approach? Confrontation in public like that might have been harsh, but the motive was to protect their child. The alternative could have been to talk to the mother calmly later, but the situation was in real-time. The mother didn't respond, so maybe the author felt urgency.\n\nAlso, the daughter's inclusion was eventually achieved, so maybe the yelling had a positive outcome. But the method was confrontational. However, the author wasn't wrong in wanting their child to be included. Social exclusion can hurt, especially for children with disabilities. The mother's inaction might have contributed to the problem.\n\nSo, while the approach was aggressive, the intent was protective and corrective. The answer might be B (not wrong) because the action was in defense of their daughter's inclusion, even if the method was questionable. But some might argue A (wrong) because yelling is unproductive and could have escalated the situation. However, the core issue is about defending a child's right to be included, which justifies the action despite the method. So leaning towards B.\n"
