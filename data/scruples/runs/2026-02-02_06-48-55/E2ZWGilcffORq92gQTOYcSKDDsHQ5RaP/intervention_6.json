Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (on behalf of their partner) yelled at some kids and their mom for not including their disabled daughter in play. The daughter was sitting nearby watching, and when the author noticed the exclusion, they yelled out to the mother, making the situation awkward.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has cerebral palsy, so inclusion is a big deal. The author's intention was to advocate for their child's inclusion, which is understandable. However, the method used was yelling at the mother, which might have been confrontational. The mother's reaction was to leave, and the author's partner thinks they overreacted.\n\nThe key points here are the approach taken and the potential impact on the situation. While the intent was good, yelling can escalate tensions and might not be the best way to address the issue. The mother might have felt attacked, leading her to retreat. It's possible that a more calm and direct approach could have encouraged inclusion without making the mother defensive. Also, the daughter ended up being included later, which might suggest that the situation could have been resolved without confrontation. So, even though the motivation was to protect their child, the method could be seen as inappropriate, making the author at least partially at fault. So answer A.\n"
