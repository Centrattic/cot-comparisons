Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter was in the wrong. The situation is that the author's daughter was sitting outside watching other kids play, and when the author saw this, they yelled at the mother. The kids later included the daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has a disability, so inclusion is important. The author's intent was to defend their daughter's right to be included. But yelling is a strong reaction. Was there a better way to handle it?\n\nThe mother didn't respond, which might indicate she felt shamed. Yelling in public can be confrontational. Maybe the author could have approached the mother privately to discuss inclusion instead of confronting her in front of others. However, the author felt their daughter was being excluded, which is a valid concern. The key points are intent vs. method. The intent was protective, but the method was aggressive. The partner thinks it was overreacting. The daughter did get included later, but the interaction caused tension. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action was justified. While defending inclusion is right, the method of confrontation might be seen as the issue. So maybe the author is not in the wrong for wanting inclusion but could have handled it better. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since they acted out of concern for their child, but the method was yelling, which could be seen as inappropriate. So possibly answer A, but maybe B. Wait, sometimes these questions consider the intent. The answer might depend on cultural norms. In some views, defending your child is justified. But yelling might be seen as wrong. So maybe AITA would say the author is not in the wrong because they were advocating for their child's inclusion, even if the method was harsh. Alternatively, others might say they overreacted. I need to decide. The final answer is likely B (not in the wrong), but I'm not sure. Let me check again. The author's action led to the kids including the daughter. The mother left in embarrassment. The partner thinks they overreacted. The community might split, but the main issue is the justification for the action. Since the daughter was excluded, the author's intent was to correct that, so maybe B is correct. However, the way they handled it was yelling, which is aggressive. So maybe AITA thinks the author is in the wrong (A) because they used yelling instead of a calmer approach. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. The answer might be B, but I'm not 100% sure. Let me think again. The author's action was to ensure their daughter was included, which is right. The problem is the method. If the method was yelling, which is unproductive, but the intent was good. In AITA, usually, if the person's action was to protect their child, even if the method was harsh, they might not be in the wrong. So B. The answer is B.\n"
