Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story did something wrong by yelling at other kids' mom for not including their disabled daughter.\n\nFirst, the situation: the writer's daughter is sitting outside watching other kids play, but they aren't including her. The writer yells at the mother, asking if she's embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid. Then the writer says it's just cerebral palsy, not that she's poisonous. The kids later include the daughter, but the mom didn't respond and left. Partner thinks they overreacted.\n\nSo the question is whether the writer was wrong. The user thinks they are in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the writer is trying to advocate for their daughter, who might feel excluded. It's important to include children with disabilities in play. But the method used was yelling at the mother, which might not be the best approach. Maybe a more constructive approach would be better, like talking to the mom calmly or explaining to the kids to include the daughter. Yelling could be seen as confrontational and might make the other parent defensive, which might not lead to a positive outcome. \n\nBut the writer's intent was to protect their daughter from exclusion. However, the way they handled it, especially yelling and making an accusation of embarrassment, might not be the healthiest way. The mother might have had reasons we don't know about\u2014maybe the kids were playing a game that wasn't inclusive, or she was trying to manage them. The writer's approach could have caused more harm by making the mom defensive instead of addressing the issue of inclusion.\n\nAlso, the daughter eventually got included, but the mom left upset. It's possible the writer's outburst made the mom feel attacked, which is not helpful for future interactions. The partner's reaction suggests that maybe the writer overreacted. So even though the intention was good, the method might be wrong. So the answer would be A, the writer is in the wrong because they used an aggressive approach instead of a more constructive one.\n"
