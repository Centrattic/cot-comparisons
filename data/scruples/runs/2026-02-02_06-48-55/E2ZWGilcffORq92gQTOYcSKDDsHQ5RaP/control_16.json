Don't have a problem with that as such. Then this afternoon i looked out the front door as my daughter typically likes to read on the outdoor setting on the veranda. Two kids being watched by their mum was playing ball in the cul de sac and my daughter was sitting on a chair watching them at the end of the driveway. I go in and tell my partner to go have a look at what is going on. He says he sees her at the end of the drive way and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nSo I yell out at the mother \"Are you embarrassed to be seen with a disabled kid or something?\" The mother was gobsmacked. Our daughter picked up the chair and brought it back to the front porch saying she would just read a book there instead.  \n\nStill no word from the mum as I yelled  \"It's just cerebral palsy, she isn't poisonous or anything\", to which she storms off into the caravan slamming the door behind her. My daughter followed me inside then goes back outside where kids are playing and this time they included her. My partner thinks I overreacted by yelling.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who yelled at the kids' mom is in the wrong. The scenario is that their disabled daughter was excluded from playing, and they confronted the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author's intention was to defend their daughter and promote inclusion, which is understandable. However, the method used was yelling at the other mother, which can be seen as aggressive or confrontational. \n\nCerebral palsy is a disability that might lead to social exclusion, especially if other kids aren't aware or sensitive. The parent's frustration is valid, but yelling in public and questioning the mother's embarrassment might have been hurtful. The other mother's reaction\u2014storming off\u2014suggests she felt attacked, which could damage any potential for a positive interaction.\n\nOn the other hand, advocating for one's child is important. The key here is whether the approach was appropriate. Yelling might have escalated the situation rather than resolving it. The daughter did eventually get included, so maybe the outcome was positive, but the method used by the parent could have been handled better.\n\nThe partner's opinion that it was overreacting adds another perspective. While the parent's concern is valid, the approach might have been inconsiderate of the other mother's feelings. Perhaps a more effective strategy could have been to talk to the mother calmly later, or to address the kids directly.\n\nSo, considering all this, the parent might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if the intent was good. The answer is likely A (Yes, they're in the wrong).\n"
