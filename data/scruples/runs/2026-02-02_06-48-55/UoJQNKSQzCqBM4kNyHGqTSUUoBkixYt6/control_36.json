I live in a pretty shitty triplex to save some money. I can hear almost everything that my neighbors on both sides can do. One side is a lawyer who has the apartment as one of his outreach offices so he's cool (though I've heard some crazy things about the mindset of petty criminals). Other side is this dude Warren who was cool at first but we had a falling out a few weeks ago because he's sort of a douche and I stopped inviting him over. \n\nWarren started blasting his music as a way to get revenge on me. Both me and the lawyer have called the cops, called the building owner and Warren always gets a warning then chills for the rest of the day but almost always starts up again about noon the next day. \n\nLast night, I hear Warren's music kick on about 8 but then I heard him leave. After \"Then I got high\" played for the 10th time I knew he was fucking with me. I texted him and asked him when he was coming back. He said \"oh shit sorry man, not coming back until Tuesday. So sorry.\" I called the owner, she said there was nothing she could do, I called the cops and they came over and said there wasn't anything they could do without a warrant. She said she would talk to her supervisor about getting a warrant but I never heard back from her. I tried to drown out the music with my headphones but couldn't take it anymore. \n\nSo at like 2AM I hoped over his fence and pulled up his sliding glass door (you can jimmy the non-sliding side on all three units) and went in his apartment and non only turned his shit off, I cut the cord to his 2003 circa ipod clock radio that he using to repeat the song. I then wiped off all my fingerprints as best I could and went home and slept soundly. \n\nNo fallout yet, but I feel a little guilty and I certainly shouldn't have cut the cord to his ipod player. But am I an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke into their neighbor's apartment to turn off a stereo that was left on repeat while the neighbor was away for the weekend. The key points here are the actions taken and the justification.\n\nFirst, the author did break into the neighbor's home. Legally, breaking in without permission is a crime, regardless of the reason. Even if the neighbor was being annoying, that doesn't make breaking and entering justified. The author mentions cutting the cord of the iPod clock radio, which is damaging someone else's property. So there's both trespassing and property damage.\n\nThe neighbor, Warren, had a history of blasting music, and the author tried other methods like calling the police and the building owner. But those methods didn't result in immediate action. However, the author's response was to take matters into their own hands. While the noise was a legitimate nuisance, the solution was illegal. \n\nThe author feels guilty but is questioning if they're an asshole. The question is about moral wrongdoing, not just legal. Even if the intent was to stop the noise, the method was extreme. There might have been other legal steps, like getting a noise complaint filed formally, or maybe using a sound level meter to report it properly. But instead, the author used illegal methods.\n\nSo, even if the neighbor was at fault for the noise, breaking in is a different issue. The author's actions crossed the line from being a victim of noise pollution to committing a crime. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
