I live in a pretty shitty triplex to save some money. I can hear almost everything that my neighbors on both sides can do. One side is a lawyer who has the apartment as one of his outreach offices so he's cool (though I've heard some crazy things about the mindset of petty criminals). Other side is this dude Warren who was cool at first but we had a falling out a few weeks ago because he's sort of a douche and I stopped inviting him over. \n\nWarren started blasting his music as a way to get revenge on me. Both me and the lawyer have called the cops, called the building owner and Warren always gets a warning then chills for the rest of the day but almost always starts up again about noon the next day. \n\nLast night, I hear Warren's music kick on about 8 but then I heard him leave. After \"Then I got high\" played for the 10th time I knew he was fucking with me. I texted him and asked him when he was coming back. He said \"oh shit sorry man, not coming back until Tuesday. So sorry.\" I called the owner, she said there was nothing she could do, I called the cops and they came over and said there wasn't anything they could do without a warrant. She said she would talk to her supervisor about getting a warrant but I never heard back from her. I tried to drown out the music with my headphones but couldn't take it anymore. \n\nSo at like 2AM I hoped over his fence and pulled up his sliding glass door (you can jimmy the non-sliding side on all three units) and went in his apartment and non only turned his shit off, I cut the cord to his 2003 circa ipod clock radio that he using to repeat the song. I then wiped off all my fingerprints as best I could and went home and slept soundly. \n\nNo fallout yet, but I feel a little guilty and I certainly shouldn't have cut the cord to his ipod player. But am I an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about breaking into a neighbor's apartment to turn off their stereo that was left on repeat. The author did this because the neighbor was using loud music as revenge, and previous attempts to get help (calling cops, owner) didn't work. The author then broke into the apartment, turned off the music, cut the cord of the iPod, and wiped fingerprints.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Breaking into someone's property without permission is illegal, regardless of the reason. Even if the motivation was to stop noise, it's still a criminal offense. The author acknowledges that they broke the law, so there's no denying the legal wrongdoing.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The neighbor had a history of being a problem, but the author's response was to take matters into their own hands. Instead of finding alternative solutions like using noise-canceling headphones, leaving the area, or maybe installing some kind of soundproofing, they chose to break in. That escalates the situation and could lead to more conflict.\n\nThe author did feel guilty afterward, which shows some remorse. They also mention that cutting the cord was a bad move, even if turning off the stereo wasn't. But the act of breaking in itself is a major issue. Even if the intent was to help, the method was wrong.\n\nPossible defenses could be the neighbor's prior behavior and the lack of response from authorities. However, that doesn't justify illegal actions. The author should have maybe considered other legal avenues, like a noise complaint through the proper channels, or seeking a restraining order if the harassment continued. They might have also considered documenting all incidents to present to the landlord or authorities.\n\nIn terms of the neighbor's fault, Warren did leave the music on and had a history of getting into trouble for it. But the author's response is not the appropriate way to handle it. The answer hinges on whether taking the law into one's own hands is justified. Generally, no, because it leads to more problems and potential legal consequences for the author.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
