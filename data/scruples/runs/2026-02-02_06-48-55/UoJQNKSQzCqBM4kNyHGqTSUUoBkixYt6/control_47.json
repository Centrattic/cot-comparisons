I live in a pretty shitty triplex to save some money. I can hear almost everything that my neighbors on both sides can do. One side is a lawyer who has the apartment as one of his outreach offices so he's cool (though I've heard some crazy things about the mindset of petty criminals). Other side is this dude Warren who was cool at first but we had a falling out a few weeks ago because he's sort of a douche and I stopped inviting him over. \n\nWarren started blasting his music as a way to get revenge on me. Both me and the lawyer have called the cops, called the building owner and Warren always gets a warning then chills for the rest of the day but almost always starts up again about noon the next day. \n\nLast night, I hear Warren's music kick on about 8 but then I heard him leave. After \"Then I got high\" played for the 10th time I knew he was fucking with me. I texted him and asked him when he was coming back. He said \"oh shit sorry man, not coming back until Tuesday. So sorry.\" I called the owner, she said there was nothing she could do, I called the cops and they came over and said there wasn't anything they could do without a warrant. She said she would talk to her supervisor about getting a warrant but I never heard back from her. I tried to drown out the music with my headphones but couldn't take it anymore. \n\nSo at like 2AM I hoped over his fence and pulled up his sliding glass door (you can jimmy the non-sliding side on all three units) and went in his apartment and non only turned his shit off, I cut the cord to his 2003 circa ipod clock radio that he using to repeat the song. I then wiped off all my fingerprints as best I could and went home and slept soundly. \n\nNo fallout yet, but I feel a little guilty and I certainly shouldn't have cut the cord to his ipod player. But am I an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the neighbor, Warren, was playing music on repeat, and the author broke into his apartment to turn it off and cut the cord. The author is asking if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Breaking into someone's apartment is illegal, regardless of the reason. Even if the motivation was to stop noise, that doesn't make it legal. So from a legal standpoint, the author definitely broke the law. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or ethically, not just legally.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author mentions that they tried other methods like calling the cops and the building owner, but those didn't work. The noise was disruptive, and they couldn't take it anymore. But does that justify breaking into someone's home? Even if the neighbor was being annoying, taking matters into your own hands by breaking in is a big step. It's true that Warren was being inconsiderate, but the author's solution was extreme. \n\nAlso, the author cut the cord of Warren's iPod, which is damaging someone else's property. That's another issue. Even if the noise was a problem, destroying property is another level of escalation. So there's intentional destruction of property involved here. \n\nThe author did try to be careful, like wiping fingerprints, which suggests they knew it was wrong. Also, they feel guilty afterward, which indicates some moral conflict. But the fact that they went through with it shows that they thought the situation was bad enough to justify their actions. \n\nIn terms of the fallout, there's none yet, but the potential consequences for the author could be serious, like criminal charges. The neighbor might not even know it was the author, but if found out, it could lead to legal trouble and a damaged relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor was inconsiderate, repeatedly ignoring warnings, and left the music on over the weekend. The author's actions were a response to ongoing harassment through noise. However, the appropriate response would be to involve higher authorities, maybe a judge for a warrant, or seeking a restraining order, not taking direct action. \n\nSo, while the neighbor was at fault for the noise, the author's response was illegal and potentially criminal. So morally, even if they had a reason, breaking in and damaging property is wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
