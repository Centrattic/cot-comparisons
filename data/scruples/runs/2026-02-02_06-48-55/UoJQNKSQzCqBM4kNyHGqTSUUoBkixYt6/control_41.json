I live in a pretty shitty triplex to save some money. I can hear almost everything that my neighbors on both sides can do. One side is a lawyer who has the apartment as one of his outreach offices so he's cool (though I've heard some crazy things about the mindset of petty criminals). Other side is this dude Warren who was cool at first but we had a falling out a few weeks ago because he's sort of a douche and I stopped inviting him over. \n\nWarren started blasting his music as a way to get revenge on me. Both me and the lawyer have called the cops, called the building owner and Warren always gets a warning then chills for the rest of the day but almost always starts up again about noon the next day. \n\nLast night, I hear Warren's music kick on about 8 but then I heard him leave. After \"Then I got high\" played for the 10th time I knew he was fucking with me. I texted him and asked him when he was coming back. He said \"oh shit sorry man, not coming back until Tuesday. So sorry.\" I called the owner, she said there was nothing she could do, I called the cops and they came over and said there wasn't anything they could do without a warrant. She said she would talk to her supervisor about getting a warrant but I never heard back from her. I tried to drown out the music with my headphones but couldn't take it anymore. \n\nSo at like 2AM I hoped over his fence and pulled up his sliding glass door (you can jimmy the non-sliding side on all three units) and went in his apartment and non only turned his shit off, I cut the cord to his 2003 circa ipod clock radio that he using to repeat the song. I then wiped off all my fingerprints as best I could and went home and slept soundly. \n\nNo fallout yet, but I feel a little guilty and I certainly shouldn't have cut the cord to his ipod player. But am I an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking into their neighbor's apartment to turn off the stereo. The story says the neighbor, Warren, left his music on repeat for an entire weekend while he was away. The author tried contacting the police and the building owner, but they couldn't do anything without a warrant. Eventually, the author broke in, turned off the stereo, cut the cord, and tried to clean up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Breaking into someone's property is illegal regardless of the circumstances. Even if the motivation was to stop noise, it's a criminal act. The author admits they broke the law. So legally, they're definitely wrong.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The neighbor's actions were inconsiderate and possibly malicious, but does that justify breaking in? Maybe the author felt desperate because they couldn't get help from authorities. However, taking the law into one's own hands can lead to more harm. The author damaged property and could have been caught, leading to legal trouble for Warren too if the author was identified. \n\nAlso, the author mentions a prior falling out with Warren, which might have contributed to their decision. But even if there's a history, it doesn't excuse illegal actions. The right approach would have been to continue working through legal channels, maybe seeking a restraining order or noise complaint through proper procedures.\n\nThe author feels guilty, which suggests some moral conflict. However, guilt doesn't erase the wrongdoing. The fact that they used a throwaway to post shows they're aware of the severity of their actions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the neighbor's behavior was annoying and possibly intentional, the author's solution was unlawful and excessive. The correct answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
