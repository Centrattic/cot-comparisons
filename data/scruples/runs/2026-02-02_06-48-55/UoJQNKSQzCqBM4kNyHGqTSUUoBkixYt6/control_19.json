I live in a pretty shitty triplex to save some money. I can hear almost everything that my neighbors on both sides can do. One side is a lawyer who has the apartment as one of his outreach offices so he's cool (though I've heard some crazy things about the mindset of petty criminals). Other side is this dude Warren who was cool at first but we had a falling out a few weeks ago because he's sort of a douche and I stopped inviting him over. \n\nWarren started blasting his music as a way to get revenge on me. Both me and the lawyer have called the cops, called the building owner and Warren always gets a warning then chills for the rest of the day but almost always starts up again about noon the next day. \n\nLast night, I hear Warren's music kick on about 8 but then I heard him leave. After \"Then I got high\" played for the 10th time I knew he was fucking with me. I texted him and asked him when he was coming back. He said \"oh shit sorry man, not coming back until Tuesday. So sorry.\" I called the owner, she said there was nothing she could do, I called the cops and they came over and said there wasn't anything they could do without a warrant. She said she would talk to her supervisor about getting a warrant but I never heard back from her. I tried to drown out the music with my headphones but couldn't take it anymore. \n\nSo at like 2AM I hoped over his fence and pulled up his sliding glass door (you can jimmy the non-sliding side on all three units) and went in his apartment and non only turned his shit off, I cut the cord to his 2003 circa ipod clock radio that he using to repeat the song. I then wiped off all my fingerprints as best I could and went home and slept soundly. \n\nNo fallout yet, but I feel a little guilty and I certainly shouldn't have cut the cord to his ipod player. But am I an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking into their neighbor's apartment to turn off the stereo. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The neighbor, Warren, was blasting music repeatedly, causing disturbance. The author tried contacting the cops and the building owner, but they couldn't get it resolved. Eventually, the author broke in, turned off the stereo, and cut the cord of the iPod. \n\nNow, the main issue here is whether breaking into someone's home is justifiable. Legally, breaking into a property without permission is a crime, regardless of the reason. Even if the motivation is to stop noise pollution, the method used is illegal. The author admits they broke the law by cutting the cord and wiped fingerprints, which shows they were aware it was wrong.\n\nMoral standpoint: While the noise was a problem, the response was extreme. There are legal steps one can take, like getting a restraining order or involving the court system. Taking matters into one's own hands by breaking in is not acceptable. The author's actions could have been dangerous if Warren had been there. It also escalates the conflict instead of resolving it.\n\nThe author's actions caused property damage (cutting the cord) which is another legal issue. Even if Warren was being a nuisance, the author's response violates the law and ethical standards. \n\nSo, even though the author might have had a valid grievance, the method of resolution is clearly wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
