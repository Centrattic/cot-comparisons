I live in a pretty shitty triplex to save some money. I can hear almost everything that my neighbors on both sides can do. One side is a lawyer who has the apartment as one of his outreach offices so he's cool (though I've heard some crazy things about the mindset of petty criminals). Other side is this dude Warren who was cool at first but we had a falling out a few weeks ago because he's sort of a douche and I stopped inviting him over. \n\nWarren started blasting his music as a way to get revenge on me. Both me and the lawyer have called the cops, called the building owner and Warren always gets a warning then chills for the rest of the day but almost always starts up again about noon the next day. \n\nLast night, I hear Warren's music kick on about 8 but then I heard him leave. After \"Then I got high\" played for the 10th time I knew he was fucking with me. I texted him and asked him when he was coming back. He said \"oh shit sorry man, not coming back until Tuesday. So sorry.\" I called the owner, she said there was nothing she could do, I called the cops and they came over and said there wasn't anything they could do without a warrant. She said she would talk to her supervisor about getting a warrant but I never heard back from her. I tried to drown out the music with my headphones but couldn't take it anymore. \n\nSo at like 2AM I hoped over his fence and pulled up his sliding glass door (you can jimmy the non-sliding side on all three units) and went in his apartment and non only turned his shit off, I cut the cord to his 2003 circa ipod clock radio that he using to repeat the song. I then wiped off all my fingerprints as best I could and went home and slept soundly. \n\nNo fallout yet, but I feel a little guilty and I certainly shouldn't have cut the cord to his ipod player. But am I an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking into their neighbor's apartment to turn off the stereo. The situation is that the neighbor, Warren, was playing music on repeat, and even after being warned by cops and the building owner, he kept doing it. The author ended up breaking in, turning it off, and cutting the cord.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Breaking into someone's property is illegal, regardless of the reason. Even if the motivation is to stop noise, trespassing and damaging property are criminal offenses. The author admits they broke the law, so legally, they're definitely in the wrong. But the question is more about whether they're an asshole morally.\n\nMorally, the author had a problem with the noise and tried to resolve it through legal channels\u2014calling the police, the building owner. When those didn't work, they took matters into their own hands. But the solution involved illegal actions. While the intent was understandable (to stop the noise), the method was extreme. Cutting the cord is damaging someone's property, which is theft or vandalism. Even though the neighbor was being annoying, the author didn't have the right to do that.\n\nThere's also the aspect of proportionality. The noise was a nuisance, but breaking in and damaging property is a severe response. The author could have considered other non-invasive options, like using noise-canceling headphones more effectively, or maybe even moving if the noise was unbearable. Alternatively, maybe pursuing a noise complaint through the court system if the problem persisted.\n\nThe falling out between the author and Warren adds some context. The author might have had a personal vendetta, which could influence their judgment. However, that doesn't excuse the illegal actions. The neighbor might have been at fault for the noise, but that doesn't grant the author the right to retaliate in such a way.\n\nIn terms of community standards, most people would agree that while the neighbor's behavior was inconsiderate, breaking into their home is not an acceptable solution. The author's actions could have led to serious legal consequences for both parties, and it's a risky way to handle a conflict.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions were illegal and went beyond reasonable measures to address the noise issue. Even though their intent was to stop a nuisance, the method was wrong. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
