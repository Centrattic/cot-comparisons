I live in a pretty shitty triplex to save some money. I can hear almost everything that my neighbors on both sides can do. One side is a lawyer who has the apartment as one of his outreach offices so he's cool (though I've heard some crazy things about the mindset of petty criminals). Other side is this dude Warren who was cool at first but we had a falling out a few weeks ago because he's sort of a douche and I stopped inviting him over. \n\nWarren started blasting his music as a way to get revenge on me. Both me and the lawyer have called the cops, called the building owner and Warren always gets a warning then chills for the rest of the day but almost always starts up again about noon the next day. \n\nLast night, I hear Warren's music kick on about 8 but then I heard him leave. After \"Then I got high\" played for the 10th time I knew he was fucking with me. I texted him and asked him when he was coming back. He said \"oh shit sorry man, not coming back until Tuesday. So sorry.\" I called the owner, she said there was nothing she could do, I called the cops and they came over and said there wasn't anything they could do without a warrant. She said she would talk to her supervisor about getting a warrant but I never heard back from her. I tried to drown out the music with my headphones but couldn't take it anymore. \n\nSo at like 2AM I hoped over his fence and pulled up his sliding glass door (you can jimmy the non-sliding side on all three units) and went in his apartment and non only turned his shit off, I cut the cord to his 2003 circa ipod clock radio that he using to repeat the song. I then wiped off all my fingerprints as best I could and went home and slept soundly. \n\nNo fallout yet, but I feel a little guilty and I certainly shouldn't have cut the cord to his ipod player. But am I an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking into a neighbor's apartment to turn off his stereo. The situation is that the neighbor, Warren, was playing music on repeat that the author found annoying, and after multiple warnings from the cops and the building owner, the author took matters into their own hands. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Breaking into someone's apartment without permission is illegal, regardless of the reason. The author mentions they cut the cord of Warren's iPod clock radio and wiped their fingerprints. That's definitely vandalism and trespassing. Even if it was to stop noise, it's a criminal act.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author and Warren had a falling out, so maybe there's some personal tension. But that doesn't justify breaking in. The author tried the legal avenues\u2014calling the police and the building owner\u2014but when those didn't work, they resorted to illegal actions. That's a problem because everyone should be held to the same legal standards. The author can't take the law into their own hands, even if they were frustrated. \n\nAlso, the author's actions might have escalated the situation. Warren might now have damages to repair, and the author could face legal consequences if found out. The guilt the author feels is probably justified because they broke the law. While the motivation was to stop noise, which is a legitimate concern, the method was wrong. There might be other options, like getting a restraining order or using soundproofing, but breaking in is not acceptable. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author had a reason, their actions were illegal and unethical. The answer should be A.\n"
