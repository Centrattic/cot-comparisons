I live in a pretty shitty triplex to save some money. I can hear almost everything that my neighbors on both sides can do. One side is a lawyer who has the apartment as one of his outreach offices so he's cool (though I've heard some crazy things about the mindset of petty criminals). Other side is this dude Warren who was cool at first but we had a falling out a few weeks ago because he's sort of a douche and I stopped inviting him over. \n\nWarren started blasting his music as a way to get revenge on me. Both me and the lawyer have called the cops, called the building owner and Warren always gets a warning then chills for the rest of the day but almost always starts up again about noon the next day. \n\nLast night, I hear Warren's music kick on about 8 but then I heard him leave. After \"Then I got high\" played for the 10th time I knew he was fucking with me. I texted him and asked him when he was coming back. He said \"oh shit sorry man, not coming back until Tuesday. So sorry.\" I called the owner, she said there was nothing she could do, I called the cops and they came over and said there wasn't anything they could do without a warrant. She said she would talk to her supervisor about getting a warrant but I never heard back from her. I tried to drown out the music with my headphones but couldn't take it anymore. \n\nSo at like 2AM I hoped over his fence and pulled up his sliding glass door (you can jimmy the non-sliding side on all three units) and went in his apartment and non only turned his shit off, I cut the cord to his 2003 circa ipod clock radio that he using to repeat the song. I then wiped off all my fingerprints as best I could and went home and slept soundly. \n\nNo fallout yet, but I feel a little guilty and I certainly shouldn't have cut the cord to his ipod player. But am I an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for breaking into their neighbor's apartment to turn off a stereo that was left on repeat over the weekend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Breaking into someone's property is illegal, regardless of the reason. Even if the motivation was to stop noise, it's still a criminal act. So legally, the author is definitely in the wrong.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The neighbor had a history of playing loud music, and previous attempts to resolve it through legal channels (calling cops, the building owner) didn't work. The author tried to contact Warren but to no avail. The situation was causing significant distress, and the noise was continuous. However, taking matters into one's own hands by breaking in and damaging property is not an ethical solution. There are other non-legal methods one might consider, like using noise-cancelling headphones more effectively, or perhaps seeking mediation through a community board or a tenant's union. But the author's choice to break in and destroy property crosses a line.\n\nThe author mentions feeling guilty, which indicates they recognize the wrongdoing. The act of breaking in and damaging property is a clear violation of the neighbor's rights and could lead to criminal charges. Even if the intention was good (to stop the noise), the method was extreme and illegal.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). The action was illegal and unethical, despite the provocation.\n"
