I live in a pretty shitty triplex to save some money. I can hear almost everything that my neighbors on both sides can do. One side is a lawyer who has the apartment as one of his outreach offices so he's cool (though I've heard some crazy things about the mindset of petty criminals). Other side is this dude Warren who was cool at first but we had a falling out a few weeks ago because he's sort of a douche and I stopped inviting him over. \n\nWarren started blasting his music as a way to get revenge on me. Both me and the lawyer have called the cops, called the building owner and Warren always gets a warning then chills for the rest of the day but almost always starts up again about noon the next day. \n\nLast night, I hear Warren's music kick on about 8 but then I heard him leave. After \"Then I got high\" played for the 10th time I knew he was fucking with me. I texted him and asked him when he was coming back. He said \"oh shit sorry man, not coming back until Tuesday. So sorry.\" I called the owner, she said there was nothing she could do, I called the cops and they came over and said there wasn't anything they could do without a warrant. She said she would talk to her supervisor about getting a warrant but I never heard back from her. I tried to drown out the music with my headphones but couldn't take it anymore. \n\nSo at like 2AM I hoped over his fence and pulled up his sliding glass door (you can jimmy the non-sliding side on all three units) and went in his apartment and non only turned his shit off, I cut the cord to his 2003 circa ipod clock radio that he using to repeat the song. I then wiped off all my fingerprints as best I could and went home and slept soundly. \n\nNo fallout yet, but I feel a little guilty and I certainly shouldn't have cut the cord to his ipod player. But am I an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking into a neighbor's apartment to turn off a stereo that was left on repeat over the weekend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Breaking into someone's property without permission is illegal, regardless of the reason. The author admits they broke the law by entering the neighbor's apartment. Even though the motivation was to stop noise, that doesn't make the action legal. So legally, the author is definitely in the wrong.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The neighbor, Warren, was playing music repeatedly, which annoyed the author. The author tried calling the police and the building owner, but didn't get help. However, taking matters into one's own hands by breaking in and damaging property is not the right approach. It's understandable that the noise was frustrating, but the solution involved criminal behavior. The author could have considered other options, like installing soundproofing, moving, or documenting the noise for future legal action.\n\nThe author also mentions cutting the cord of the iPod clock radio. Damaging someone's property is a criminal offense and adds to the wrongdoing. Even if the intent was to stop the noise, destroying property is not justified.\n\nThe guilt the author feels suggests they recognize the impropriety of their actions. The question is whether they are an asshole. The story presents the neighbor as problematic, but the author's actions cross a legal and ethical line. While the noise was a valid issue, the response was excessive and illegal.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the motivation was understandable, the actions taken were illegal and unethical. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
