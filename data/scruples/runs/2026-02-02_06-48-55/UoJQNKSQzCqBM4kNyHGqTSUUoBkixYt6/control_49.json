I live in a pretty shitty triplex to save some money. I can hear almost everything that my neighbors on both sides can do. One side is a lawyer who has the apartment as one of his outreach offices so he's cool (though I've heard some crazy things about the mindset of petty criminals). Other side is this dude Warren who was cool at first but we had a falling out a few weeks ago because he's sort of a douche and I stopped inviting him over. \n\nWarren started blasting his music as a way to get revenge on me. Both me and the lawyer have called the cops, called the building owner and Warren always gets a warning then chills for the rest of the day but almost always starts up again about noon the next day. \n\nLast night, I hear Warren's music kick on about 8 but then I heard him leave. After \"Then I got high\" played for the 10th time I knew he was fucking with me. I texted him and asked him when he was coming back. He said \"oh shit sorry man, not coming back until Tuesday. So sorry.\" I called the owner, she said there was nothing she could do, I called the cops and they came over and said there wasn't anything they could do without a warrant. She said she would talk to her supervisor about getting a warrant but I never heard back from her. I tried to drown out the music with my headphones but couldn't take it anymore. \n\nSo at like 2AM I hoped over his fence and pulled up his sliding glass door (you can jimmy the non-sliding side on all three units) and went in his apartment and non only turned his shit off, I cut the cord to his 2003 circa ipod clock radio that he using to repeat the song. I then wiped off all my fingerprints as best I could and went home and slept soundly. \n\nNo fallout yet, but I feel a little guilty and I certainly shouldn't have cut the cord to his ipod player. But am I an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke into their neighbor's apartment to turn off a stereo that was left on repeat over the weekend when the neighbor was away. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Breaking into someone's property without permission is illegal, regardless of the reason. Even if the neighbor was being noisy, the author shouldn't have taken matters into their own hands. The police and building owner were contacted, but they couldn't do anything without a warrant. The author's actions definitely constitute trespassing and possibly property damage (cutting the cord). So legally, they're definitely in the wrong.\n\nNext, the moral aspect. The neighbor was being inconsiderate with the noise, but that doesn't justify breaking in. The author had tried contacting authorities but when those didn't work, they took it upon themselves. However, there are other possible solutions they could have explored, like maybe using noise-cancelling methods more effectively, or trying to negotiate with the neighbor again. Cutting the cord and breaking in is a drastic and illegal measure. Even if the intention was good (to stop the noise), the method was extreme.\n\nThe author also mentions feeling guilty, which shows they recognize something's wrong. But guilt doesn't change the fact that their actions were illegal. The fact that there's no fallout yet might be because the neighbor hasn't noticed, but if found out, it could lead to serious consequences for the author.\n\nSo, combining legal and moral considerations, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
