I live in a pretty shitty triplex to save some money. I can hear almost everything that my neighbors on both sides can do. One side is a lawyer who has the apartment as one of his outreach offices so he's cool (though I've heard some crazy things about the mindset of petty criminals). Other side is this dude Warren who was cool at first but we had a falling out a few weeks ago because he's sort of a douche and I stopped inviting him over. \n\nWarren started blasting his music as a way to get revenge on me. Both me and the lawyer have called the cops, called the building owner and Warren always gets a warning then chills for the rest of the day but almost always starts up again about noon the next day. \n\nLast night, I hear Warren's music kick on about 8 but then I heard him leave. After \"Then I got high\" played for the 10th time I knew he was fucking with me. I texted him and asked him when he was coming back. He said \"oh shit sorry man, not coming back until Tuesday. So sorry.\" I called the owner, she said there was nothing she could do, I called the cops and they came over and said there wasn't anything they could do without a warrant. She said she would talk to her supervisor about getting a warrant but I never heard back from her. I tried to drown out the music with my headphones but couldn't take it anymore. \n\nSo at like 2AM I hoped over his fence and pulled up his sliding glass door (you can jimmy the non-sliding side on all three units) and went in his apartment and non only turned his shit off, I cut the cord to his 2003 circa ipod clock radio that he using to repeat the song. I then wiped off all my fingerprints as best I could and went home and slept soundly. \n\nNo fallout yet, but I feel a little guilty and I certainly shouldn't have cut the cord to his ipod player. But am I an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking into their neighbor's apartment to turn off the stereo. So first, I need to consider the legal aspects. Breaking into someone's home is illegal regardless of the reason, right? Even if it's a justified annoyance, the act itself is a crime. The author admits they broke the law by cutting the cord and wiping fingerprints, which shows they knew it was wrong.\n\nThen, the ethical side. The neighbor was being loud, but the author took matters into their own hands instead of seeking legal remedies. They did contact the owner and police, but when that didn't work, they resorted to breaking in. The falling out between them might have escalated tensions, but that doesn't justify illegal actions. The author's actions could have been dangerous, maybe caused harm, or violated privacy. Even if the intention was to stop noise, the method was excessive. Cutting the cord was destructive, which could lead to property damage charges. \n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling guilty, which suggests they recognize something was wrong. The justification here is about self-help, but society generally requires people to go through proper channels. So, even if the neighbor was being inconsiderate, the author's response crosses a line. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
