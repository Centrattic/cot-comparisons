I live in a pretty shitty triplex to save some money. I can hear almost everything that my neighbors on both sides can do. One side is a lawyer who has the apartment as one of his outreach offices so he's cool (though I've heard some crazy things about the mindset of petty criminals). Other side is this dude Warren who was cool at first but we had a falling out a few weeks ago because he's sort of a douche and I stopped inviting him over. \n\nWarren started blasting his music as a way to get revenge on me. Both me and the lawyer have called the cops, called the building owner and Warren always gets a warning then chills for the rest of the day but almost always starts up again about noon the next day. \n\nLast night, I hear Warren's music kick on about 8 but then I heard him leave. After \"Then I got high\" played for the 10th time I knew he was fucking with me. I texted him and asked him when he was coming back. He said \"oh shit sorry man, not coming back until Tuesday. So sorry.\" I called the owner, she said there was nothing she could do, I called the cops and they came over and said there wasn't anything they could do without a warrant. She said she would talk to her supervisor about getting a warrant but I never heard back from her. I tried to drown out the music with my headphones but couldn't take it anymore. \n\nSo at like 2AM I hoped over his fence and pulled up his sliding glass door (you can jimmy the non-sliding side on all three units) and went in his apartment and non only turned his shit off, I cut the cord to his 2003 circa ipod clock radio that he using to repeat the song. I then wiped off all my fingerprints as best I could and went home and slept soundly. \n\nNo fallout yet, but I feel a little guilty and I certainly shouldn't have cut the cord to his ipod player. But am I an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is that the author broke into their neighbor's apartment to stop him from playing loud music. The neighbor, Warren, was playing music on repeat while he was away over the weekend. The author tried calling the cops and the building owner, but they couldn't do anything without a warrant. So the author took matters into their own hands.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Breaking into someone's property is definitely illegal, regardless of the reason. Even if it's to stop noise, which is a legitimate annoyance, entering without permission is a crime. The author mentions cutting the cord of the neighbor's iPod clock radio. That's vandalism, which is also a criminal offense. So legally, the author is in the wrong.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author had a conflict with the neighbor and had tried contacting authorities, but they wanted immediate action. However, taking the law into their own hands by breaking in is not the right approach. There might be other legal steps they could have taken, like getting a restraining order or seeking a noise complaint through proper channels. The fact that they did it to retaliate after a falling out adds another layer\u2014maybe the neighbor's actions were vindictive, but that doesn't justify illegal behavior.\n\nAlso, the author used a throwaway to post, showing they know they did something wrong. They feel guilty, which suggests they recognize their actions might be morally wrong. Even though the intention was to stop the noise, the method was unlawful and destructive. The author could have faced criminal charges if caught, which is a serious consequence.\n\nIn terms of whether they're an asshole, the question is whether their actions were reasonable. Most people would agree that breaking into someone's home is not acceptable. Even if the neighbor was being a jerk, there are legal ways to handle it. The author's actions risked their own freedom and the neighbor's property. So, yes, they are in the wrong.\n"
