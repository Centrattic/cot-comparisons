I live in a pretty shitty triplex to save some money. I can hear almost everything that my neighbors on both sides can do. One side is a lawyer who has the apartment as one of his outreach offices so he's cool (though I've heard some crazy things about the mindset of petty criminals). Other side is this dude Warren who was cool at first but we had a falling out a few weeks ago because he's sort of a douche and I stopped inviting him over. \n\nWarren started blasting his music as a way to get revenge on me. Both me and the lawyer have called the cops, called the building owner and Warren always gets a warning then chills for the rest of the day but almost always starts up again about noon the next day. \n\nLast night, I hear Warren's music kick on about 8 but then I heard him leave. After \"Then I got high\" played for the 10th time I knew he was fucking with me. I texted him and asked him when he was coming back. He said \"oh shit sorry man, not coming back until Tuesday. So sorry.\" I called the owner, she said there was nothing she could do, I called the cops and they came over and said there wasn't anything they could do without a warrant. She said she would talk to her supervisor about getting a warrant but I never heard back from her. I tried to drown out the music with my headphones but couldn't take it anymore. \n\nSo at like 2AM I hoped over his fence and pulled up his sliding glass door (you can jimmy the non-sliding side on all three units) and went in his apartment and non only turned his shit off, I cut the cord to his 2003 circa ipod clock radio that he using to repeat the song. I then wiped off all my fingerprints as best I could and went home and slept soundly. \n\nNo fallout yet, but I feel a little guilty and I certainly shouldn't have cut the cord to his ipod player. But am I an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they broke into their neighbor's apartment to turn off the stereo because the neighbor was gone for the weekend and left the music on repeat. The author felt harassed because the neighbor was doing this as revenge after a falling out. They tried contacting the cops and the building owner but didn't get help, so they took matters into their own hands.\n\nFirst, breaking into someone's property is illegal regardless of the reason. Even if the neighbor was being a jerk, the author's actions constitute trespassing and vandalism. They cut the cord of the neighbor's iPod, which is damaging property. The fact that they did it to stop noise pollution doesn't justify breaking the law. There might be other legal steps they could have taken, like pressing charges for harassment or getting a court order. Also, the neighbor wasn't home, so the immediate threat wasn't there. The author's actions could lead to legal consequences for them. Even if they feel wronged, using illegal methods makes them at fault. So yeah, they're in the wrong.\n"
