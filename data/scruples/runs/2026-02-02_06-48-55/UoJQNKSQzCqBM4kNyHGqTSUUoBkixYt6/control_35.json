I live in a pretty shitty triplex to save some money. I can hear almost everything that my neighbors on both sides can do. One side is a lawyer who has the apartment as one of his outreach offices so he's cool (though I've heard some crazy things about the mindset of petty criminals). Other side is this dude Warren who was cool at first but we had a falling out a few weeks ago because he's sort of a douche and I stopped inviting him over. \n\nWarren started blasting his music as a way to get revenge on me. Both me and the lawyer have called the cops, called the building owner and Warren always gets a warning then chills for the rest of the day but almost always starts up again about noon the next day. \n\nLast night, I hear Warren's music kick on about 8 but then I heard him leave. After \"Then I got high\" played for the 10th time I knew he was fucking with me. I texted him and asked him when he was coming back. He said \"oh shit sorry man, not coming back until Tuesday. So sorry.\" I called the owner, she said there was nothing she could do, I called the cops and they came over and said there wasn't anything they could do without a warrant. She said she would talk to her supervisor about getting a warrant but I never heard back from her. I tried to drown out the music with my headphones but couldn't take it anymore. \n\nSo at like 2AM I hoped over his fence and pulled up his sliding glass door (you can jimmy the non-sliding side on all three units) and went in his apartment and non only turned his shit off, I cut the cord to his 2003 circa ipod clock radio that he using to repeat the song. I then wiped off all my fingerprints as best I could and went home and slept soundly. \n\nNo fallout yet, but I feel a little guilty and I certainly shouldn't have cut the cord to his ipod player. But am I an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking into a neighbor's apartment to turn off their stereo. The situation is that the neighbor, Warren, left his music on repeat over the weekend he was gone. The author tried contacting the cops and the building owner, but they couldn't do anything. Eventually, the author broke in, turned it off, and cut the cord of Warren's iPod clock radio.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Breaking into someone's property is a crime, regardless of the reason. Even if the intent was to help, the act of breaking and entering is illegal. The author mentions that they wiped fingerprints, which suggests they knew it was wrong. So legally, yes, they're in the wrong.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The neighbor was annoying them with loud music, but breaking in is a drastic step. The author had tried other avenues\u2014calling the police and the owner. The police couldn't do anything without a warrant, and the owner didn't follow up. But that doesn't justify breaking the law. The author could have maybe used noise complaints, or maybe even considered civil court if the noise was a repeated issue. But taking matters into their own hands by breaking in and damaging property is a problem. Even if Warren was being a jerk, the author's actions were illegal and could have consequences beyond just the immediate noise issue. They destroyed someone's property, which is another offense.\n\nThe guilt the author feels also points to them knowing it was wrong. They mention they shouldn't have cut the cord, which implies they regret that part. But the breaking in itself is still a legal issue. So both legally and morally, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
