I live in a pretty shitty triplex to save some money. I can hear almost everything that my neighbors on both sides can do. One side is a lawyer who has the apartment as one of his outreach offices so he's cool (though I've heard some crazy things about the mindset of petty criminals). Other side is this dude Warren who was cool at first but we had a falling out a few weeks ago because he's sort of a douche and I stopped inviting him over. \n\nWarren started blasting his music as a way to get revenge on me. Both me and the lawyer have called the cops, called the building owner and Warren always gets a warning then chills for the rest of the day but almost always starts up again about noon the next day. \n\nLast night, I hear Warren's music kick on about 8 but then I heard him leave. After \"Then I got high\" played for the 10th time I knew he was fucking with me. I texted him and asked him when he was coming back. He said \"oh shit sorry man, not coming back until Tuesday. So sorry.\" I called the owner, she said there was nothing she could do, I called the cops and they came over and said there wasn't anything they could do without a warrant. She said she would talk to her supervisor about getting a warrant but I never heard back from her. I tried to drown out the music with my headphones but couldn't take it anymore. \n\nSo at like 2AM I hoped over his fence and pulled up his sliding glass door (you can jimmy the non-sliding side on all three units) and went in his apartment and non only turned his shit off, I cut the cord to his 2003 circa ipod clock radio that he using to repeat the song. I then wiped off all my fingerprints as best I could and went home and slept soundly. \n\nNo fallout yet, but I feel a little guilty and I certainly shouldn't have cut the cord to his ipod player. But am I an asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author lives in a triplex where they can hear their neighbors. One neighbor is a lawyer, and the other is Warren. They had a falling out, and Warren started blasting music as revenge. The author tried contacting the cops and the building owner, but they couldn't get help. The cops said they needed a warrant. Then Warren left for the weekend, and the music was on repeat. The author broke into Warren's apartment through a fence and window, turned off the stereo, cut the cord of the iPod, and wiped their fingerprints. Now they're wondering if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, breaking into someone's property is illegal, right? Even if the motive is to stop noise, that's breaking the law. So the author did commit a crime. But the question is whether they're an asshole. Asshole is more about moral judgment, not just legality.\n\nWarren was being a jerk by playing loud music, and the author tried legal avenues but didn't get help. The author's action was to stop the noise, which is understandable. But breaking in and damaging property is a big step. Even if Warren was in the wrong, the author's response was excessive. They could have called the cops again, maybe tried to get a warrant through the owner, or used noise-cancelling methods. Instead, they took matters into their own hands.\n\nCutting the cord and wiping fingerprints shows intent to sabotage and avoid getting caught. That's a sign that the author knows their actions are wrong. Also, the fact that they feel guilty afterward suggests they recognize it's not right.\n\nSo even though Warren was being annoying, the author's actions were illegal and over the top. Therefore, they are in the wrong.\n"
