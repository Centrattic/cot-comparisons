We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group that meets at a couple's house, and after the couple had a baby, the baby becomes a distraction during game nights. The writer and others felt the baby affected their enjoyment, but they didn't want to bring it up themselves. Eventually, a DM did, and the wife was upset, feeling excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple is hosting the games, which is a big commitment. The baby is causing disruptions\u2014noises, needing attention, even an ER visit. The group includes friends, and the writer is part of a close-knit group. The main issue is whether bringing up the baby's impact was wrong.\n\nThe writer didn't want to be the one to mention it, which shows some hesitation. They were concerned about the wife's feelings and the financial situation of the couple, especially since the husband lost his job. The DM did bring it up, but the wife's reaction was strong. The writer feels bad because they wanted the wife to be included.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong: They were part of a group that felt the baby was a problem. The DM raised the issue, so it wasn't the author who directly caused the conflict. The author's empathy and concern for the wife's feelings are clear. They also didn't suggest a solution that might have been insensitive, like a babysitter.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have approached the situation more delicately. But the main action was taken by the DM. The author's role was more about supporting the group's consensus. The baby's presence was affecting everyone's enjoyment, which is valid. But the outcome was hurt feelings for the wife. Was the author wrong for being part of the group that brought up the issue?\n\nI think the key here is that the author wasn't the one to bring it up, just part of the group that felt the issue existed. The DM did the actual confrontation. So the author might not be in the wrong. The problem might be more about how the DM handled it, not the author. The author's empathy and trying to balance between the group's needs and the couple's situation seems reasonable.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
