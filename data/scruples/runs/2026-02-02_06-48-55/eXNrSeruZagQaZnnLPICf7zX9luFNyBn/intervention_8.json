We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Ask the Internet post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's causing distractions during game nights. The author mentions that everyone agreed the baby was an issue, but when the DMs brought it up, the wife was really upset and left the group chats. The author feels bad because they wanted their friend (the wife) to be included but now she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The group has been meeting for three years, and the hosts go out of their way to accommodate everyone. The baby is a new addition, and it's affecting the game. The author didn't bring up the issue directly but acknowledges that others did. The key points are: the baby is causing disruptions, the wife withdrew after the problem was raised, and the author feels responsible even though they didn't bring it up themselves.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the baby is affecting everyone's enjoyment. They tried to balance being empathetic towards the hosts and the wife. However, the wife's reaction suggests that bringing up the issue hurt her feelings, making her feel excluded. The author is conflicted because they wanted to support the wife but also maintain the game nights' quality.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. They didn't directly bring up the issue, but they were aware of the problem and agreed with others that the baby was causing issues. The problem was raised by the DMs, not the author. The author's intention was to address the distraction but didn't want to be the one to cause conflict. However, the outcome was the wife feeling excluded and upset. The author might feel responsible indirectly because they were part of the group that agreed the baby was an issue.\n\nBut the question is about the author's wrongness. The author didn't act unkindly; they expressed concern about the baby's impact. The main issue is that the wife felt her participation was being taken away. The problem might stem more from how the issue was communicated rather than the author's role. Since the author didn't bring up the issue directly, their responsibility might be less. However, as a group member who agreed the baby was a problem, they contributed to the environment where the issue was raised. But they tried to handle it by not being the one to bring it up, perhaps to avoid hurting the wife's feelings.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author didn't do anything overtly wrong. They voiced their concerns when others did, and the issue was a group consensus. The main fault might lie in how the DMs communicated the problem to the hosts, leading to the wife's reaction. The author's empathy and trying to balance both sides might mean they aren't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
