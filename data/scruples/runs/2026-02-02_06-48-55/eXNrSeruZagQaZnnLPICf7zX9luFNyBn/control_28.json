We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D game hosted at a couple's home, and their baby is causing distractions. The author, along with others, thought the baby was an issue affecting their game experience. They ended up discussing it with the hosts, which upset the wife, who then stopped participating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The hosts go out of their way to host the games, which is a big deal because the group doesn't have space otherwise. The baby is mobile, loud, and has caused interruptions, even leading to an ER visit once. The author mentions that the group collectively felt it was an issue, but they didn't take the lead; a DM did. The wife took it poorly, saying she couldn't play anymore, and she's upset. The author feels bad because they care about the wife as a friend and don't want to make her feel excluded.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. Well, they expressed their concerns as part of the group that agreed there was a problem. However, the way the issue was brought up might have been harsh. The wife left the chats and is still upset, so the manner of communication probably hurt. The author didn't take the lead in addressing it, which might be a point in their favor, but they still supported the action taken. The main issue here is whether it was wrong to voice that the baby was a problem, considering the hosts' situation and the wife's feelings.\n\nOn one hand, the group's enjoyment is important, especially since they're busy adults using the game night to unwind. On the other hand, the hosts have a baby, which is a new challenge. The author didn't suggest a solution like a babysitter, which could have been considered. However, the husband's job situation makes that difficult. The author tried to be empathetic but still felt the baby was an issue.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the group collectively felt the baby was affecting their experience. But the way the DM approached the hosts might have been insensitive. The author's responsibility is less since they weren't the one to bring it up, but they're part of the group. However, the key is whether the author's actions directly caused the problem. Since they didn't take the lead and felt empathy, maybe they aren't at fault. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
