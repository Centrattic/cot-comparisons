We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started the D&D group discussion is at fault. The situation is about a baby causing disruptions during game nights hosted by a couple.\n\nFirst, the hosts have been accommodating, providing space and game materials. When the baby was born, the wife joined the games. The baby's presence is causing issues: noise, interruptions, even a trip to the ER once. The author mentions that everyone agreed the baby was a problem, but when the DM brought it up, the wife reacted strongly and withdrew.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they want the wife to participate but also value the game nights as a way to unwind. They didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue but agreed with others that the baby was affecting everyone's enjoyment. They also consider the financial stress the couple is facing, as the husband lost his job.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the group's consensus on the problem, the wife's emotional response, and the author's intent. The author didn't start the conversation but agreed with it. They expressed empathy and tried to balance the friends' needs. Since the issue was group consensus, the author isn't the one who brought it up. However, participating in discussing the baby could be seen as contributing to the problem. But since they had a valid reason (group enjoyment) and the wife's reaction was extreme, maybe the author isn't solely to blame. The couple might need to find a solution, but the author's role was to voice a shared concern. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
