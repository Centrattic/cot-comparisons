We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong (AITA, or Am I the Asshole). The situation is about a D&D game group where the hosts have a baby that's causing issues during game nights. The author is part of the group and didn't raise the issue themselves, but others did. The wife of the hosts was upset and left the group, making the author feel guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author did something wrong. The key points here are: the baby is causing distractions, leading to stress for the group. The author mentions that everyone agreed the baby was an issue, but the DMs approached the hosts. The author didn't speak up because they weren't the DM and didn't want to be the one to bring it up. Now the wife is upset and the author feels bad.\n\nSo, the author's main action was not being the one to address the problem. The group as a whole addressed it through the DMs, which might be appropriate since the DMs are more central to the game's structure. The author's hesitation could be seen as a lack of communication, but they might be trying to avoid conflict.\n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. If everyone in the group agreed the baby was a problem, maybe the author isn't at fault for not being the one to bring it up. However, the author might have a responsibility to voice their concerns if they're part of the group. On the other hand, the hosts are providing a space, and the baby's presence is a personal life situation that might be beyond their control.\n\nThe author's empathy is clear, but the group's enjoyment is also important. The DMs brought it up, so maybe that's the right approach. The author might not be in the wrong if they were part of the consensus and supported the DMs' actions without being the one to raise it first. The wife's reaction is more about the hosts handling it, not the author specifically. The author's role here didn't require them to be the one to speak up, especially if they weren't the DM. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
