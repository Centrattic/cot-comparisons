We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a D&D group where they host their games at a couple's house. The couple had a baby, and the baby is causing some issues during the game sessions. The author didn't bring up the issue directly but others did, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, the main point is that the baby is being a distraction. The baby is loud, mobile, causing interruptions, and even leading to an ER visit. The group agreed it was an issue, so they addressed it. But the wife reacted strongly to the DM bringing it up, feeling excluded from the games now. The author feels bad because they wanted the wife to be part of the group again but didn't bring up the issue themselves.\n\nNow, the author's question is whether they're at fault. The user thinks the author is at fault, but I need to decide if that's right. Let's break down the factors.\n\nThe author didn't bring up the issue directly, which might be seen as a way to avoid conflict. However, the group as a whole discussed the problem and the DM addressed it. The author might have felt uncomfortable being the one to bring it up, especially since they're not the DM. But the problem was already affecting everyone's enjoyment, so it's reasonable that it needed to be discussed.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction suggests that the way the issue was raised might have been hurtful. The author empathizes with her, indicating they understand her feelings. However, the core issue is the baby's impact on the game. The author wasn't the one who brought it up, but they might share some responsibility for not figuring out a way to address it more sensitively beforehand.\n\nBut wait, the author mentions that they tried to deal with the issue for a few months. The problem was that the baby was causing significant disruptions, and the group collectively decided it was an issue. The author didn't suggest solutions like a babysitter, which might have been a way to handle it without making the wife feel excluded. However, the author also acknowledges that suggesting a babysitter might be impractical given the husband's job loss.\n\nSo, the main conflict arose when the DM brought it up, not the author. The author's role was more passive, not directly confronting the issue. But should they have approached the couple privately first, perhaps before the group discussion? Or maybe they thought the DM was the right person to handle it since they're the DM. But the wife's reaction was more about feeling excluded rather than the issue itself. The author might have contributed to the problem by not addressing it earlier or in a way that considered the wife's perspective.\n\nHowever, the author's intention was to include the wife, which is commendable. The problem was the baby's effect on the game, not the wife herself. The author might not be in the wrong because the issue needed to be addressed, and the way it was handled by the DM led to the wife's upset. The author's empathy and not bringing it up directly might actually show consideration.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were likely not in the wrong. They tried to manage the situation without causing more conflict, and the main issue was the baby's disruption. The wife's reaction is more about how the DM approached it rather than the author's role. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
