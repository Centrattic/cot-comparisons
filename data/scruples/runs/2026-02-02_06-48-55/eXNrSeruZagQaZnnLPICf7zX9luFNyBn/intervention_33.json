We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the D&D group has been meeting at a couple's house for three years. After the couple had a baby, the baby became a distraction during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is loud, causes interruptions, and even led to an ER visit. The group discussed the issue and a DM brought it up to the couple, which upset the wife. The author feels bad about it but is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, first, the author's intent was to address a problem that was affecting everyone's enjoyment. They tried to avoid being the one to bring it up because they didn't want to hurt their friend's feelings. But when the DM did bring it up, it caused a rift. The key points here are communication, empathy, and group dynamics.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if they didn't approach the situation sensitively enough. Even though the baby was an issue, the wife was trying to participate in the games, which is important to her. The author and the group might not have considered other solutions before just bringing it up. For example, maybe they could have discussed options like a babysitter, even though they felt it might be too expensive. Or maybe adjusting the game times or location. The fact that the wife is now upset and has distanced herself suggests that the conversation wasn't handled well.\n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to avoid being the one to bring it up, which shows some consideration. However, the group's consensus was the baby was a problem, so they might feel it was necessary. The issue here is balancing the group's needs with the couple's personal situation. The author might not be at fault entirely, but there's a case to be made that they could have approached it more thoughtfully, perhaps by being more direct and empathetic, or by suggesting practical solutions rather than just stating the problem.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is part of a group that collectively agreed on the issue, so maybe they're not solely responsible. But the reaction of the wife indicates that the way it was communicated was hurtful. The author might have contributed to the problem by being part of the consensus that led to the confrontation, even if they weren't the one to bring it up. The empathy the author feels is valid, but maybe they should have considered the emotional impact more before supporting the conversation.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there are elements where they could have handled it better. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong, the answer depends on whether the problem was valid and how it was addressed. Since the baby was causing real issues, the author isn't entirely at fault, but the way the problem was communicated might have been the issue. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that the approach could have been improved.\n"
