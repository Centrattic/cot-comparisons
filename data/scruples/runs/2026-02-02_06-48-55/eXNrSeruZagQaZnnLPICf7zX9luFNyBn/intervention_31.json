We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through their situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is part of a D&D group that meets weekly. The hosts are a married couple who have been hosting for three years. They moved their stuff around their basement for the group, provided snacks, and the husband has a lot of game supplies. The group appreciates their hospitality. Then the couple had a baby, which is a year old now. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. They had an incident where the baby went to the ER during a game night. The wife started playing in the games, which the author was excited about. \n\nThe problem is that the baby causes disruptions: people have to leave the game to tend to the baby, which makes the game stall or them miss parts of the story or combat. The author mentions that everyone agreed the baby was an issue, affecting their enjoyment. Since they are busy adults and game nights are their way to unwind, it's causing stress. The author didn't bring it up as they weren't the DM, but eventually, a DM did, and the wife took it badly, saying she can't play again and has removed herself from group chats. The author feels bad and is worried about the wife's feelings. They don't want to suggest a babysitter because the husband just lost his job.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA). The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they're asking for my opinion.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The key points are:\n\n- The hosts have been generous in providing space and resources for the group.\n- The baby is a new element that's causing disruptions.\n- The group collectively agreed the baby is an issue.\n- The author didn't raise the issue themselves but felt others did.\n- The wife reacted negatively and left the group.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author's role here was to participate in the games. The main issue is that the baby is causing problems for everyone's enjoyment. The author mentions that they didn't want to be the one to bring it up, which might suggest they felt uncomfortable doing so. But the group as a whole agreed it was a problem, so it's a collective concern.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if they didn't do their part to address the issue in a sensitive manner. However, they are not the hosts, and they are friends with the wife. They might have felt conflicted about bringing it up, especially considering the wife's recent ability to join the group. The fact that a DM eventually did bring it up suggests that the group as a whole needed to address it, not just the author.\n\nThe wife's reaction was extreme, but perhaps the way the issue was raised was not handled well by the DM. The author's empathy for the wife's feelings is valid, but the group's overall enjoyment is also important. The author might not be in the wrong because they were part of the group that acknowledged the issue, and the DM took the lead in addressing it. The author's intention wasn't to exclude the wife but to address a shared problem. They also considered the financial situation of the hosts, which shows they tried to be understanding.\n\nHowever, maybe the author didn't do enough to find a solution before the problem escalated. For example, suggesting a babysitter might have been an option, but they were aware of the husband's job situation. The author might feel guilty for not being the one to bring it up, but since they weren't the DM, it's possible the DM was the appropriate person. The author's role was more of a participant, so maybe they aren't responsible for the outcome. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the group as a whole agreed there was a problem. The author's part was to voice their concerns if they felt comfortable. Since they didn't, maybe they share some responsibility, but since the DM did, perhaps they aren't in the wrong. The key is whether the author should have addressed it themselves or if the group's consensus was enough. \n\nAlso, the author's main regret is that the wife felt excluded and is upset. The author might feel they contributed to that by not handling the situation better, but the main action was taken by the DM. The author's empathy and not wanting to suggest a babysitter shows they tried to be considerate. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They were part of a group that recognized the issue and let the DM handle it. The problem was more about how the DM approached the hosts, not the author's direct actions. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
