We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's causing disruptions during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is loud, a distraction, and even led to an ER visit once. They say that everyone agreed it was an issue, but when one of the DMs brought it up, the wife reacted negatively, saying she can't play anymore and has withdrawn from group chats.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The hosts have been accommodating for three years, providing space and supplies. The baby is a new addition, and the group's dynamics changed. The author didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue, so they let the DM handle it. But the outcome was the wife being upset and leaving the games. The author feels responsible because they wanted the wife to stay as a friend.\n\nThe key points here are whether the group handled the situation appropriately. They did try for a few months before bringing it up. The problem is that the baby's presence is affecting everyone's enjoyment of the game, which is their time to unwind. However, the way the issue was raised might have been too abrupt or not sensitive enough. The wife's reaction suggests she felt excluded or blamed. The author empathizes with her, which shows they care about her feelings.\n\nThe author isn't the one who raised the issue, but they did contribute to the consensus that the baby was a problem. However, the hosts might have expected that having a baby would require some adjustments. The group might have needed to discuss possible solutions first, like a babysitter, playing at a different time, or changing the venue. The author mentions not wanting to suggest a babysitter because of the husband's financial situation, but maybe there were other options they didn't consider.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one who directly brought up the issue, but they were part of the group that felt it was a problem. The DM's approach might have been harsh. The author's intention was to improve the game experience for everyone, but the method led to the wife feeling excluded. It's a tough spot because they have to balance the group's needs with the hosts' circumstances.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't act out of malice, but maybe they could have handled it differently. However, since they tried to be considerate and didn't want to be the one to bring it up, they might not be at fault. The main issue is how the DM communicated it, not the author. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), as they weren't the one who caused the conflict directly and were trying to be empathetic.\n"
