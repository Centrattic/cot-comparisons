We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the D&D scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a group of friends playing D&D weekly at a couple's house. The hosts had a baby, which is causing distractions and affecting the game experience. The author, along with others, felt the baby was an issue and it was brought up to the hosts by a DM. The wife reacted strongly, and the author is now questioning their role.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The hosts are friends who go out of their way to host game nights. The baby is causing disruptions, leading to missed game parts, ER visits, and discomfort for others. The author mentions that the entire group consensus was that the baby was an issue, so it wasn't just their opinion. They didn't want to be the one to bring it up, so a DM did. The wife's reaction was defensive, and the author feels guilty.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author is in the wrong. The author tried to address the issue through the DM, which makes sense since they're not the DM. They also considered the hosts' financial situation and didn't suggest a babysitter. But the wife's reaction suggests the discussion was mishandled or perhaps sensitive due to the wife's new role as a parent. The author's intention was to address the group's enjoyment but might have overlooked the emotional impact on the hosts, especially the wife who recently joined the games.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The consensus was that the baby was an issue, so it's reasonable to address it. However, the way it was handled might have been abrupt, leading to the wife's reaction. The author might not be in the wrong for bringing it up since it was a group concern, but maybe the approach could have been more sensitive. The answer hinges on whether the group's collective decision to address the issue is valid, and the author's role in supporting that decision isn't wrong. The author's empathy is noted, which shows they considered the hosts' feelings. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
