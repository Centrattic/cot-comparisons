We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario is about a D&D group where the hosts had a baby, which started causing issues during game nights. The author didn't raise the issue themselves but others did, leading to the wife being upset.\n\nFirst, the author is part of a group that plays D&D weekly. The hosts are friends who provide space and supplies. After the baby was born, the baby's presence became a distraction\u2014noise, safety issues, and people leaving the game to tend to the baby. The author mentions that the group collectively thought the baby was affecting their enjoyment. The DMs eventually brought up the issue with the couple, leading to the wife pulling out.\n\nThe author's main points: they're not the DM, so they didn't want to bring it up. They feel bad because the wife is their friend and stopped participating. They don't want to suggest a babysitter due to the hosts' financial situation.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether the author had a responsibility to address the issue. The author didn't bring it up, but others did. The author felt that the group had a consensus, so maybe they thought someone else would address it. The problem is the wife's reaction and the author's feelings of guilt.\n\nIs it the author's fault for not speaking up? Or is it the DMs' responsibility since they're leading the game? The author was a participant, not a leader. They might have felt uncomfortable bringing up the issue, especially as a friend. The main issue here is the baby's impact on the game, not the author's actions directly. However, if the group as a whole was affected, maybe the author should have considered a more supportive way to address it, like suggesting a babysitter or adjusting the game times when the baby is napping. But the author didn't do that either. However, the actual person who brought up the issue was the DM, not the author.\n\nThe author's guilt is more about the aftermath and their own feelings of regret, but were they in the wrong? If the group collectively felt the baby was a problem and the DMs addressed it, the author might not be in the wrong for not speaking up. However, the author could have contributed to a solution earlier. But the question is whether they are in the wrong for telling the hosts (via the group) that the baby is an issue. The author didn't directly confront the hosts; the DMs did. The author's part was in the group consensus. Since the author was part of that group, maybe they share some responsibility, but perhaps not the main blame. The answer would depend on whether the author's participation in the group's decision to address the issue makes them at fault. If the author was part of the group that agreed the baby was a problem, and the DMs took it up, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The key is that the author didn't directly cause the conflict but was part of the group that contributed to the problem. However, the main action was taken by the DMs, not the author. So the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
