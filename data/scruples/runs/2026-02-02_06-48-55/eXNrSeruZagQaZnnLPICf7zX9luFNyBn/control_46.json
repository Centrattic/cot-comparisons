We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where the hosts had a baby, and the baby is causing disruptions during game nights. The author didn't bring up the issue directly but others did, and now the wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The hosts are friends who go out of their way to host, which the author appreciates. The baby is mobile, loud, leading to distractions and even an ER visit. The group collectively felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment. The author didn't want to be the one to bring it up, and when a DM did, the wife reacted negatively, feeling excluded. The author feels bad because they wanted her to be part of the games.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The author didn't confront the hosts themselves but others did. The main issue here is whether it's wrong to voice concerns about the baby's impact on the game. The author's intent was to maintain a good experience for everyone, including the wife. However, the way the issue was brought up might have been handled poorly, but the author wasn't the one who raised it. The wife's reaction suggests she felt her participation was being taken away. \n\nThe author's role here was to express the group's consensus, but maybe they could have approached it more sensitively. But since the author wasn't the one who brought it up, maybe they aren't at fault. The hosts made a choice to have the baby around, and the group's right to enjoy their time should be considered. However, the wife's feelings are valid too. The author might not be in the wrong because they were part of the group's decision and tried to be empathetic, but the execution by the DM might have been the problem. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to address a group issue and the DM was the one who actually brought it up. The author feels empathy but isn't directly responsible for how the message was delivered. So the answer is B.\n"
