We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe writer is part of a D&D group that meets weekly at a couple's house. The couple started hosting after having a baby. The baby is causing issues by being noisy, distracting, and leading to disruptions during game nights. The group eventually brought up the problem to the couple, and the wife reacted negatively, pulling away from the group. The writer feels guilty because they wanted to include their friend (the wife) but now she's upset.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the writer is at fault. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the details given.\n\nFirst, the couple hosts the games and have been doing so for three years. They made sacrifices to host, including rearranging their home. When the baby came, it's understandable that the dynamics changed. The baby's presence is causing real problems: emergency room visits, constant interruptions, and stress for the group. The group didn't just randomly confront them; they tried for months and eventually a DM brought it up. The wife's reaction was emotional, feeling excluded, which is valid.\n\nThe writer isn't the DM, which is why they didn't step up. But the issue was a group consensus, not just the writer's opinion. They also considered the couple's financial situation and didn't suggest a babysitter. The problem here is balancing the group's need for a distraction-free game night with the couple's personal situation and the wife's inclusion.\n\nIs the writer wrong? Well, the group collectively addressed the issue, which is necessary for their own enjoyment. The couple chose to host, and the baby's presence is a new variable. The wife's exclusion wasn't intentional\u2014it's a result of the baby's impact on the game. The writer's intention was to address the problem to maintain the group's fun, which is understandable. However, the way the issue was brought up might have been handled better, but the root problem is the baby's effect on the games. The author probably isn't in the wrong because they were part of a collective decision to address a shared problem. The couple's hosting role might have implied that they could manage the baby's presence, but when it becomes unmanageable, the group has a right to seek a solution. So the answer might be B.\n"
