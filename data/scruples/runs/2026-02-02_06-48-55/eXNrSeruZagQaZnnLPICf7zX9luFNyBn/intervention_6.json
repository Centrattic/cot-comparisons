We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the D&D situation is in the wrong. The author is part of a group that plays D&D weekly at a couple's house. When the couple had a baby, it started causing issues during game nights\u2014distractions, the baby getting into things, and the wife having to leave to tend to him, which disrupted the game. The author didn't bring it up but says others agreed it was a problem. Eventually, a DM did bring it up, and the wife was upset, leaving the group chats and not playing anymore. The author feels bad because the wife was their friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. On one hand, the group is using their friends' home for their weekly game nights, which is important for their social and stress relief. The baby's presence is causing real disruptions that affect everyone's experience. The group came to a consensus it was an issue, so it's not just the author's opinion. They tried to handle it for a few months before someone (a DM) brought it up. The author didn't want to be the one to bring it up, which is understandable, especially since the wife is a friend.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife was excited to join the games again, and bringing up the issue made her feel excluded. The author feels empathetic towards her, which is good, but the problem is that the baby's presence is causing practical issues. The couple's home is being used, and they do make an effort to prepare the space. The husband lost his job, so suggesting a babysitter isn't feasible. The author is in a tough spot between group enjoyment and friendship.\n\nNow, the author isn't the one who actually raised the issue\u2014it was the DM. The author expressed that the group had a consensus, so it's a collective decision. The author's role was more about being part of the group's frustration rather than directly causing the conflict. However, the author might still feel responsible because they were part of the group that brought it up indirectly. \n\nBut was the author in the wrong? The main issue is whether the group's concern about the baby's impact on the game was reasonable. Since the baby is causing disruptions that affect everyone's enjoyment, it's a valid concern. The group had a right to address it to maintain their social activity. The problem is how the issue was communicated. The wife took it badly, possibly feeling that her participation as a player was being negated because of her child. The author and the group might not have considered the emotional impact on the wife and the couple as a whole. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for having a concern, but maybe the approach could have been more considerate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't act in a way that was malicious or unreasonable. They were part of a group that had a valid issue, and the problem was with how the DM communicated it, not necessarily the author's actions. Since the author didn't bring it up directly and felt empathy, they are not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
