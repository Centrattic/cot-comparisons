We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the D&D group situation is in the wrong. They provided their own opinion that the author is in the wrong, but they're asking for my take.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The group has been playing D&D at a couple's house for three years. The couple had a baby, which is causing disruptions during game nights. The baby is loud, mobile, and even led to an ER visit once. The author and others felt the baby was a distraction, leading to stress. They discussed it and a DM brought it up to the couple, leading to the wife being upset and withdrawing.\n\nThe author isn't the DM, so they didn't initiate the conversation. They mention that everyone agreed the baby was an issue. They feel bad for the wife because she's a friend and can't play now. They also don't want to suggest a babysitter because the husband just lost his job.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the group's game nights are important for them to unwind. The baby's presence is causing real problems\u2014distractions, safety issues, and stress. The author and others felt the game's quality was suffering, which is valid. They tried to address it through the DM, which is a reasonable approach.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife took it as a personal attack, possibly feeling excluded. The author didn't directly confront the couple, which might have been harsher. The author empathizes with the wife's feelings, which shows consideration. However, the problem was real and affecting everyone. Maybe there was a better way to handle it, but the author didn't act out of malice. They wanted to maintain the wife's inclusion but also the game's quality.\n\nAnother point: the author didn't suggest a solution like a babysitter, which the user might argue is their responsibility. But they considered the couple's financial situation. However, maybe there's a middle ground, like rotating hosting or finding a more child-friendly time. But the author didn't bring that up either.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for bringing up the issue? If the problem was affecting the entire group's experience, it's reasonable to address it. The author wasn't the one who brought it up first; the DM did. The author's role was to support the group's consensus. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong, but the DM might have handled the conversation poorly with the wife. The author's empathy is commendable, but the situation is complex.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are valid points on both sides, the author acted in the best interest of the group's enjoyment and tried to find a solution without being confrontational. The real issue might be how the DM approached the couple, not the author's agreement with the problem. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
