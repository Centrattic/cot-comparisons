We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the D&D situation is in the wrong (AITA). The author is part of a group that plays D&D weekly at a couple's house. After the couple had a baby, the baby became a distraction during the game. The author mentions that the baby is loud, mobile, causes interruptions, and even led to an ER visit once. The group eventually brought up the issue to the hosts, but the wife took it poorly, feeling excluded, and she's upset.\n\nThe author didn't bring it up themselves, but others did. They feel bad because the wife is a friend and now upset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and considering others' feelings. When the baby started causing issues, the author and the group tried to deal with it for a while. Then a DM brought it up to the couple. The wife reacted strongly, feeling like she can't play anymore. The author is worried they might be in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider if the author was wrong by not addressing the issue themselves. But the author said they didn't want to be the one to bring it up because they weren't the DM. The group as a whole came to a consensus that the baby was a problem, so the DM took the lead. The author seems to have empathized with the wife's feelings, so maybe they felt conflicted about it.\n\nHowever, maybe the author should have approached it differently. Perhaps they should have talked to the hosts privately before the issue escalated. But the author might have felt uncomfortable doing so, especially since the wife is a friend and the husband is unemployed. The author also didn't suggest a babysitter because they know the financial situation.\n\nIn many group situations, especially friends, it's important to address issues respectfully. The author might have missed a chance to communicate their feelings earlier, but since the group collectively addressed it through the DM, maybe it's not entirely their fault. The wife's strong reaction might be more about how the issue was presented rather than the issue itself. The author's empathy shows they care, which is positive. However, maybe they could have handled it more sensitively. Still, considering the circumstances, the author isn't the only one at fault. The hosts might need to find a solution, like a babysitter if possible. \n\nOverall, the author probably isn't in the wrong because they tried to handle it through the group and DM, and they expressed empathy. But maybe they should have tried to talk to the hosts first. However, since the DM took the lead, the author's role might not be the main issue here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
