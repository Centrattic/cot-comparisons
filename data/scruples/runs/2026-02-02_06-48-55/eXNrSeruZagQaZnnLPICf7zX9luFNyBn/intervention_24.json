We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the D&D scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a group of adults playing D&D weekly at a couple's house. After the couple had a baby, the baby became a distraction during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is loud, causes interruptions, and even led to an emergency room visit. The group eventually discussed the issue with the hosts, leading to the wife being upset and leaving the group chats.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The hosts have been accommodating, providing space and resources for the group. The baby is a new element, and the author admits that the group collectively felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment. However, the way the issue was addressed might be problematic. The author didn't want to be the one to bring it up, so a DM did, which upset the wife. The author feels empathy but is conflicted about suggesting a babysitter due to the husband's job loss.\n\nNow, the key points to analyze: \n\n1. **Was the issue valid?** The baby's presence clearly disrupts the game. The group's enjoyment is hindered, which is a legitimate concern. But how they addressed it is crucial.\n\n2. **Approach to the hosts:** The author didn't want to bring it up themselves, which might indicate they didn't want to be direct. However, the DM did bring it up, which might have been abrupt or not framed sensitively. The wife took it as a personal attack, leading to her withdrawal. The group's approach might have lacked empathy.\n\n3. **Alternatives considered:** The author considered not suggesting a babysitter due to financial constraints. However, maybe other solutions could have been proposed first, like adjusting game times when the baby is asleep, or taking turns hosting elsewhere temporarily. The group might have not explored all options before confronting the hosts.\n\n4. **Impact on the wife:** She was excited to join the game, which is a significant part of social interaction. The group's actions led to her feeling excluded, which the author feels guilty about. This suggests the method of addressing the issue might have been harsh without considering her feelings.\n\n5. **Shared responsibility:** The author mentions that the group came to a consensus. If the entire group was behind the decision, individual responsibility might be diffused. However, the way it was communicated is on the group, and the author shares in that responsibility by not speaking up or suggesting a gentler approach.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the author might not be entirely at fault because the issue of the baby causing disruptions is real. However, the way the problem was addressed without sensitivity could be where they went wrong. The question is whether the approach was considerate enough. The author's empathy and guilt indicate they recognize the problem's impact, but perhaps the communication was lacking.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the method of addressing the issue was appropriate. If the group should have approached the hosts with more care and offered solutions instead of just pointing out the problem, then the author (as part of the group) might be in the wrong. However, if the issue was unavoidable and the hosts should adjust their hosting environment, then the author is not in the wrong. Given the wife's reaction and the suddenness of the confrontation, it seems the communication could have been better. Therefore, the author might share some blame for not ensuring a more empathetic approach.\n"
