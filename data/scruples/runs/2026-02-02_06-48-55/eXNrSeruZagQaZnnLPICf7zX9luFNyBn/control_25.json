We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong (AITA) for telling the hosts of their D&D game that their baby is an issue. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, they've been part of a D&D group for three years, meeting at the hosts' house. The hosts rearrange their basement, provide snacks, and have a lot of game stuff. The hosts had a baby, and the wife started playing in the games. The baby is causing problems: being loud, mobile, distractions, and even led to an ER visit once. The group decided the baby was affecting everyone's enjoyment. They tried dealing with it for months before the DMs brought it up. The wife took it badly, saying she can't play again and left the group chats. The author feels bad because they wanted to include their friend.\n\nThe author didn't directly bring it up but was part of the group consensus. They didn't want to be the one to bring it up, so a DM did. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are that the group as a whole felt the baby was an issue and that they discussed it. The author didn't confront the hosts alone but let the DMs handle it. However, the wife was upset and left. The author feels they wanted to include the wife, so maybe they feel guilty for contributing to the problem.\n\nIs it wrong to express a legitimate concern about something that's impacting the group's enjoyment? The group was in agreement, so it wasn't just the author's opinion. The hosts were providing a space for everyone, but the baby's presence was making it hard to play. The author tried to avoid being the one to bring it up, which is considerate.\n\nBut maybe the way it was handled could have been better. They didn't suggest alternatives like a babysitter, knowing the husband's financial situation. However, the author didn't propose that because they felt it would be unfair. So they tried to be empathetic.\n\nThe wife's reaction was extreme, but the group's issue was valid. The author's intention was to maintain the game's quality for everyone, including their friend. So the author isn't in the wrong because they were part of a group decision and tried to be sensitive. The problem wasn't just their personal opinion but a collective one. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
