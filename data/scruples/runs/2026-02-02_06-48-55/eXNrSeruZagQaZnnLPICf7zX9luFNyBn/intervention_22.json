We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D game hosted by a couple where the baby is causing disruptions. The author mentions that the baby is a distraction, leading to interruptions during game nights. They tried to avoid bringing it up themselves, but eventually, a DM did, and the wife reacted negatively, removing herself from the group chats.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple hosts the game at their home, which is a significant contribution. The baby's presence is causing issues, but the author and others agree it's a problem. However, the way the issue was addressed led to the wife feeling excluded, even though she's a friend.\n\nThe author's intention was to address the problem to improve their game nights, which is understandable. They didn't want to be the one to bring it up, so they let the DM do it. The wife's reaction was hurtful, and the author feels bad about it. But was the author wrong in bringing up the issue? Well, they were part of a consensus that the baby was a problem. It's a group activity, so the group's experience matters. However, the approach might have been flawed. Maybe they could have discussed it more sensitively with the couple first, perhaps suggesting solutions like a babysitter, which they didn't want to impose due to financial reasons.\n\nThe key points are: the host couple's contributions, the baby's impact on the game, the group's consensus on the issue, and the wife's emotional reaction. The author's empathy is clear, but the problem is whether they had the right to voice the issue. Since it's a group decision, it's not just the author's fault. However, the author's participation in the discussion and not taking the lead in a more delicate approach might contribute to the problem. Alternatively, it's a group activity, and addressing the issue is necessary for everyone's enjoyment. The answer might hinge on whether the approach was considerate enough. The author might not be in the wrong because it's a collective issue, but they could have handled it better. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering that the problem was valid and the group consensus, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the way it was communicated might have been the issue. The DM brought it up, so the author isn't the one who directly caused the conflict. But the author agreed with the issue and supported the discussion. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because addressing a problem that affects the group is reasonable, even if the method could have been better. The author isn't the one who directly caused the hurt feelings, the DM did. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
