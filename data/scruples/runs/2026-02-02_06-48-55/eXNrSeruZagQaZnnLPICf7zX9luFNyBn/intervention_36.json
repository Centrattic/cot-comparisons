We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a D&D group that meets at a couple's house. After the couple has a baby, the baby becomes a distraction during game nights, leading to the group discussing the issue. The author wasn't the one to bring it up, but they participated in the consensus. The wife reacted badly and left the group chats.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The hosts are friends who go out of their way to host the games. The baby's presence is causing disruptions, but the author isn't the one who raised the issue. The DM did. However, the author mentions they were part of the consensus. So, maybe the group collectively decided to address it, but the way it was handled upset the wife.\n\nThe author feels guilty because they care about the wife's feelings. They didn't want to suggest a babysitter due to the husband's unemployment. The key points are whether the group had the right to bring up the issue and if the approach was considerate.\n\nOn one hand, the group has a right to enjoy their game nights, and the baby's disruptions are affecting everyone. On the other hand, the hosts are friends, and the wife's inclusion was important, especially since she's a friend. The author might feel responsible for supporting the decision, even if they weren't the one to initiate it.\n\nThe wife's reaction suggests she felt excluded or blamed. The group might not have communicated the issue in a sensitive way. The author's empathy is there, but the problem lies in how the issue was addressed. The author participated in the consensus, so they share some responsibility, even if not as the one who started it.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the group collectively decided to address the issue, perhaps the fault isn't just on the author. However, the way the issue was brought up could have been more tactful. The author's participation in the consensus might mean they contributed to a group dynamic that hurt a friend. But since the DM was the one to bring it up, maybe the author isn't directly in the wrong. It's a bit tricky. The answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because the group had valid concerns and the author wasn't the one to raise it, but they are part of the group's decision. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) if the approach was too harsh and the author should have found a more considerate solution. Hmm. Given the context, the answer is likely B because the group had a legitimate issue and the author wasn't the one to bring it up directly, but they might need to take some responsibility in helping to resolve the situation more sensitively. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer is B because they aren't the one who initiated the conversation, but they are part of a group that had a valid concern. The main wrongdoer might be the DM for how it was presented. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
