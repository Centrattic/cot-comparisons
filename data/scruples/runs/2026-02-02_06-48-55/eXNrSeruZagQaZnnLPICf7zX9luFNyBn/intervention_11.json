We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D game group where the hosts have a baby, and the baby is causing issues during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is a distraction, leads to interruptions, and even caused an emergency room visit once. They say that the group agreed it was a problem, and one of the DMs brought it up to the hosts. The wife took it badly, feeling like she can't play anymore, and the author feels guilty because they wanted her to be part of the group.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider if it's the author's responsibility to bring up the issue. The author says they didn't want to be the one to bring it up because they weren't the DM. But the group as a whole had consensus that the baby was affecting their experience. The author might feel they weren't directly responsible, but maybe everyone's role in the group is a factor. \n\nThen there's the impact on the wife. She felt excluded and withdrew from the group. The author is friends with her and feels bad. The author also mentions not wanting to suggest a babysitter because of financial constraints. So maybe they thought they had no right to ask for money, but the main issue was the baby's presence affecting the game.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the group decided the baby was an issue, so maybe it's a shared problem, not just the author's. However, the author did participate in the discussion where the issue was raised, which led to the wife's reaction. If the author didn't raise it themselves but was part of the group that agreed it was a problem, maybe they're not entirely at fault. But maybe they should have found a way to address it without making the wife feel excluded. \n\nAlternatively, the DM was the one who brought it up formally, so maybe the author is not the one to blame. The author might have supported the decision but didn't act as the one to communicate it. However, the author's guilt comes from being friends with the wife. The key is whether bringing up the issue was necessary and how it was handled. If the group collectively decided and the DM was the one to talk to the couple, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the way the issue was handled led to the wife feeling excluded, which might mean that the group, including the author, should have considered other solutions first, like agreeing on a time when the baby isn't around or adjusting the game schedule.\n\nOn the other hand, the hosts are providing a space for the group, and the baby is part of their life. Maybe the group should have been more understanding or offered help instead of just raising the issue. The author might not be in the wrong for expressing a shared concern, but the way it was handled could have been more considerate. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is part of the group that agreed on the problem and supported the DM's action, they might not be at fault. The main issue is the wife's reaction and the group's approach, but the author isn't the one who directly caused the conflict. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the problem was a group consensus, and the author didn't personally bring it up. However, there's a possibility that the group, as a whole, should have handled it differently. Since the author is feeling guilty but didn't act in a way that directly harmed the wife, maybe they aren't at fault. Alternatively, if the author participated in the group's decision without considering the wife's feelings, they could share some responsibility. But the main action was taken by the DM, so the author might not be in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
