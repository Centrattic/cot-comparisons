We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their D&D game hosts that their baby is a problem. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the hosts have been hosting the group for three years, providing space, snacks, and game stuff. Then they had a baby. The baby's presence is causing issues\u2014noise, distractions, even an ER visit once. The group, including the author, decided the baby is affecting their enjoyment. The DM finally brought it up, and the wife reacted badly, pulling out of the game and group chats.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they care about the wife's feelings but also want the game to be fun again. They don't blame the baby but the situation. They didn't want to suggest a babysitter because they know the family's financial situation.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are whether the group collectively addressed the issue (they did) and if the approach was respectful. The DM brought it up, not just the author. The author might feel guilty for the outcome but shared a common concern. The hosts had to make adjustments, which they might not have considered otherwise. However, the way the wife took it personally and left is a problem. The author's intention was to improve the game experience for everyone, which is valid. But maybe they should have handled it more delicately. However, since it was a group decision and the DM brought it up, the author isn't solely responsible. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
