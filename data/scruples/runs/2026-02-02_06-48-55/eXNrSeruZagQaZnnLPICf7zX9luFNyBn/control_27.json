We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group that's been meeting for 3 years at the home of a married couple. The couple had a baby, and the baby is causing issues during game nights. The main problem is that the baby is a distraction, leading to pauses in the game, stress, and even a trip to the ER once. The group eventually brought this up to the couple, but the wife took it badly, saying she can't play anymore and has removed herself from the group chats.\n\nThe author says that they weren't the one to bring up the issue, but they were part of the group consensus that the baby was a problem. They feel bad because they wanted the wife to be included. They also note that suggesting a babysitter might be unfair financially since the husband just lost his job.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about group dynamics, communication, and empathy. The group had a consensus, so it wasn't just one person's opinion. The hosts had rearranged their home for the game nights, which they went out of their way to do. The baby's presence is affecting the game's enjoyment for everyone. The author mentions that the group came to this consensus, so they weren't acting alone. However, the way the issue was raised might have been handled poorly, leading to the wife's hurt feelings.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't bring up the issue directly but was part of the group that discussed it. The problem here is that the hosts are friends, and the wife was excited to join. The group's action led to her feeling excluded, which complicates things. The author's empathy is noted, but the outcome was negative for the wife.\n\nIs the problem the author's fault? They tried to include her and felt bad. But the group's decision to address the issue, even if consensual, might have been done without considering the emotional impact. The hosts might have felt that their home and the baby's presence were not being valued. The author's participation in the group consensus could mean shared responsibility, but since they didn't take the lead, maybe not entirely their fault.\n\nHowever, the group's approach might have been too direct without offering solutions, like the babysitter idea. But the author mentions they didn't suggest it because of financial constraints. So maybe the group didn't consider alternatives. The hosts might have felt attacked, leading to the wife's withdrawal. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the group had a legitimate concern about their game being disrupted. But addressing it in a way that respects the hosts' situation is crucial. The author's participation in the group's decision isn't necessarily wrong, but perhaps the approach taken was flawed. However, the question is about the author specifically. Since they were part of the group that decided the baby was an issue, but didn't take the lead, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The main responsibility might lie with the DM who actually brought it up. The author's empathy is there, but the outcome is a result of the group's action. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
