We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's causing disruptions during game nights. The author, along with others, thought the baby was a problem and it was brought up by a DM. The wife got upset, left the group chats, and the author feels bad about it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The hosts have been providing a space for the group for three years, which is a big commitment. When the baby came, it's causing issues like noise, distractions, and even an ER visit. The group tried to handle it for a few months, but eventually, the DM had to bring it up. The wife reacted strongly, and now the author is feeling guilty.\n\nThe author's main points are that the baby is a distraction, affecting everyone's enjoyment, and they wanted to address it. But they didn't want to be the one to bring it up, so the DM did. The problem here is that the author is part of a group that collectively felt this way, and the issue was discussed. However, the author didn't directly confront the hosts themselves, which might be a point of consideration.\n\nThe author mentions not wanting to suggest a babysitter because the husband is unemployed. So they didn't offer a solution, just pointed out the problem. The wife's reaction was emotional, feeling excluded. The author is empathetic but also concerned about their own enjoyment and the group's time.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they're part of a group that's facing real issues that affect their experience. On the other hand, the hosts are friends, and bringing up the baby as an issue could be seen as insensitive, especially without offering support like a babysitter solution. The author didn't want to suggest paying for a sitter, which is understandable, but maybe there's a way to address the problem without making the wife feel excluded.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had a right to voice the problem. The group consensus was that it's an issue, so maybe the author isn't wrong for wanting to be honest. However, the way it was communicated might have been harsh, leading to the wife's upset. The author might not be in the wrong for expressing the group's concerns, but perhaps they could have handled it more sensitively. \n\nBut the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the group collectively decided to address it, maybe the author isn't at fault. However, the author's empathy and the wife's reaction suggest that the approach was not handled well. The answer might depend on cultural norms or social etiquette. In some cases, being honest about how something affects you is acceptable, but in others, especially with friends, it's better to choose the right time and method. \n\nGiven that the author is not the DM and let someone else bring it up, maybe they're trying to avoid confrontation, but the outcome was still negative. The author's role here is part of a group decision, so they might not be solely at fault. However, not suggesting alternatives like a sitter (even though the husband is unemployed) might have contributed to the wife's feeling of being blamed. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions were to address a real issue affecting the group, but the execution might have been lacking. Whether they are in the wrong depends on perspective. If the problem was valid and collectively acknowledged, the author isn't necessarily wrong. But the way it was handled (without offering solutions) might be where the issue lies. So maybe the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the problem was real and the group decided to address it, even though the approach could have been better. Alternatively, A (in the wrong) if the author should have handled it more carefully.\n"
