We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D group that used to meet at a couple's house. After the couple had a baby, the baby became a distraction during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is loud, mobile, and has caused interruptions, leading to stress. The group eventually brought up the issue to the couple, and the wife was upset, especially since she started playing and the baby made it impossible for her to stay. The author feels bad but also thinks the baby is a problem.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is wrong but wants another opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple hosts the game nights, which are important for the group's social time. The baby is causing disruptions, affecting everyone's enjoyment. The author says the group came to a consensus that the baby was an issue. The DMs brought it up, not the author directly. The author didn't want to be the one to bring it up but was part of the discussion. The wife took it badly, feeling excluded, which the author empathizes with.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the baby is a real issue causing stress. The group needed to address it, but the way it was handled might have been poor. The problem is that the wife couldn't play anymore because she's taking care of the baby. The group's intention was to find a solution, but the communication might have been harsh. However, the author didn't take the lead in bringing it up. The main issue is whether the group was right to address the baby's impact on their game. The couple chose to host, and having a baby is their personal life. The group's right to their social time is important, but so is the couple's situation, especially the husband's job loss.\n\nBut the author is part of the group that decided the baby was an issue and supported the DM bringing it up. The author wasn't the one who caused the direct confrontation, but they still contributed to the group's consensus. However, the wife's reaction is valid because she's trying to include herself while managing the baby. The group might not have considered alternative solutions, like having game nights elsewhere or adjusting times. The author might be in the wrong if they didn't consider the couple's circumstances fully or didn't approach the situation with more empathy. But if the group collectively decided it was a problem and tried to communicate it, maybe they had a right to address it. The key is whether the group's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Since the author had empathy and felt bad, maybe they aren't the worst here. But the wife's perspective is important too. It's a tough call. I think the answer might be that they are not in the wrong because the group had a valid issue that needed addressing, but the way it was handled could be improved. So the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
