We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group that meets at a couple's house, and after the couple had a baby, the baby started causing issues during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is a distraction, leads to interruptions, and even caused an ER visit once. The group eventually brought it up, but the wife took it badly and left the chats.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The hosts had been hosting the group for three years, creating a space for everyone. After the baby, the game nights became less enjoyable because of the baby's disruptions. The author wasn't the DM, so they didn't bring up the issue directly. Instead, another DM did, and the wife reacted strongly, feeling excluded. The author is conflicted because they value their friendship with the wife.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. To determine this, I should consider if they had a right to voice the issue. The group had a consensus that the baby was a problem, so the DM bringing it up wasn't just one person's opinion. The author is part of that consensus but didn't act on it. However, they did support the DM's action, so maybe they're not entirely in the wrong. The wife's reaction is emotional, and the author feels bad for her, which shows empathy.\n\nBut did the author overstep? They didn't directly confront the hosts, but they were part of the group that decided to address the issue. The problem might be more about how the issue was communicated. If the group had tried to approach it more sensitively, maybe the wife wouldn't have felt excluded. However, the author's intention was to improve the experience for everyone, including the wife, by allowing her to be part of the game without the baby's distractions. The author might not be in the wrong because they were part of a collective decision, not a personal attack. The main issue is the wife's strong reaction, but the author's actions were to address a shared problem. So probably, the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because they acted in the group's interest and didn't do it out of malice.\n"
