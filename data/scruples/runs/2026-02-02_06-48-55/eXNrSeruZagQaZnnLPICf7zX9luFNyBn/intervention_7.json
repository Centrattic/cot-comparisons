We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault (AITA) for bringing up the issue of the baby being a distraction during their D&D game nights. The hosts had a baby, which started causing problems like noise, emergencies, and disrupting the game. The group eventually talked to the hosts, but the wife took it badly, leaving the group chats and being upset.\n\nSo, the user is saying that the group agreed the baby was a problem, but when they brought it up, especially the DM, the wife reacted negatively. The user is feeling bad because they wanted her to be part of the games. They also don't want to suggest a babysitter because the husband lost his job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The hosts are friends, and they're providing a space for the group. The baby's presence is affecting everyone's enjoyment. The user didn't bring it up themselves but was part of the consensus. The problem is that the wife left the group after the conversation, which is causing the user guilt.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they were part of a group that collectively decided the baby was an issue and then addressed it. But maybe they should have handled it differently. The user didn't start the conversation but was part of the group that did. The hosts might feel like their situation isn't being considered, especially with the husband's job loss. The user's intention was to maintain the group's enjoyment but maybe didn't consider the hosts' financial and emotional state.\n\nThe user's empathy for the wife's feelings is there, but the group's collective decision might have been necessary. However, not suggesting alternatives like a babysitter or adjusting the game times could be seen as part of the problem. The user might not be in the wrong because they were part of a group effort, but maybe they could have approached it more sensitively. However, the main issue is whether bringing up the problem is wrong. Since the group faced the issue together, maybe it's not entirely the user's fault. But the way it was handled caused a rift. The answer might be that the user isn't in the wrong, but the situation is complex. Maybe answer B (No, not in the wrong) because they were part of a group decision and addressed a collective issue, even if it had unintended consequences. But the user is feeling guilty, which complicates things. Hmm.\n"
