We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a D&D game group that's been meeting at a couple's house for three years. The couple had a baby a year ago, and the baby is causing issues during game nights. The baby is mobile, loud, sometimes causes distractions, even led to an emergency room visit once. The wife started playing but had to leave the game often to take care of the baby, which made the game less enjoyable for everyone. The author mentions that everyone agreed the baby was a problem, but when the DM brought it up, the wife took it badly and left the group chats.\n\nThe author's question is whether they're at fault for being part of the group that raised the issue. The author feels bad because the wife is a friend and now upset. They also don't want to suggest a babysitter due to the husband's unemployment.\n\nHmm. The author didn't directly bring up the issue but was part of a consensus that led to the DM raising it. The key points to consider: Was the discussion about the baby's impact necessary? The group uses game nights to unwind, and the baby is causing stress. On the other hand, the wife's feelings were hurt, and the author empathizes with her.\n\nIs it the author's fault for participating in the discussion? They might not be the one who brought it up, but they were part of the group consensus. However, the main issue is whether the group had the right to voice their concerns. Since the couple is hosting the games, maybe the group should have approached it more sensitively. The author didn't confront the hosts directly, which could be seen as avoiding direct responsibility. But the problem was raised through the DM, which is a mediator. \n\nThe author feels guilty, which suggests they think they might have done something wrong. But is it their fault? They were part of a group that collectively felt the baby was causing issues. The real problem might be how the DM approached the hosts, not the author specifically. The author's role was more passive in agreeing with others. However, contributing to a group consensus that could hurt a friend's feelings might make them share some responsibility. But I'm not sure if they're in the wrong. It's a tough situation where both sides have valid points. The answer might depend on whether the group handled it in a considerate way. Maybe they should have offered solutions first, like suggesting a babysitter if possible, but the author mentions they couldn't ask the couple for financial help. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They were part of a group trying to address an issue that was affecting everyone's enjoyment. The main issue is how the DM communicated it, not necessarily the author's participation. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
