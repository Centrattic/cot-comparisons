We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a D&D group that meets at a couple's house. The couple had a baby, and the baby is causing issues during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is a distraction, causes the parents to leave the game, and even led to an ER visit once. The group eventually brought up the issue, but the wife took it badly and left the group chats.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the group's perspective. The game nights are important for them as adults to unwind. The baby's presence is making the games stressful instead of enjoyable. The author wasn't the one who initially raised the issue, but they agree that the baby is a problem. The main question is whether the author is at fault for being part of the group that brought up the issue or for not doing it sooner.\n\nBut the author says they didn't want to be the one to approach the couple because they didn't want to hurt their friend's feelings. They felt empathy for the wife. However, the issue was finally brought up by one of the DMs, which led to the wife's reaction. The author feels bad about it.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The key points here are about communication and considering others' feelings. The group collectively felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment. It's possible that the group should have approached the situation more sensitively, maybe discussing it privately and offering solutions like suggesting a babysitter, even if they couldn't afford it themselves. But the author didn't take the lead, which might show they didn't want to confront the friends, but they were part of the group that wanted the issue addressed.\n\nThe wife's reaction suggests that she felt excluded from her own games, which is valid. The author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to address a group problem, but maybe the way the issue was brought up could have been handled better. The author's empathy is noted, and they didn't directly cause the conflict, just expressed the group's concerns. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but it's a bit nuanced.\n"
