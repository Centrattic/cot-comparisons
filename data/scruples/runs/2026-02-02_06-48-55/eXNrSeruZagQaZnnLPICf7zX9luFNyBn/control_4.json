We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a D&D game group that meets at a couple's house. The couple has a baby now, and the baby is causing distractions during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is loud, mobile, and even ended up in the ER once. The wife, who joined the games after the baby was born, is now upset because the group brought up the baby being an issue, and she feels excluded.\n\nFirst, the author didn't directly bring up the issue themselves but waited for a DM to do it. The author felt empathy for the wife's reaction because she's a friend. The group consensus was that the baby was causing problems, affecting everyone's enjoyment. They tried dealing with it for months, but it got to a point where it was causing stress instead of fun.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and considering others' feelings. The author might think it's right to address the problem since the group agreed it's an issue, but the way it was brought up might have hurt the wife's feelings. The hosts are providing a space for the games, and having a baby is a part of their life now. Maybe there's a middle ground, like suggesting a babysitter or playing at a different time when the baby is asleep. The author didn't suggest alternatives like a babysitter, which could have been considered, even if they felt bad about asking. But the author also mentions the husband's job situation, so maybe they thought it's not feasible.\n\nThe question is whether the group was wrong to bring up the issue. The problem is that the wife took it as being excluded from the games, which she recently joined. The group might have approached it in a way that didn't consider her perspective enough. The author's intention was to improve the game experience for everyone, but the result hurt their friend's feelings. So there's a conflict between the group's needs and the wife's inclusion. The author might not be in the wrong because they were part of a group consensus, but they could have handled it more sensitively. However, the main issue is that the group brought up a problem that affects the hosts' ability to host, and maybe that's valid. But the way it was communicated was poor, leading to the wife feeling excluded. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were part of a group effort, but the way the problem was addressed could have been better. But the question is specifically about the author's role. Since the author didn't directly confront the hosts and felt empathy, but the action taken by the group led to the wife being upset, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because addressing a problem is reasonable, but the execution was flawed. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong for contributing to the problem without considering the hosts' situation enough. Hmm. The author tried to navigate the situation by not bringing it up themselves, but the group did, so maybe the author isn't directly responsible. I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
