We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling the hosts of their D&D game that their baby is a problem. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe group plays D&D weekly at the home of a married couple who also host the games. They've been doing this for three years. The couple has a baby now, which is causing issues. The baby is loud, mobile, and causing distractions. It's disrupting the game, making people miss parts of the story, and even leading to an ER visit once. The author and others in the group felt the baby was affecting everyone's enjoyment. A DM finally brought up the issue to the couple, and the wife took it badly, saying she can't play anymore. The author is feeling guilty, especially since the wife is a friend, and they don't want to suggest a babysitter because the husband lost his job.\n\nHmm. The key points here are that the group had a consensus that the baby was a problem, and they wanted to address it. The author didn't bring it up directly but was part of the group that discussed it. The DM brought it up, but the wife was upset. Now the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the author's role here is that they were part of a group that collectively felt the baby was an issue. They didn't take the lead in addressing it, but they were part of the discussion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being part of the decision to address the problem. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the group had a shared problem. They didn't act out of malice but because their game nights were becoming stressful. However, maybe they should have considered how to address it more sensitively. The wife was upset because she wanted to be part of the games, and the authors wanted her to be included. But the baby was making it impossible for her to participate fully. \n\nThe author also didn't suggest a babysitter because they felt it would be unfair given the husband's job loss. That shows they tried to be considerate. The problem was that the DM brought it up, and the wife reacted poorly. The author feels bad about it but is in a dilemma between the group's enjoyment and the couple's situation.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to solve a problem that affected everyone. They didn't want to be the one to bring it up, but they were part of the group consensus. The issue is that the communication might have been handled poorly, but the author's intentions were good. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
