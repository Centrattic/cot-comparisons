We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for bringing up that the hosts' baby is an issue in their D&D game. The author is part of a group that meets weekly at the couple's home. After the birth of their baby, the baby's presence causes disruptions\u2014noise, distractions, even an ER visit. The author didn't want to be the one to raise the issue initially, but eventually, one of the DMs did, and it led to the wife being upset and leaving the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The hosts are friends, and they've been providing a space for the group. The baby is a new factor that's affecting everyone's enjoyment. The author mentions that the group collectively felt the baby was an issue, so it's not just one person's opinion. However, addressing this issue might have caused the wife to feel excluded, which the author is empathetic towards.\n\nThe author's main concern is whether they're in the wrong for contributing to the problem by not addressing it themselves earlier. The key points are: the group consensus on the issue, the author's lack of intent to be the one to bring it up, and the resulting fallout when it was addressed. \n\nFrom a group dynamics perspective, if everyone was affected, it's reasonable to address the issue collectively. However, the way it was handled might have made the wife feel like her participation as a player was being criticized. The author might not be in the wrong because they were part of a group decision, but perhaps the approach could have been more sensitive. However, since the author did express empathy and didn't want to cause harm, maybe they aren't at fault. Alternatively, maybe they should have communicated earlier to prevent the situation from escalating. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the issue was a group problem and the author wasn't the one who brought it up. But some might argue that the author should have found a more compassionate way to handle it, hence A (in the wrong). But given the information, the author was part of the group consensus and didn't take the lead, so the responsibility isn't solely on them. Hence, B seems plausible.\n"
