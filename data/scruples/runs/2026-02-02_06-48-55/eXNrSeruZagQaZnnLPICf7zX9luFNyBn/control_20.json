We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the D&D game issue is in the wrong. The situation involves a group of adults who play D&D weekly at a couple's house. The couple had a baby, which started causing disruptions during the game sessions. The person in question didn't bring up the issue themselves because they didn't want to be the one to say it, but others did. The wife was upset and left the group chats.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points are that the baby is causing distractions, leading to the game being less enjoyable. The author didn't raise the issue initially, but others did. The wife's reaction was emotional, but the problem seems to be a shared concern among the group.\n\nThe author's intention was to ensure everyone could enjoy the game. They felt empathy for the wife but also for the group's need to have a distraction-free environment. Since the group collectively decided the baby was an issue and the DMs addressed it, the author's role was more about supporting the group's consensus. They didn't force the issue alone but joined the discussion when others brought it up.\n\nHowever, the author might have contributed by not speaking up earlier, but the main responsibility was on the DMs to address it. The author's empathy and trying to balance friends' feelings isn't wrong. The wife's reaction is valid, but the problem wasn't just about her; it's about the whole group's experience. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for participating in the discussion that led to the solution.\n"
