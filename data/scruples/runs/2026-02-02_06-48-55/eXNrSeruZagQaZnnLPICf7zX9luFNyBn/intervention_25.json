We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a D&D group where the hosts had a baby, and the baby is causing distractions during game nights. The author is part of the group that's been playing there for three years, and after the baby was born, the wife started playing in the games. But now the baby is making it hard for the group to enjoy, leading to one of the DMs bringing up the issue with the couple. The wife took it badly, stopped participating, and the author feels guilty because they wanted her to be included.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author mentions that the baby is a distraction, causing noise and even a trip to the ER once. The group collectively felt it was affecting their enjoyment. The DM approached the couple, but the author was hesitant to do so themselves. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong for contributing to the discussion or not. \n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The author is part of the group that agreed the baby was an issue. But the DM actually brought it up, not the author. The author might feel they are at fault for being part of the group that wanted to address it. However, the hosts are the ones in charge of the environment. The author didn't suggest a solution like a babysitter (and also didn't want to imply that the hosts should pay for it), but they might have expressed concerns. \n\nThe wife's reaction seems extreme\u2014removing herself from group chats and still being upset. Maybe the group didn't communicate the issue properly. The author might be feeling guilty for being part of the problem, but since they didn't directly confront the couple, perhaps they aren't the one in the wrong. The hosts should have considered the impact of the baby on the group, but the group also should have discussed it respectfully. The author's empathy for the wife is noted, but the main issue is whether they are in the wrong for speaking up. \n\nI think the hosts are responsible for ensuring the environment is suitable for the games. The group's concern is valid, but the way the issue was raised might have been a problem. The author didn't act unilaterally and even had empathy, so maybe they're not in the wrong. But maybe the group should have handled it more sensitively. The answer depends on whether the author's participation in the discussion was inappropriate. Since the DM brought it up and the author was part of the consensus but didn't take the lead, perhaps the author isn't the one at fault.\n"
