We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the D&D game situation is in the wrong. The author is part of a group that plays D&D weekly at a couple's house. The couple had a baby, which started causing issues during game nights\u2014like noise, distractions, and even an ER visit. The author mentions that everyone agreed the baby was a problem, and a DM finally brought it up to the couple. The wife got upset, stopped participating, and the author feels bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The hosts are opening their home, rearranging the space, providing snacks, etc. That's a big commitment. The baby is affecting the game experience for everyone. But the author waited for someone else (the DM) to bring up the issue, not wanting to be the one. Then, after the conversation, the wife was really upset and left the group chats. The author feels guilty because the wife is a friend and wants her to be included. Also, the author mentions not wanting to suggest a babysitter due to the husband's job loss.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author's intent was to address the issue because it was affecting everyone's enjoyment. But maybe the approach wasn't handled well. However, the author wasn't the one who directly confronted the couple\u2014it was the DM. The author might feel conflicted because they wanted to support the wife's inclusion but also wanted the game to be enjoyable. \n\nPossible angles: Is the problem the baby itself or the lack of childcare? The hosts are doing their best, but the baby is a reality. Others might understand, but the game is supposed to be fun for adults. The author might have felt the need to address it, but perhaps in a more sensitive way. However, the author didn't act alone; the group consensus was that it was an issue. \n\nThe wife's reaction could be due to feeling excluded or not being considered. The author's empathy here is clear. But the author might question if there's a way to have both the wife participate and keep the game functional. Maybe suggesting alternative times or days when the baby isn't around? Or maybe the group should have been more flexible. \n\nBut given that the author is not the DM and didn't bring it up themselves, maybe they're not directly at fault. The main issue was raised by the DM, so the author isn't the one who caused the conflict. However, the author agreed with the group consensus, which led to the conversation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a social situation where there's no clear answer. The author's intent was to improve the group's experience, but it ended up hurting a friend. But the author didn't act maliciously. The hosts might need to find a solution that works for everyone, but the group also has a right to their game time. \n\nSo, I think the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong (B), because they were part of a group that collectively decided the baby was an issue, and they didn't act unilaterally. The main responsibility for how the conversation was handled falls on the DM, not the author. The author's feelings of guilt are understandable but don't make them at fault.\n"
