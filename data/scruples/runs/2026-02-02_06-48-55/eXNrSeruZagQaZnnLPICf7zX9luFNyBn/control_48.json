We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the group plays D&D every week at the hosts' home. The hosts have a baby now, which is causing distractions during game nights. The baby is mobile, loud, and even caused an ER visit once. The author mentions that after months of dealing with the problem, the DMs finally brought it up, and the wife reacted strongly, feeling excluded now. The author feels bad because they wanted her to participate and considers the financial situation of the hosts, especially the husband being unemployed.\n\nThe key points here are: the group as a whole agreed the baby was a problem, not just the author. The author tried to avoid being the one to raise the issue, which is understandable since they didn't want to hurt a friend. The problem was addressed by the DMs, but the wife still felt the impact. The author is empathetic and doesn't want to suggest a babysitter due to financial reasons.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author didn't start the conversation but was part of the group that agreed the baby was an issue. However, the decision to address it was made by the DMs, so the author isn't the one who directly caused the conflict. The author's concern is more about not wanting to hurt the wife's feelings. They tried to be considerate, but the problem was significant enough that the group had to address it. The author's empathy and consideration for the hosts' situation show they weren't acting out of malice. So, the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong. The problem was a group issue, and the author wasn't the one to bring it up. The wife's reaction is more about feeling excluded, but the group's consensus was that the baby's presence was affecting everyone's enjoyment. The author's role in this seems minimal and more about supporting the group decision rather than being the antagonist.\n"
