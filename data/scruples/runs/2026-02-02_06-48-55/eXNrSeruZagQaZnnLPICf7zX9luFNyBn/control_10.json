We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through their situation again.\n\nThey're part of a D&D group that meets at a couple's house. The couple has a baby now, and the baby is causing issues during game nights. The baby is loud, a distraction, and even led to an ER visit once. The wife started playing, but because of the baby, she's missing parts of the game. The group finally brought it up, and the wife got really upset, saying she can't play anymore. The author feels bad because they wanted her to be included, but now she's excluded. They don't want to suggest a babysitter because the husband lost his job.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong for bringing up the issue to the hosts?\n\nFirst, I should consider if the author did something wrong. They said that the group as a whole had a consensus that the baby was an issue. The author didn't want to be the one to bring it up, so a DM did. The problem arose when the wife reacted negatively. The author is feeling guilty because they empathize with her.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the group's consensus, the impact on everyone's enjoyment, and the wife's reaction. The author's intent was to address a problem that was affecting the group's experience. They didn't act alone but were part of a collective decision. However, the way the issue was brought up might have been handled poorly. The wife felt excluded, which is a valid feeling. But the author's role was more about being part of a group consensus rather than personally confronting the couple. \n\nThey also considered the couple's financial situation and didn't want to suggest a babysitter, which shows they tried to be considerate. However, the problem was the baby's presence affecting the game, not just the wife's participation. The wife had to step in to take care of the baby, which disrupted the game. It's a tough situation because it's about balancing different needs: the group's social time and the parents' responsibilities.\n\nIn terms of wrongdoings, the author didn't act alone. They tried to find a solution but the couple's hosts might have needed to address the issue themselves. Maybe the group should have approached it more sensitively or given the couple more time. But the author's main action was part of a group decision to address a known problem. They didn't single out the couple or act rudely; they were part of a collective effort. The wife's reaction was about feeling excluded, but the author's intention was to improve the group's experience, which is understandable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The problem was the situation itself, not their intent to address it. The way the DM brought it up might have been the issue, but the author's part was being part of a group consensus. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
