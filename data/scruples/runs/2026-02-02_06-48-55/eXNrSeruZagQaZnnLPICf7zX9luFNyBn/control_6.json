We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's causing distractions during game nights. The author is part of the group and didn't bring up the issue themselves, but others did, leading to the wife being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The hosts are friends who have been hosting for three years. They went out of their way to accommodate the group. The baby is a new addition, and it's affecting the game. The author mentions that the baby is loud, a distraction, and caused an ER visit. The group consensus was it was a problem, but the author didn't want to be the one to bring it up, so a DM did. The wife took it badly, pulled out, and the author feels bad about it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author didn't directly confront the hosts but others did. The author felt it was a group issue and that the baby was affecting everyone's enjoyment. The author also considered that suggesting a babysitter (which they didn't actually suggest) would be unfair given the husband's job loss.\n\nThe author's intention was to maintain the game's quality for everyone but didn't want to hurt their friend (the wife). However, by not addressing the issue themselves, maybe they contributed to the problem escalating. But the main issue was brought up by the DM, not the author. The author seems to be more of a concerned group member who felt the situation needed to be addressed but was hesitant to speak up.\n\nThe wife's reaction was intense, but that's on the hosts and how they handled the feedback, not necessarily the author. The author didn't push for a solution like a babysitter, just wanted the issue to be addressed. The problem was a group consensus, so it's a collective issue, not the author's alone.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's about responsibility and intent. The author tried to handle it by letting the DM address it, which might be the right approach. The wife's reaction is her own response, and the author didn't force her out. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They were part of a group that felt the baby was a problem and let the DM handle it. The real issue might be how the feedback was delivered, not the author's role in it.\n"
