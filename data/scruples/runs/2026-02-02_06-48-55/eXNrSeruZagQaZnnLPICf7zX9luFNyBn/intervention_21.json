We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the D&D group situation is in the wrong. The author is part of a group that plays D&D weekly at their friends' house. When the couple had a baby, it started causing issues during game nights\u2014distractions, the baby getting into things, and the wife having to leave the game to take care of him. The author mentions that the group collectively felt the baby was a problem, and they brought it up to the couple, leading to the wife being upset and withdrawing from the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple hosts these games, which are a significant part of the group's social life. The baby is a new factor that's affecting everyone's experience. The author wasn't the one to bring up the issue but was part of the consensus. The main question is whether raising the issue was wrong.\n\nThe author's main concern is that the baby is causing disruptions, leading to less enjoyment. On the other hand, the couple's situation is that they have a baby, which is a significant life change. The wife was trying to join the games, which is a new development. The group's main reason for playing is to unwind, but the baby is making it harder.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? The author didn't act alone; it was a group consensus. The DMs brought it up. The author felt empathy for the wife's reaction and didn't want to suggest a babysitter due to financial constraints. The problem is whether the group overstepped by addressing the baby's presence directly.\n\nPossible angles: The group should have approached the issue more sensitively. Maybe they should have suggested solutions like a babysitter or alternative times instead of directly addressing the baby as an issue. However, the group did acknowledge the couple's financial situation and didn't push for that. The wife's reaction is also a factor\u2014maybe she felt excluded or misunderstood. The author's empathy is noted, showing they didn't want to hurt her feelings.\n\nAnother angle is that the group has a shared space and shared interests. The baby's presence is affecting everyone's enjoyment. It's reasonable to address it if it's impacting the group's primary activity. But the way it was communicated might have been harsh. The wife's response indicates she felt it was a personal attack. The author might not be in the wrong for participating in the group's decision, as it's a collective issue affecting all members.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The author wasn't the one to bring it up but was part of the group that formed the consensus. They tried to be empathetic. The answer might depend on whether the group's approach was reasonable. Since the main issue was the baby causing disruptions, and not the wife joining the game, the group's concern is valid. However, the way they communicated it might have been the problem. The author isn't directly in the wrong for being part of the group's decision but might have a responsibility to help mend the situation. The answer here could be B (not in the wrong) because the group had a legitimate concern, but the execution was poor.\n"
