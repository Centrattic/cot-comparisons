We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author of the D&D situation is in the wrong. Let me summarize the scenario again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe group plays D&D weekly at a host couple's house. They had a baby about a year ago, which has caused disruptions. The baby is mobile, noisy, and sometimes causes the parents to leave the game to attend to him. The author mentions that the group collectively felt it was affecting their enjoyment. The DMs eventually brought up the issue with the couple, and the wife reacted badly, feeling excluded. The author is now wondering if they're at fault.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious. So I need to assess if the author is wrong for bringing up the baby issue. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author says that the group came to a consensus that the baby was an issue. So it wasn't just the author's personal opinion. However, the author initially didn't want to bring it up themselves, waiting for the DMs to do so. The problem arose when the wife reacted strongly, feeling like she couldn't play anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here are: was it appropriate for the group to bring up the issue? Did they handle it in a considerate way? The author had empathy for the wife's feelings, but the issue was that the baby was impacting everyone's enjoyment. The group is adults with limited free time, so the game is important for them to unwind.\n\nBut the wife is a friend, and the baby's presence makes her participation difficult. The couple hosts the games, rearrange their home, and provide snacks. The baby's issues are causing stress. The author didn't suggest a solution like a babysitter due to the husband's job loss, which is a valid consideration.\n\nNow, is the author at fault? The author didn't raise the issue directly but was part of the group that felt it was a problem. However, the way the issue was brought up by the DMs led to the wife feeling excluded. The author might be in the wrong if they should have handled it differently, perhaps by addressing it more sensitively or finding a solution before confronting the couple. Alternatively, if the group collectively decided to raise the issue, maybe it's not the author's fault individually.\n\nBut the author did participate in discussing the problem and perhaps contributed to the group's decision to bring it up. The question is whether they had the right to do so. It's a balance between the group's needs and the couple's situation. The wife's reaction suggests that the way it was communicated was hurtful. The author might have been wrong in not ensuring that the couple was approached with more empathy and possible compromises before making a formal complaint.\n\nSo, considering that the group's action led to the wife's exclusion and emotional distress, maybe the author shares some responsibility. But since the group collectively felt it was an issue, maybe it's not entirely their fault. However, the author's role in not finding a solution first (like suggesting a babysitter despite the husband's job) might be a point against them. But they did consider the financial aspect. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. The main issue is whether the group overstepped by not being more considerate in their approach. The author's participation in the group's decision to raise the issue could mean they're not at fault, but perhaps they could have handled it better. However, the problem was the baby affecting their enjoyment, and it's reasonable to expect a solution. The answer might depend on whether the authors had a right to expect hosting duties to continue under the current circumstances. Since the couple hosts and it's their home, the group might need to be more flexible. But given that the game is important for the group's well-being, there's a balance here. \n\nIn the end, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault because the issue was valid and the group tried to address it, but the approach was flawed. The author might have been wrong in not addressing it more sensitively. But since the answer is binary, A or B, the key is whether the author is in the wrong. If the group's approach was harsh, then the author shares some blame. If the issue was legitimate and necessary to address, then they're not. But since the wife felt excluded and the author had empathy, maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong). Alternatively, if the group had a right to their enjoyment, maybe not. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because the way the issue was brought up hurt the wife, and the group should have considered solutions before criticizing the baby's impact. The author didn't take responsibility for the communication approach, even though they had empathy.\n"
