We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the D&D game issue is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple hosts the game nights, and they have a baby now. The baby is causing disruptions\u2014being loud, mobile, even leading to an ER visit. The author mentions that everyone agreed the baby was an issue, affecting their enjoyment. They tried dealing with it for months before one of the DMs brought it up. The wife took it badly, feeling excluded, and the author feels bad about it.\n\nSo, the author didn't bring up the issue themselves but is part of the group that collectively agreed it was a problem. They didn't suggest a solution like a babysitter because they know the couple's financial situation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author wasn't the one who directly approached the couple, but they were part of the group consensus. The DM did the talking. The author might feel they were in a difficult position, wanting their friend to stay but also not wanting the baby to ruin the game. They also empathize with the wife's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have considered the wife's perspective more. The wife wanted to participate, and the group's consensus to address the baby's impact might have made her feel excluded. The author's empathy is there, but perhaps they should have found a way to address the issue without making the wife feel like she can't play anymore. Maybe they could have suggested alternatives like a babysitter when possible, even if they didn't want to ask for money. Or maybe the group could have compromised, like shorter game sessions or specific times when the wife could join without the baby.\n\nBut the author did mention they tried dealing with it for months. The DM approached the couple, and the wife's reaction was harsh. The author's intention wasn't to exclude her, so maybe they aren't entirely at fault. However, the group's consensus leading up to the confrontation might have contributed to the wife's feelings. The author's participation in that consensus could be seen as part of the problem.\n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't the one who made the comment, but they were part of the group that agreed the baby was an issue. It's possible that the group's approach wasn't sensitive enough. The answer might depend on whether the author should have considered the wife's perspective even more and perhaps found a different solution before the confrontation. Since the author felt empathy and regret, maybe they aren't entirely in the wrong. But if the group's actions led to her feeling excluded, then maybe they share some responsibility. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the main confrontation was done by the DM, and the author was part of a group effort, but they might have had some role in the consensus. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is A if the group's actions were inappropriate.\n"
