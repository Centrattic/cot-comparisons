We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's causing disruptions during game nights. The author is part of the group and felt the baby was an issue but didn't bring it up directly, waiting for the DM to do so. The wife took it badly, left the chats, and the author is questioning their role.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The baby is causing disruptions: noise, needing attention which pauses the game, and even a trip to the ER. The group came to a consensus that it's a problem. The author didn't want to be the one to bring it up to the hosts, so they let the DM handle it. The wife's reaction was hurt, feeling like she can't play anymore, and the author is feeling responsible because they wanted her included as a friend.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The main issue here is communication. The author didn't raise the issue themselves but waited for the DM. But the group as a whole agreed it was a problem. The author's intention was good, not to hurt the wife, but to improve the group's experience. However, bringing up such a sensitive topic can be uncomfortable, and the way the DM approached it might have been too harsh. The author might feel they deferred to the DM, which is part of a group dynamic. But maybe the author should have addressed it earlier or in a more supportive way.\n\nThe author's decision not to suggest a babysitter because of the husband's job situation shows consideration, but the real problem is the baby's presence conflicting with the game. The wife's reaction is understandable because it's her child, and she might feel her family life is being criticized. The group's consensus doesn't absolve the author, but maybe it's a group issue, not just the author's fault.\n\nHowever, the author is part of the group that voiced the problem, even if they didn't speak up first. The question is whether the author shares responsibility for bringing up the issue in the first place. If the group as a whole felt it was a problem, then the author isn't necessarily wrong for being part of that group. But if the author didn't do enough to handle it sensitively, maybe they are. The answer hinges on whether the group's collective decision to address it is valid, and the author just followed along. \n\nIn the end, the author might not be in the wrong because they weren't the one to confront the hosts, but the group dynamic and how the issue was addressed could have been handled better. However, since the group came to a consensus, the author isn't solely responsible. The wife's reaction is more about how the issue was communicated, possibly the DM's approach, rather than the author's direct actions. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
