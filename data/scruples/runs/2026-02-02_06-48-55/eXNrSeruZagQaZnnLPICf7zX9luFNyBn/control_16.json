We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the D&D game situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the setup: a group of friends plays D&D weekly at a couple's house. The hosts have a baby now, which is causing issues during game nights. The baby is loud, disruptive, and even led to an ER visit once. The group discusses this, and a DM brings it up to the couple. The wife reacts badly, leaving the group chats and being upset. The author is feeling guilty because they wanted the wife to stay involved as a friend.\n\nSo, the author didn't bring up the issue themselves but was part of the consensus that the baby was a problem. The main question is whether they're in the wrong for being part of that discussion.\n\nHmm. The author's main concern is the enjoyment of the game nights. They mention that the game is a way for busy adults to unwind. The baby's presence is causing stress, not fun. But bringing up the issue might make the wife feel excluded, especially since she's a friend. The author didn't want to be the one to talk to the couple, so a DM did it instead. The wife's reaction was strong, and the author feels bad about it.\n\nIs the author at fault? Well, they were part of the group that recognized the problem and decided to address it. But maybe they should have approached it more sensitively. The wife might feel that her participation as a player is being questioned because of her role as a parent. The authors' empathy is there, but perhaps the way the issue was brought up could have been handled better. However, the problem wasn't just the author's idea; it was a group consensus. Also, the author didn't suggest a solution like a babysitter, which might have been a more constructive approach instead of stopping the wife from playing. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to address a problem that was affecting everyone. The group might have felt that the baby's presence was making the game less enjoyable, even though they value the couple's hospitality. The author's role here is more of a participant in the group's decision to talk to the couple. Since the DM was the one who actually broached the subject, the author might not be directly at fault. But they might share some responsibility for not considering alternative solutions or not approaching the couple in a more supportive way.\n\nI think the key points are: the group consensus was that the baby was an issue, the author wasn't the one to bring it up, but they felt empathy for the wife's reaction. The wife's reaction might be due to feeling blamed, but the group's concern is valid. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe the way the issue was handled could have been better. But according to the options given, the answer is either A or B. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author was part of the group that decided the baby was a problem and didn't take the lead in handling it better, but the actual confrontation was done by the DM, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, if the author should have thought of alternative solutions or handled it more carefully, maybe A. But the question is about being in the wrong. The author's intention was to address a shared issue, even if the outcome was negative. So probably the answer is B.\n"
