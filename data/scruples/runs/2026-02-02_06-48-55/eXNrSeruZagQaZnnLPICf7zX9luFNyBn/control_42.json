We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is at fault for bringing up the issue of the baby during their D&D game. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple hosts the game and had a baby, which is causing disruptions. The baby is loud, mobile, and even led to an emergency room visit once. The wife started playing, but the baby's presence makes it hard for her and others to enjoy the game. The author didn't bring up the issue directly but mentions that others agreed it was a problem. Eventually, a DM confronted the couple, and the wife reacted negatively, leaving the chats.\n\nThe author feels bad because they want their friend (the wife) to be included. They also don't want to suggest a babysitter due to the husband's job loss. The key points are whether the author is in the wrong for being part of the group that raised the issue and not stepping up themselves.\n\nNow, considering responsibility. Since the author was part of the group consensus that the baby was a problem, but didn't take the lead in discussing it with the hosts, maybe they share some responsibility. However, the author might not be the one who brought it up. The main issue here is that the author didn't act but others did. The wife's reaction suggests that the way the issue was raised was hurtful, but the author's role in the group consensus could make them feel complicit.\n\nBut the author also empathizes with the wife and didn't want to be the one to bring it up. They tried to avoid being the one to cause her distress. The problem is that the group as a whole decided the baby was an issue, so even if the author didn't speak up directly, they might have contributed to the problem by not addressing it in a more sensitive way.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't make the decision to bring it up; the DM did. The author's empathy and not wanting to suggest a babysitter shows they considered the couple's situation. So maybe the author is not at fault because they didn't act unilaterally and felt conflicted. But since they were part of the consensus, they might still be partially responsible for not finding a better solution.\n\nAlternatively, the main fault lies with the DM who brought it up in a way that hurt the wife. The author's role is more about participating in the problem but not being the one to escalate it. So the answer would depend on whether being part of the consensus is considered wrong. If the author didn't act but agreed with others, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if they should have taken a different approach, perhaps they are.\n\nHmm. The answer might be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because they didn't directly confront the hosts, but were part of a group decision. However, maybe they should have handled it more sensitively. But since the actual confrontation was done by the DM, the author's role is less direct. So B seems correct.\n"
