We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is part of a D&D group that meets weekly at a couple's home. The couple had a baby, and now the baby is causing issues during game nights. The baby is mobile, loud, distracting, and even caused an ER visit once. The wife started playing D&D, which was great, but now she has to leave the game to handle the baby, missing parts of the story and causing delays. The author mentions that the group agreed the baby was a problem, leading to stress instead of fun. The DM finally brought it up to the couple, and the wife was upset, removing herself from group chats and being angry. The author feels bad because they wanted her to be included and don't want to suggest a babysitter due to the couple's financial situation.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't bring up the issue themselves; the DM did. But the group as a whole came to the consensus that the baby was a problem. The author is feeling guilty because their friend (the wife) is upset. However, the author also empathizes with the group's need for a stress-free game night.\n\nFirst, the author isn't the one who directly communicated the problem to the couple. The DM did. But the author is part of a group that collectively agreed the baby was an issue. So even if the author didn't say it themselves, being part of the group that decided this is a problem could make them share some responsibility. But the author tried to avoid being the one to bring it up, which shows they were sensitive to the wife's feelings.\n\nThe couple's situation is hard\u2014financial issues, a new baby. The wife wanted to participate, but the baby made it impossible. The author is worried about being an ass for suggesting a babysitter, which is a valid concern. However, the group's decision to address the issue might have been necessary for their enjoyment. The author's intention was to maintain the group's fun, which is understandable, but it affected the wife negatively.\n\nIs the author wrong? They are part of a group that made a decision that led to a friend's upset. But they didn't act alone. The DM took the initiative. The author's guilt suggests they value the friend's feelings but also the group's needs. It's a tough balance. The author is not the one who directly communicated the problem, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, being part of the group that decided it was an issue could mean they share some fault. But the question is about the author specifically. Since they didn't act out of self-interest and tried to avoid being the one to say it, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but I'm a bit conflicted because the group's decision was collectively made, but the author's role in that decision could be seen as contributing. But the key is that the author didn't act alone, so they might not be in the wrong. So probably answer B.\n"
