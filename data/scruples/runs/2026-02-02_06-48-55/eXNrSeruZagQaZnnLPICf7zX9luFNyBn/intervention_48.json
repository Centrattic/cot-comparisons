We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a D&D game group that's been meeting at a couple's house. The hosts had a baby, which started causing some issues. The baby is a distraction, causing noise, and even led to an ER visit once. The group eventually brought up the issue to the hosts, leading to tension, especially with the wife.\n\nThe author says that everyone agreed the baby was a problem, but when the DM brought it up, the wife reacted strongly and left the group chats. The author feels bad about this and is asking if they're at fault. They mentioned not wanting to be the one to bring it up because they're not the DM, but others did.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault (A) or not (B). Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to address a problem that the group collectively found was affecting their enjoyment. They didn't want to be the one to bring it up, which shows they were trying to be considerate. The issue here is that the baby's presence was impacting the game's quality and the group's ability to unwind. The author isn't the one who raised the issue; the DM did. The author is part of a group consensus, so individual blame might not be fair.\n\nOn the other hand, the hosts are opening their home for the group, which is a big deal. The baby is part of their life now, and the group's decision to address it might have come off as dismissive or unappreciative of the hosts' efforts. The wife's reaction indicates she felt excluded or blamed, which is understandable. The author mentions empathy for her feelings but also the stress of their own time constraints.\n\nThe key points are: the group reached a consensus, the author wasn't the one who brought it up, and the hosts are facing their own challenges (husband unemployed, financial concerns). The author isn't suggesting a solution like a babysitter, which could be seen as insensitive. However, the problem was real, and not addressing it might have continued to affect everyone.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for being part of that group decision? Or is the issue more about how the DM handled the conversation with the hosts? The author might feel responsible because they were part of the group that felt the baby was an issue, but the actual confrontation was initiated by the DM. The author's role here is more of a participant in the concern rather than the one who acted.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because they were part of a group effort to address a shared problem. However, the way the issue was communicated to the hosts might have been handled better. But the author isn't the one who brought it up directly. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to check if being part of the group that raised the issue makes them at fault. Alternatively, since they tried to be considerate and the problem was real, they might be justified.\n"
