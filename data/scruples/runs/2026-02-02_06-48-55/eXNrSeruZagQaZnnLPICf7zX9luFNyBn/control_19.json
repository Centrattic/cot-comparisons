We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the D&D scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about game nights with friends where the hosts have a baby that's causing disruptions. The author mentions that the baby is a distraction, leading to missed parts of the game, and causing stress. They waited for someone else to bring it up, but when a DM did, the wife reacted strongly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The hosts are friends who provide space and snacks. The baby is a new addition, and the wife started playing. The main issue is that the baby's presence is affecting everyone's enjoyment. The author didn't directly confront the hosts but waited for the DM to do so. The wife's reaction was emotional, feeling excluded.\n\nNow, was the author in the wrong? Well, the author's intention was to address a problem that affected the group's enjoyment. They expressed empathy and tried to find a solution without being the one to bring it up. However, the way the issue was raised by the DM might have been too direct or poorly timed, leading to the wife's upset reaction.\n\nBut the author's role here was more about being part of the group consensus and not taking the lead. They didn't force the DM to bring it up, but they were part of the group that felt it was an issue. The key points are that the problem was real, the group was affected, and the author tried to handle it sensitively by letting the DM take charge. However, the outcome was a breakdown in communication and the wife's withdrawal.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, maybe the group could have handled the conversation more gently. The author might not be in the wrong because they were part of a collective concern and didn't act unilaterally. However, the way the issue was presented might have been too harsh, but the author isn't the one who raised it. The wife's reaction is also valid, showing that the approach might have been insensitive.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author had a valid reason to be concerned, tried to avoid personal confrontation, but the resolution caused harm. It's a tricky situation where both parties have valid points. But since the author was part of the group that felt the issue needed addressing and didn't act in a hostile way, they might not be in the wrong.\n"
