We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the D&D game situation is in the wrong. They provided the full story, so I need to analyze it carefully.\n\nFirst, the main issue is about a baby causing distractions during game nights. The hosts have a baby that's mobile, loud, and even caused an emergency room visit once. The group tried dealing with it but then the DM brought up the issue to the couple. The wife reacted strongly and left the group chats, feeling excluded. The author is questioning if they're at fault for being part of the group that raised the baby's impact on the game.\n\nThe author isn't the DM; they let the DM handle the conversation. They mention that everyone in the group agreed the baby was causing problems. They also feel empathy for the wife and are worried about suggesting a babysitter because the husband just lost his job. The key points here are that the problem was a collective issue, not just the author's decision. The author didn't take the lead but supported the group's consensus. The wife's reaction was to the DM's approach, not directly to the author. \n\nBut the author is feeling guilty because they wanted her to be included. However, the group's overall enjoyment was affected, and they needed to address the distraction. The author didn't force the issue but was part of a group that collectively decided there was a problem. It's a tough situation where personal needs (game nights) and family responsibilities (baby care) clash. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't act alone, and the problem was acknowledged by everyone. The author's intention was to maintain the group's fun, which is reasonable. The wife's reaction is more about how the DM approached it rather than the author's role. So, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong. They were part of a group decision and tried to avoid being the one to bring it up. They also considered the financial situation of the hosts. The main conflict is between the group's needs and the hosts' personal circumstances, but the author isn't solely responsible.\n"
