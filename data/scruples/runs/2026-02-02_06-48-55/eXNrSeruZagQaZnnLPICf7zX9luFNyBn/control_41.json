We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's becoming a distraction during game nights. The author (AITA) told the hosts that their baby is an issue, which led to tension, especially with the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The group has been meeting for three years at the hosts' home. The hosts go out of their way to rearrange their basement and provide snacks. The baby is a new addition, and it's causing problems: being loud, a distraction, even leading to an ER visit. The group collectively feels it's affecting their enjoyment, and the DMs brought it up, but the wife reacted negatively.\n\nNow, the key points: The author wasn't the DM, so they didn't bring it up themselves. However, they admit that everyone agreed the baby was an issue. They felt bad because the wife is a friend and might be excluded. They also don't want to suggest a babysitter because of financial issues (husband lost his job).\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is that they contributed to the group's consensus that the baby was a problem. But did they have a right to voice that concern? Or was it better to let it go for the sake of the host's situation?\n\nOn one hand, the group's game nights are important for their relaxation. If the baby is making the sessions stressful, it's reasonable to address it. On the other hand, the hosts are friends, and bringing up the baby's issues could be seen as insensitive or harsh, especially considering the wife's feelings and the financial situation.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because they were part of a group consensus and tried to maintain the fun of the games. However, perhaps they should have approached the issue more sensitively, maybe by suggesting a solution like a babysitter (even if they couldn't afford it) or adjusting the game time. Alternatively, maybe they shouldn't have let the issue fester without addressing it early on.\n\nBut the author did express empathy and tried to avoid being the one to bring it up. They felt bad about the wife's reaction. The main problem might be that the wife took it personally, interpreting it as a problem with her as a parent rather than the situation. The author might have done the right thing by voicing a shared concern, even if it caused hurt feelings. However, the way it was communicated could have been a factor.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the group's concerns were valid and if the author's participation in discussing it was reasonable. Since everyone agreed and the hosts were aware, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the way they presented it was unkind or without offering support, that's different. The author seems to have tried to be considerate, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. So, answer B.\n"
