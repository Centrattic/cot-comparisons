We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong (AITA) for bringing up the issue of the baby during their D&D game nights. \n\nFirst, the setup: They've been part of a D&D group for three years, hosted by a married couple. The couple's baby is causing disruptions\u2014being loud, distracting, even leading to an ER visit. The group feels it's affecting their enjoyment. The author didn't bring it up initially but was part of the consensus. The DM eventually did, and the wife reacted negatively, pulling out of the group.\n\nNow, considering the situation. The key points are: The baby is a distraction, causing stress. The group collectively felt it was an issue. The author didn't bring it up directly but was part of the group that agreed. The DM did, and the wife took it personally, feeling excluded. \n\nThe author's concern is whether they're at fault. The question is whether the group's action was justified. The baby's presence is affecting the adults' ability to enjoy their game. They are adults with limited time to unwind. The hosts are trying to accommodate the group, but the baby's age makes it hard to control. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife felt her participation was being taken away. She had just started playing. The author feels empathy and doesn't want to suggest a babysitter due to the husband's job loss. \n\nSo, the dilemma is between the right to a distraction-free game and the wife's right to participate. The group's consensus was it was an issue, so maybe it's a valid concern. But bringing it up caused tension. The author didn't act directly but was part of the group that felt it was a problem. \n\nBut the author didn't confront the hosts themselves. They waited for the DM to do it. The wife's reaction was harsh, maybe overly sensitive, but the author is concerned about being in the wrong. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the key is whether the action was reasonable given the circumstances. The group's enjoyment is important, especially since it's a social activity they use to unwind. However, the hosts are also friends and have a baby. The baby is part of their life now. The author and group may have a right to voice their concerns, but the way it was handled (through the DM) and the wife's reaction complicates it. \n\nThe author didn't directly cause the problem but was part of the group that felt it was an issue. The answer might hinge on whether the group's actions were reasonable, not the individual's. Since the author didn't bring it up, maybe they're not the main wrongdoer. However, being part of the consensus that led to the DM bringing it up could make them share some blame. \n\nAlternatively, the author might not be at fault because the baby's presence was genuinely disruptive. The group needed to address it. The problem is how the DM communicated it, not necessarily the author. The author's role was more passive. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), because the issue was valid and the author didn't act out of malice. The problem was the way the DM approached it, not the author's direct actions.\n"
