We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D group where the hosts (a married couple) had a baby, and the baby's presence is causing disruptions during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is loud, a distraction, leads to interruptions, and caused some stress. They waited for a DM to bring up the issue, but when it was addressed, the wife reacted strongly and is now upset. The author feels bad because the wife, who is a friend, can't participate anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The hosts are already providing a lot for the group: hosting, rearranging their home, supplying game stuff and snacks. The baby is a new challenge. The author, like others, finds the baby disruptive. But the problem was addressed by the DM, not the author. The wife's reaction seems extreme, but the author is empathizing with her. Also, the author isn't suggesting a solution like a babysitter due to the husband's unemployment.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is concerned about group enjoyment and communication. They didn't act alone but waited for the DM to address it. However, the wife's feelings were hurt, and the author feels responsible. But is the author wrong? They had valid reasons for the group's discomfort, and it's not their fault the wife took it personally. Also, the author tried to be considerate by not suggesting a costly solution. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they communicated a legitimate issue through the appropriate channel. But maybe the wife's reaction is more about feeling excluded rather than the author's actions. It's a sensitive situation, but the author's intentions were to improve the group's experience, which is valid. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
