We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling the hosts that their baby is causing issues during their D&D game nights.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple hosts the game, they have a baby now. The baby is disruptive\u2014noisy, causing interruptions, even leading to an ER trip once. The group, including the author, felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment. The author wasn't the DM, so they didn't bring it up directly. Another DM did, and the wife reacted badly, now upset and removed from group chats.\n\nThe author feels bad because they care about the wife as a friend and don't want her excluded. They also don't think suggesting a babysitter is feasible due to financial issues. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions. They were part of a consensus that the baby was an issue and agreed to bring it up. They tried to be considerate by not being the one to raise it directly. However, the wife took it personally, feeling excluded. The author's intention wasn't to exclude her but to address the group's experience.\n\nBut is it the author's fault? They were part of the group that felt the baby was causing problems. They didn't act alone; the DM actually brought it up. The author might feel guilty, but the problem here is about whether they were wrong. Since they tried to handle it sensitively, maybe not. However, the main issue is whether the group's approach was fair. The couple allows the game in their home; the baby is part of their life. The group's needs vs. the hosts' situation.\n\nBut the wife left the game, which might have been her choice. The author's role was to express the group's concerns, which they did through the DM. The problem is that the wife felt excluded. The author might be in the wrong if the way the issue was raised was hurtful. But the story says they didn't want to be the one to bring it up, showing they were cautious. Also, they considered the financial aspect of a babysitter, so they were trying to be empathetic.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the group should have handled it more gently, perhaps suggesting solutions like a babysitter if possible. But the husband's job loss complicates that. The author's position is that the group's experience is important, but they also care about the friend. It's a tough spot. The author isn't the one who directly brought up the issue, so maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the group's approach was to exclude the wife, that's a problem. However, the DM was the one who actually raised the concern, so the author's role was more of being part of the consensus. \n\nIn conclusion, the author tried to be considerate, but the outcome was hurtful. However, since they were part of the group's consensus and didn't act alone, maybe they're not in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they were trying to address a group issue while being empathetic.\n"
