We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D game group hosted by a couple who had a baby, which is causing issues during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is a distraction, leading to interruptions and stress. They didn't bring it up themselves but others did, and now the wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the group dynamics. The hosts went out of their way to host, which is appreciated. The baby's presence affects the game experience. The group collectively felt it was an issue, not just the author. The author didn't want to be the one to approach the hosts, so another DM did. But the wife reacted strongly, feeling excluded now.\n\nThe key points are: the group consensus was that the baby was a problem. The author tried to avoid being the one to bring it up, which is understandable, especially since the wife is a friend. The wife's reaction was emotional, but the group did address it. The author feels bad but it seems the issue was a shared concern.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't directly cause the problem, just voiced the group's concerns. Since the group agreed, it's more about how the issue was handled. Maybe the approach could have been more sensitive, but the author didn't act alone. The hosts might need to find a solution, like a babysitter if possible, but the author isn't necessarily at fault for pointing out a problem that affects everyone. Therefore, answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
