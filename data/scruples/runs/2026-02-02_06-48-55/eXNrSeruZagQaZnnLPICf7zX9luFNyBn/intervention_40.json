We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the D&D situation is in the wrong. The story is about a group that meets weekly for D&D, hosted by a couple. After the couple had a baby, the baby became a distraction, leading to interruptions during game nights. The author, along with others, agreed the baby was an issue. The DM brought it up to the couple, the wife was upset, and now they're wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple hosts the game, go out of their way to prepare the space, provide snacks, etc. The baby is causing disruptions\u2014noises, needing attention, even an ER visit. The group felt stressed, and the wife stopped participating. The author feels bad, especially since the wife is a friend. They don't want to suggest a babysitter due to financial issues of the husband.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the group's enjoyment is important; they use the game nights to unwind. On the other hand, bringing up the baby issue might have made the wife feel excluded. The DM brought it up, not the author, but the author agreed with the sentiment.\n\nPossible angles: Did the group handle it the right way? Maybe they should have discussed it privately first? The author might not be in the wrong because the issue was real and affecting everyone. However, the way it was communicated could have been better. The wife's reaction suggests she felt attacked. Maybe there's a middle ground, like suggesting solutions (like a babysitter if possible) instead of just pointing out the problem. But the author considered the financial situation, so that's a factor.\n\nIs it the author's fault for agreeing with the issue? They didn't confront the couple directly, but they were part of the consensus. The main issue is the DM bringing it up, so maybe the author isn't the one who initiated the confrontation. But the author's role in agreeing to the problem could contribute. The question is whether expressing a concern is wrong when it's affecting the group's experience.\n\nIn similar situations, like group activities where a child causes disruptions, it's a common issue. The key is communication and finding a solution together. If the group didn't approach it sensitively, they might have made the couple feel blamed. The author might not be in the wrong for acknowledging the issue, but perhaps the approach was flawed.\n\nSo the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the author expressed a valid concern that was shared by the group, and they didn't directly confront the couple. The main issue was how the DM brought it up, not the author's agreement. The author's empathy and consideration for the wife's feelings show they weren't malicious.\n"
