We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's causing distractions during their game nights. The author and others in the group felt that the baby was affecting their enjoyment, leading to interruptions and stress. They eventually brought up the issue, but the wife was upset and left the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The hosts have been doing a lot for the group by hosting the games, providing snacks, and setting up their basement. The baby's presence is causing problems, but the hosts might be in a tough spot financially since the husband lost his job. The author mentions that everyone agreed the baby was an issue, but they didn't want to be the one to bring it up, so one of the DMs did. The wife reacted strongly, feeling excluded now.\n\nThe author's main concern is whether they did something wrong by contributing to the discussion or by not suggesting a babysitter. They feel empathy for the wife because she wanted to participate in the games after joining. But they also think the baby is making the game less enjoyable for everyone else.\n\nI should weigh the group's right to have a good experience versus the hosts' (especially the wife's) ability to join in. Game nights are a way for them to unwind, and if the baby is causing stress, maybe the group needs to address it. However, the way the issue was brought up might have been hurtful. The author didn't directly confront the hosts but waited for someone else to do it. But the wife's reaction was harsh, maybe feeling like she was being blamed for the baby's behavior.\n\nIs the author at fault? They were part of the consensus but didn't take the lead. They also didn't suggest alternatives like a babysitter, which could have been a more supportive approach. The wife might have felt that the group is prioritizing their fun over her and her baby's needs. The author might not be in the wrong for voicing the group's concerns, but perhaps they could have handled it more sensitively. However, since the DM did bring it up, the author's role might be less direct. The key is whether the group had a right to address the issue and how they did it. If they approached it with empathy and offered solutions, maybe it's less their fault. But if they just complained without understanding the hosts' situation, then maybe the author is at fault. The author seems to express empathy, so maybe they're not entirely wrong. But the outcome was that the wife left, so there's a conflict. The answer depends on balancing both sides.\n"
