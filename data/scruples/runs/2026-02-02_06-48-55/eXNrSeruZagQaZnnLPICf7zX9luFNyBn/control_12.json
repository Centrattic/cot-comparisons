We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a D&D game group that's been meeting at a couple's house for three years. The couple had a baby a year ago, and the baby is causing disruptions during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is loud, a distraction, and even led to an ER visit once. The group discussed the issue and the DM brought it up to the couple, but the wife took it badly, feeling excluded, and now she's upset and left the group chats.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is the baby's impact on the game. The author isn't the DM but did support when the DM brought it up. The wife left the group, which is a big consequence. The author is feeling bad because they care about the wife's feelings.\n\nThe author's actions: They were part of a group consensus that the baby was causing issues. They didn't raise it themselves but supported the DM who did. They also mention understanding the wife's perspective and feeling empathy. They don't want to suggest a babysitter because of the husband's job loss, which adds to the financial strain.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the group collectively came to the conclusion that the baby was a problem. The author wasn't the one to bring it up directly, they supported the DM's action. The wife's reaction is extreme, but the author didn't force her to stop playing; the couple might have made that decision. The author is taking responsibility for the outcome emotionally, which shows they care.\n\nPossible angles: Did the group handle this inconsiderately? But the author and others tried to deal with it for months. The problem affected everyone's enjoyment. The wife's reaction might be more about feeling blamed rather than the baby's presence itself. The author isn't the one who initiated the conversation but backed it up. Also, suggesting a babysitter was considered, but they didn't push for it because they know the couple's financial situation.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the couple could have found a solution without removing the wife from the group. The wife might feel that her ability to participate with her baby is being criticized, which is a valid parent concern. But the group needed to address the disruptions affecting all members.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's about whether the person's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The author's main action was supporting a necessary change to preserve the group's enjoyment. While the outcome was hurt feelings, the author's intention wasn't malicious. They tried to balance the group's needs with the couple's situation. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong), because they were part of a group decision and supported a necessary change, albeit with some unintended consequences.\n"
