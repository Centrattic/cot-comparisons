We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the user wants to know if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group that meets at a couple's house, but the baby is causing disruptions. The author says they told the hosts that the baby is an issue, which led to the wife being upset and leaving the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The hosts are friends and have been hosting for three years. They went out of their way to rearrange their home for the group. Then they had a baby, which introduced new challenges. The baby is causing distractions, leading to interruptions during game nights. The group, including the DMs, discussed it and approached the couple, but the wife took it badly. The author is empathetic but feels they might have contributed to the problem.\n\nThe key points are whether the group addressed the issue appropriately. The author mentions that everyone agreed the baby was a problem. So the problem isn't just the author's opinion but a consensus. However, the way they brought it up might have been hurtful. The wife felt excluded and left the chats. The author is concerned about suggesting a babysitter due to financial issues of the husband.\n\nI need to think about if the group should have handled it differently. Maybe they should have first tried to find solutions together, like suggesting a babysitter, adjusting times, or moving the game elsewhere. Instead, directly pointing out the baby as an issue without offering alternatives might have come off as harsh. The wife's emotional reaction suggests she felt blamed, which is understandable. The author's intention was to address the problem for everyone's enjoyment, but the approach might have been too direct without considering the hosts' situation.\n\nAnother angle: the group is made up of adults who need to unwind. The baby's presence is affecting their experience. However, the hosts are also dealing with a new baby and career changes. There's a balance between group needs and personal circumstances. The author might not be entirely at fault because the issue was a group consensus, but the execution of bringing it up could have been more sensitive.\n\nAlso, the author wasn't the DM, so maybe they had less authority to bring it up. The DMs did address it, but the way it was handled led to conflict. The author's empathy is clear, but their role in the situation might mean they share some responsibility for not facilitating a more constructive conversation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer isn't straightforward. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the approach was abrupt and didn't consider alternatives, maybe the author is partially at fault. However, if the issue was a group consensus and they were just part of a larger decision, the fault might be shared. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the scenario. The answer might be A (Yes) because the way the issue was raised led to the wife's exclusion and emotional distress, which could have been mitigated with a different approach.\n"
