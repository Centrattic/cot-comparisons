We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's causing issues during game nights. The OP, who isn't the DM, mentioned the baby as a problem to the hosts. Now the wife is upset and left the group chats.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The group meets weekly, and the hosts provide space and game materials. The baby is causing distractions, leading to missed parts of the game, and even an ER visit. The OP waited until the DM brought it up, and after that, the wife reacted strongly, feeling excluded. The OP feels bad because they care about the wife as a friend.\n\nSo, the question is whether the group was right to point out the baby's impact. On one hand, game nights are important for their relaxation, and the baby's presence is affecting everyone's experience. On the other hand, the wife is a friend, and the hosts might feel their child is being criticized. \n\nThe OP didn't suggest alternatives like a babysitter, which could be a sensitive issue given the husband's job loss. The group consensus was the baby was an issue, so maybe the problem wasn't just the OP's words. However, bringing it up directly might have been handled more delicately. But considering the impact on the game and that the DM eventually raised it, maybe the OP isn't entirely at fault. They tried to address it without being the DM, which shows they were trying to be respectful.\n\nI think the OP isn't in the wrong because the issues were real and affecting everyone. The problem might be more about how the feedback was delivered, but since the DM was the one to bring it up first, the OP isn't solely to blame. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
