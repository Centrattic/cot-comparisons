We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the D&D scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D group whose hosts have a baby that's causing disruptions during game nights. The author of the post is questioning if they're at fault for discussing the baby issue with the hosts, leading to the wife being upset and leaving the game.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The hosts have been hosting the games for three years, providing space and snacks. When they had a baby, the baby's behavior became a distraction, causing the game to stall and even an ER visit. The group, including the DMs, eventually brought up the issue. The author says that the group collectively felt the baby was a problem, and they wanted to address it. The wife took it badly, feeling excluded now that she can't play as much. The author feels bad for her and doesn't want to suggest a babysitter due to the husband's job loss.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but they're asking for my opinion. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The hosts opened their home for the group, and the baby is a new variable. The group's primary purpose is to have fun and unwind. The baby's presence is affecting the game's enjoyment. The author points out that the issue was brought up by one of the DMs, not them. The author's role was to voice their concerns as part of the group consensus. \n\nBut the wife's reaction is significant. She's a friend, and the author wants her to be included. The problem is whether the way the issue was raised was appropriate. The group might have felt that the baby was impacting everyone's experience, but the hosts might see it as disrespectful, especially since the wife is trying to balance being a parent and a player.\n\nPossible angles: Was the group's approach considerate? Did they consider alternatives like a babysitter but found it impossible due to financial constraints? The author mentions not wanting to suggest a babysitter because the husband lost his job. However, maybe the group didn't explore all options before confronting the hosts. \n\nAnother point: The author isn't the DM, but the issue was brought up by the DMs. The author is part of the group that collectively felt the baby was a problem. So it's possible that the DMs took the lead, but the author was part of the consensus. The wife's reaction suggests that the way the issue was presented was hurtful. The author might be caught between wanting to maintain group dynamics and respecting the hosts' circumstances.\n\nThe question is whether bringing up the issue was necessary or if there were better ways to handle it. The author might be in the wrong if the group didn't approach the hosts with empathy, considering their situation as new parents. Alternatively, the group has a right to expect a conducive environment for their activity, which the baby is disrupting.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, it's often better to address issues privately and respectfully. The fact that the wife felt excluded and removed herself from the group indicates that the communication was not handled well. The author's empathy for the wife suggests they recognize the sensitivity of the situation. However, the group's need for a distraction-free environment is also valid.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? If the group collectively decided to address the issue and the author was part of that, but the approach was harsh or insensitive, then maybe they share some responsibility. However, if the DMs were the ones who brought it up, perhaps the author isn't directly at fault. The key is whether the group's approach was considerate of the hosts' circumstances and if they tried all possible solutions before confronting.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for voicing the issue as part of the group's consensus, but the way the DMs brought it up might have been the problem. However, the author's participation in the group's decision to address the issue could share some blame, especially if they didn't consider the hosts' perspective adequately. But given the information, the main fault might lie with the DMs, not the author. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
