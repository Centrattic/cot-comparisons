We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D game group where the hosts have a baby that's causing disruptions. The author is part of the group and says that the baby becomes a problem, leading to the wife being upset and leaving the chats.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The hosts opened their home for games for three years. After the baby was born, the baby is mobile, loud, and causes distractions. The group discussed it, and the DMs approached the couple. The wife reacted negatively, feeling excluded. The author feels bad because they value her as a friend.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't bring up the issue directly but was part of the group consensus. They tried to avoid being the one to bring it up, letting the DMs handle it. The author's main concern is that the baby is affecting everyone's enjoyment, especially given they're busy adults using game nights to unwind.\n\nPossible angles: Did the author have a right to voice the concerns since it's affecting the group's experience? Or were they wrong to contribute to a situation that made the wife feel excluded? The author didn't suggest a solution like a babysitter, which might have been a better approach. Also, the author empathizes with the wife's feelings but still wanted to address the issue.\n\nAnother point: the author wasn't the one to bring it up, but was part of the consensus. The problem was already discussed among the group. Maybe the fault isn't on the author but on the DMs for how they presented it. However, the author's participation in the group's decision to discuss the baby's impact could be seen as contributing.\n\nBut the author's intention was to address the issue to preserve the game's quality. They might have thought the husband and wife would understand. However, the wife's reaction shows that the approach was hurtful. The author might have failed to consider the wife's perspective enough, leading to her feeling excluded.\n\nIn AITA situations, the key is whether the action was reasonable and respectful. The author tried to address a valid problem but perhaps didn't handle it sensitively. The fact that they felt the need to post about it shows they're concerned about their actions. However, the main issue was brought up by the DMs, not the author. The author's role was more of a participant in the group's consensus rather than the one who initiated the problem.\n\nConsidering all that, the author might not be the one at fault. The main issue is that the couple's baby is causing disruptions, and the group's attempt to address it led to the wife's distress. The author's participation in the group's decision isn't necessarily wrong, but maybe the way the problem was communicated was the issue. However, since the author didn't directly confront the couple and instead let the DMs handle it, they might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
