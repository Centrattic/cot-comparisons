We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D game group where the hosts have a baby that's causing issues. The author didn't bring up the issue themselves because they didn't want to be the one to say something, but others did, leading to the wife being upset and leaving the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The hosts provide the space and snacks, which is a big deal. The baby's behavior is affecting the game\u2014making noise, causing interruptions, even an ER visit. The author mentions that everyone agreed the baby was an issue, but the DMs brought it up, not the author. The wife reacted strongly, feeling excluded, and the author feels bad about it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling the hosts. The author didn't directly confront the hosts but was part of a group that collectively felt the baby was a problem. The DMs brought it up, and the author didn't. The author might feel guilty because their friend (the wife) is upset. \n\nOn one hand, the author didn't initiate the conversation, which could be seen as not contributing to the conflict. But on the other hand, they were aware of the problem and didn't act. However, the group consensus was that the baby was an issue, so maybe it wasn't just the author's decision. The DMs brought it up, so maybe the author isn't solely responsible. The wife's reaction was maybe more about the DMs bringing it up rather than the group's feelings. \n\nThe author also considered suggesting a babysitter but felt it wasn't feasible. The key here is whether the author did something wrong. Since they didn't bring up the issue themselves, but others did, maybe the blame isn't on them. They were part of a group that felt the problem existed. The author's main guilt is that their friend is upset, but maybe that's unavoidable when there's a conflict. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because they didn't act alone and tried to avoid being the one to bring it up, possibly to be respectful. The problem was already there, and the DMs brought it up regardless. The author's empathy is valid, but it's a tough situation. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
