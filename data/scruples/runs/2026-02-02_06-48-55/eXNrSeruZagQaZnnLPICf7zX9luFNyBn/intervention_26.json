We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D game hosted at a couple's home, and the baby is causing issues. The author and others felt the baby was a distraction, leading to them bringing the issue up. The wife took it badly and left the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been hosting for three years, rearranging their home and providing snacks. The husband lost his job recently, so suggesting a babysitter might not be feasible. The baby is mobile, loud, and caused ER visits. The group tried dealing with it for months before bringing it up. The author mentions that everyone agreed it was an issue affecting their enjoyment. The DM brought it up, and the wife reacted strongly, feeling excluded.\n\nNow, the author's perspective is that they wanted to address the problem but feel bad for the wife. They're not the DM, so they didn't bring it up themselves. However, the group consensus was the baby was a problem. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being part of the group that raised the issue.\n\nPossible angles: Was the way the issue was raised appropriate? Were there alternatives considered, like a babysitter or rescheduling? The author didn't suggest a babysitter because they know the husband's financial situation. But maybe they could have offered to help with costs or found another solution. Also, the wife's inclusion in the game is important. The group might have felt it was necessary to address the distraction, but the way it was communicated might have been hurtful.\n\nThe author's empathy is noted, but the main question is whether the group was justified in bringing up the issue. Since it's affecting their mental health (headaches, stress), maybe they have a valid point. However, the wife's reaction suggests it was a sensitive topic. The author might not be in the wrong for supporting the group's decision, but could have handled it more delicately. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The author didn't act alone; the DM brought it up. The author's role was more of a participant in the consensus. So maybe they're not in the wrong, but the answer depends on whether the group's action was justified despite the wife's feelings.\n\nI think the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the group had a legitimate issue, but maybe there's a middle ground. However, the AITA format often considers the impact on others. The wife's exclusion is significant. So perhaps A (in the wrong), as the group might have handled it poorly. But the user initially thought the author was in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
