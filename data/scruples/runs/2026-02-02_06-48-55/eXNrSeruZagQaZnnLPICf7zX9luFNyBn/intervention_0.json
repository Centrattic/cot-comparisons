We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D game group where the hosts have a baby that's becoming a distraction. The author didn't bring it up themselves but others did, and now the wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The group has been meeting for three years at the hosts' home. The hosts put in a lot of effort, rearranging their basement, providing snacks, etc. Then the hosts have a baby, which becomes a problem during game nights. The baby is mobile, noisy, and even led to an ER visit once. The group consensus is it's an issue, but the author didn't want to bring it up because they didn't want to hurt the wife's feelings, especially since she's a friend and started playing. The DMs eventually brought it up, and the wife took it badly, removing herself from the group.\n\nThe author is feeling guilty because they wanted the wife to be included. They also don't want to suggest a babysitter due to the husband's job loss. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not bringing it up before the DMs did.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they were trying to balance the group's enjoyment with their friend's situation. They didn't want to be the one to start a difficult conversation. But others came to the consensus that the baby was a problem, so maybe the author thought it was a shared issue, not just their personal problem. The problem is that the way it was handled, the wife felt excluded and left.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, maybe they should have found a way to address the issue more sensitively. They didn't want to be the one to bring it up, but perhaps they could have discussed it privately with the hosts first or suggested a solution like a babysitter, even though they didn't want to pressure the hosts. But the author is empathetic and tried to avoid conflict, which is understandable. However, by not speaking up, maybe the group's issues continued until it was worse, leading to the wife's upset reaction. \n\nBut the author isn't the one who brought it up; the DMs did. So maybe the author isn't the main issue here. The real problem might be that the DMs didn't handle the conversation carefully enough, leading to the wife's emotional reaction. The author's role was not to be the one to bring it up, but they might have felt conflicted about it. \n\nAlternatively, the group's consensus that the baby was a problem might have led to the DMs feeling they had to act. The author's hesitation could be seen as not taking responsibility, but they were trying to be kind. It's a tough spot. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the author is asking if they are the one being an ass. The key factors here are whether the author's inaction contributed to the problem. Since the author didn't bring it up, but others did, perhaps the author isn't the one in the wrong. The main issue is the way the problem was communicated to the hosts. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I need to be careful. The author might think they should have done more, but the situation was complex. The hosts were making sacrifices, and the baby is part of their life. The group's game is important, but so is the hosts' ability to participate with their new child. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they tried to avoid conflict and it was the DMs who actually raised the issue. The author's intention was to support the wife and the group. So the answer might be B.\n"
