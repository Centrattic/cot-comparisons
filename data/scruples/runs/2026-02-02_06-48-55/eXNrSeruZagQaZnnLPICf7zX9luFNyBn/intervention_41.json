We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an answer between A and B.\n\nThe situation is about a D&D group that's been meeting at a couple's house. The couple has a baby now, which is causing some issues during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is a distraction\u2014mobile, loud, leading to interruptions and even a trip to the ER once. The author and others felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment. They tried dealing with it for a few months, then one of the DMs brought it up to the couple. The wife reacted strongly, saying she can't play anymore, and has distanced herself. The author feels bad because they care about the wife as a friend.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the group met at the couple's home for three years. The couple put effort into hosting, rearranging the basement, providing snacks, etc. The baby's presence is causing disruptions. The author says that everyone agreed the baby was an issue. However, when the DM brought it up, the wife took it badly, leading to her withdrawal from the group.\n\nThe author's role was to be part of the group and express the issue, but they didn't want to be the one to bring it up, so the DM did. The author feels guilty because they wanted the wife to be included. The author also mentions not wanting to suggest a babysitter due to the husband's job loss.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points are whether they had a right to voice the issue, considering the group's consensus, and whether their approach was appropriate. The problem is that the wife felt excluded, leading to her leaving. The author and others felt the game nights were supposed to be their time to unwind, which is being affected.\n\nBut maybe the issue is that the group didn't approach the couple in a more sensitive way. The author didn't want to be the one to bring it up, but it was necessary. However, the wife's reaction suggests that the way the issue was communicated might have been hurtful. The author might not be in the wrong because the group collectively decided it was an issue. But on the other hand, maybe they should have considered alternatives before bringing it up, like suggesting a babysitter or adjusting game times.\n\nBut the author explicitly states that the group came to a consensus. They also considered not suggesting a babysitter because they knew the couple's financial situation. So perhaps they tried to approach it sensitively. However, the way the DM presented it might have been the problem. The author might not be at fault for expressing a collective concern, but perhaps the execution was flawed. However, the question is about the author specifically. Since the author was part of the group that felt the baby was an issue and didn't act as the one to bring it up, but was part of the consensus, maybe they're not wrong. Alternatively, maybe the author should have been more proactive in finding a solution that's less hurtful, but they tried.\n\nThe main question is whether the group had a right to voice their concerns. The couple's home is being used, so the group has a right to express how their experience is affected. However, the wife's emotional response and withdrawal indicate that the approach was not handled well. The author might not be in the wrong for voicing a collective opinion, but maybe the group should have handled the discussion more sensitively. Since the author didn't bring it up themselves, but it was the DM, and they felt empathy, perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they were part of a group that had to address a real issue affecting their game nights, even if the outcome was negative. The fault might lie more with how the DM presented it, not the author specifically.\n"
