We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group that's been meeting at a couple's house for three years. The couple had a baby, which became a distraction during game nights. The author and others felt the baby was affecting everyone's enjoyment, so they brought it up to the hosts. The wife was upset and left the group chats.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The hosts are opening their home, which is a big deal. They went out of their way to make the space work for the group. The baby's presence is causing disruptions\u2014noise, needing attention, even an ER visit. The group of adults is using game nights to unwind, which is important for them. The author mentions that the baby is making the games stressful instead of fun, and that everyone agreed it's an issue. \n\nBut the key point is how the issue was addressed. The author didn't want to be the one to bring it up, so another DM did. The wife took it poorly, feeling excluded. The author feels bad because they wanted the wife to be included. They also mention not wanting to suggest a babysitter because of the husband's financial situation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, the group's enjoyment is important, and they have a valid concern about the baby being a distraction. On the other hand, the way the issue was handled might have been insensitive. The wife is a friend and part of the group, and the hosts are providing a service by hosting. The group's needs shouldn't override the hosts' personal situation without considering alternatives. \n\nThe author didn't bring up the issue themselves, which might have been harsher. But the DM who did bring it up might have done so without empathy, leading to the wife's reaction. The author is empathetic but feels guilty. The question is whether they're at fault. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, communication is key. Maybe the group should have discussed options first, like suggesting a babysitter if possible, or adjusting game times. But the author didn't want to suggest a babysitter due to costs. However, maybe they could have approached the hosts to see if there's a way to manage the baby's presence without making the wife feel excluded. The hosts might be able to find a way to accommodate both the baby and the games.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They didn't directly cause the problem, but they were part of a group that voiced concerns without considering the hosts' feelings adequately. The author might not be at fault for voicing a shared concern, but the manner in which it was handled could be improved. However, since the author wasn't the one to bring it up, maybe they aren't the main issue. The DM who brought it up might be more at fault. But the user is asking about the author's position. \n\nHmm. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the group's experience is valid, and they had a right to express their concerns. However, the way it was handled was problematic, but the author didn't initiate the conversation. The author is empathetic and feels guilty, which suggests they aren't malicious. The main issue is that the group didn't approach the hosts more sensitively. The author isn't in the wrong for voicing a shared concern, but the group's approach was flawed. So the answer might be B.\n"
