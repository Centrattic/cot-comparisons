We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the D&D situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the hosts of their game nights have a baby now, and the baby is causing distractions during the games. The author mentions that the baby is loud, mobile, and even caused an emergency room visit once. The group agreed it was an issue, and one of the DMs brought it up to the couple. The wife was upset and stopped participating. The author feels bad but is unsure if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The hosts are providing space and resources for the group's game nights. The baby is a new variable that's affecting everyone's experience. The author is part of the group but isn't the DM, so they didn't initiate the conversation. The problem was raised by the DMs, and the wife reacted strongly. The author is worried about being in the wrong but also empathizes with the wife's feelings.\n\nSo, are the author in the wrong? Well, the author didn't bring up the issue themselves. They felt it was a group problem and that others had the lead. The DMs did address it, but the wife took it personally. The author's main concern is that the wife feels excluded and that they didn't want to suggest a solution like a babysitter because they know the husband's financial situation. \n\nBut is the author at fault? The problem was a group consensus, not just the author's opinion. The author might have contributed to the discussion but didn't act unilaterally. However, the group's approach might have been insensitive. The wife might feel that her ability to play is being criticized, especially since she's a new player and a friend. The author's empathy is noted, but maybe the group should have approached the discussion more delicately.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the group collectively agreed it was an issue and brought it up, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being part of that group. However, the way the issue was raised might have been mishandled. The key point is whether the author should have spoken up differently or if the group's approach was too harsh. Since the author didn't act outside the group's consensus, they might not be at fault. Alternatively, if the author didn't contribute to the conversation, they might share some responsibility.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's role. The author didn't bring it up, expressed empathy, and didn't suggest a solution that could add financial burden. The main issue was the wife's reaction post-discussion. The author's actions don't seem malicious, but the outcome was negative. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the problem was a group decision, and the author didn't act unilaterally. However, the group might have handled it poorly, but the author isn't solely responsible.\n"
