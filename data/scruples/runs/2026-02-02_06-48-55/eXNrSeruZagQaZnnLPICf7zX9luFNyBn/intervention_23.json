We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D game group that meets at a couple's house, and after the couple has a baby, the baby is causing distractions. The author tells the hosts that the baby is an issue, which leads to the wife being upset and leaving the group.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The group plays D&D weekly, hosted by the couple. The baby is mobile, loud, causes interruptions, and even led to an ER visit once. The author notes that everyone agreed the baby was a problem, but when the issue was brought up by a DM, the wife reacted badly, feeling excluded. The author is empathetic but also wants the game nights to be fun, not stressful.\n\nThe author is saying they're not the one who brought up the issue; the DM did. But the author was part of the consensus that the baby was an issue. The problem is whether it's wrong to address the baby's impact on the game. The author's concern is that the wife might not be able to participate anymore, and they feel bad about it.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the group is using their time to relax, and the baby is disrupting that. The hosts are accommodating them, but the baby's presence is making it hard. The group has a right to enjoy their hobby. On the other hand, bringing up the issue in a way that makes the wife feel excluded could be hurtful. The wife is a friend and part of the group, and the author is worried about her feelings.\n\nBut the author didn't suggest a babysitter due to financial constraints. The DM brought up the issue, not the author. The author says they felt it was affecting everyone's enjoyment. The problem is whether voicing a concern about a baby in a social group is wrong. It's a sensitive topic because it involves a new parent's situation.\n\nI think the key here is that the group collectively agreed the baby was a problem. They had to address it somehow. The author's intention was to maintain the game's quality and their own enjoyment. However, the way it was handled (by the DM) caused the wife to feel excluded. The author isn't directly responsible for the wife's reaction, but they were part of the consensus. However, the author didn't confront the hosts directly. Maybe they should have tried to address it more sensitively. But since the DM did it, and the author is empathizing with the wife's feelings, perhaps the author isn't the asshole here. They had valid concerns about the group's experience. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling the hosts their baby is an issue. The author didn't do that; the DM did. The author was part of the group that agreed the baby was a problem, but they didn't act on it themselves. The author might feel guilty but isn't directly responsible for the wife's reaction. Therefore, they're not in the wrong.\n"
