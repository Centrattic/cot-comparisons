We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group where the hosts have a baby now, and the baby is causing issues during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is a distraction, leading to interruptions, and even a trip to the ER once. They tried to handle it but eventually, the issue was brought up by a DM, leading to the wife being upset and leaving the group chats.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The hosts had been hosting for three years, and they went out of their way to make the game nights happen. When the baby arrived, it created problems. The author and others felt the baby was affecting their enjoyment. But the author didn't want to be the one to bring it up, so it was the DM who did. The wife reacted strongly, feeling excluded, and the author is now feeling guilty.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. One angle is that the group collectively felt the baby was an issue, so maybe the author wasn't alone in the decision. However, the author did participate in the consensus to address the problem, which might imply some responsibility. The author also feels empathy and guilt, suggesting they might have regretted the outcome.\n\nBut then, the hosts are friends, and the baby is part of their family. The author might not have wanted to hurt the wife's feelings. The problem is that the group's enjoyment is important for their well-being. Maybe the right approach would have been to suggest solutions first, like a babysitter, but the author considered that too expensive, especially since the husband lost his job. So maybe the group didn't have a better option. However, the way the issue was brought up might have been harsh, leading to the wife's reaction. \n\nThe author didn't want to be the one to bring it up, so they let the DM handle it. But since the group agreed on the problem, perhaps it's not entirely their fault. On the other hand, maybe they should have found a more sensitive way to address the issue, considering the hosts' situation. The author's empathy is clear, but the action of agreeing to address the problem led to negative consequences. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is often about intent and the impact. The author's intent was to address a real issue affecting everyone's enjoyment. The impact was hurting a friend's feelings. However, the group's action might have been necessary given that they're paying for hosting and the baby's presence is causing real problems. The alternative of not addressing it would mean continued stress for everyone. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the group collectively decided to address the issue, and the author was part of that consensus. The problem was how the DM communicated it, not the author specifically. The author's role was more about supporting the group's decision rather than being the one to bring it up. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But there's a nuance here. The author did participate in the decision to address the issue, which contributed to the outcome. However, they weren't the one to bring it up directly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is partially at fault because they should have considered the hosts' feelings more and perhaps tried harder to find alternative solutions before escalating. But the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. However, given the context, perhaps the author isn't the main culprit here. The DM who brought it up might share some blame for how it was communicated. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because they were part of a group decision to address an issue that was affecting everyone's enjoyment. The main issue was the DM's approach, not the author's. So the answer could be B.\n"
