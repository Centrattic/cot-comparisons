We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a D&D group where the hosts have a baby that's causing disruptions. The author mentions that the baby is distracting, causing interruptions, and leading to stress. They didn't bring up the issue themselves but were part of a group that eventually did, leading to the wife being upset and leaving the group.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple has been hosting for three years, and the baby is a new variable. The author and others are friends, and the wife was excited to join the game. The main conflict is that the baby's presence is affecting the game's enjoyment for everyone. The author feels guilty because the wife took it hard and they don't want to suggest a costly solution like a babysitter due to the husband's recent job loss.\n\nThe author didn't raise the issue themselves but was part of a consensus. They also express empathy for the wife's feelings. The question is whether bringing up the issue as a group was wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the group's game nights are important for their relaxation, and the baby's disruptions are affecting that. On the other hand, the hosts are already making sacrifices by hosting, and the wife was trying to integrate into the group. The author didn't want to be the one to bring it up, which shows hesitation, but they were part of a group decision. \n\nThe key points are: Was the group's decision to address the baby's impact inappropriate? Did they handle it correctly? The wife's reaction was strong, but the group's intention was to restore enjoyment for everyone. The author's empathy and not suggesting a financial burden shows consideration. \n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, it's often about balance. If the group collectively decided the baby was a problem and communicated it respectfully, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the wife's exclusion from the games now is a consequence they didn't intend. But considering the hosts' efforts and the wife's desire to participate, maybe they should have found a middle ground first, like suggesting a babysitter if possible. \n\nThe author's argument is that the group's time is precious and the baby's presence was affecting their fun. The hosts might need to adjust, but the way the issue was brought up might have been harsh. The answer might hinge on whether the group handled it respectfully and offered alternatives. Since the author didn't suggest a financial solution and was part of a group decision, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the approach was abrupt without considering the hosts' situation, maybe they are. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because the group had a legitimate concern about their enjoyment and tried to address it without placing blame on the parents. They considered the hosts' financial situation and the wife's participation, so the author's intentions were good, even if the outcome was unintended.\n"
