We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a D&D game group that meets at a couple's home. The couple had a baby, which is causing disruptions during game nights. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction, leading to interruptions during the game. The author mentions that the group consensus was that the baby was affecting their enjoyment, so one of the DMs brought up the issue with the couple. The wife took it badly, feeling excluded now, and the author feels bad about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple is hosting the game nights, which is a significant gesture since they rearrange their home and provide supplies. The baby's presence is causing real issues\u2014like needing to leave the game, missing parts of the story, and even a trip to the ER. The group is made up of busy adults using the game nights as a way to unwind. \n\nThe author didn't bring up the issue themselves but supported when someone else did. The key point is whether addressing the problem was justified. On one hand, the group's enjoyment is important, especially since they put time and effort into these gatherings. On the other hand, the couple's ability to host with a baby is a valid challenge. The author might be concerned about the wife's reaction because she wanted to participate and now feels excluded. \n\nI should also think about alternatives. The author mentions not suggesting a babysitter due to the husband's recent unemployment. That shows consideration for the couple's financial situation. However, maybe there were other solutions not considered, like adjusting the game times or moving the games elsewhere. But the group did try for a few months before addressing it. \n\nThe wife's reaction of feeling she can't play again suggests that the couple might need to find another way to manage, but the group's consensus was that the baby was causing issues. The author's intention was to maintain the group's enjoyment, which is reasonable. However, the way the issue was brought up might have been handled differently to avoid making the wife feel excluded. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't the one who directly communicated the problem, but they supported the decision. The problem here is a conflict between the group's needs and the hosts' circumstances. Since the group is relying on the couple's home, there's an implicit understanding that hosting comes with certain responsibilities. The baby's presence complicating this is a new variable. \n\nThe author's empathy for the wife's feelings is noted, but they might not be in the wrong for supporting a necessary conversation. The main issue is whether the group's actions were fair, but the question is about the author's role. Since the author didn't initiate the conversation and shared the group's consensus, they might not be at fault. However, maybe there's room for a more nuanced approach. \n\nOverall, the author's actions seem justified as they were part of a group trying to address a genuine problem that was affecting everyone's experience. The wife's feelings are valid, but the group's need to have a functional game night is also important. The answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they were part of a collective decision to address a real issue, even if it had unintended consequences.\n"
