We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the D&D group situation is in the wrong (AITA). The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nSo the setup is that the hosts of the D&D game have a baby, which is causing disruptions. The baby is mobile, loud, and has caused some issues like needing the ER. The group, including the author, has decided the baby is a problem and it's affecting everyone's enjoyment. The DMs brought it up to the couple, the wife took it badly, left the group chats, etc. The author feels bad because they wanted to include the wife as a friend but now she's upset.\n\nThe author didn't directly bring it up, but they were part of the consensus. They also mention the husband's job situation and don't want to suggest a babysitter. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if bringing up the issue as a group was necessary. The hosts are friends, so maybe they should have handled it more sensitively. But the baby is causing actual problems\u2014ER visits, distractions, stress. The group needs to play, which is important for them.\n\nHowever, the wife took it as a personal attack, especially since she joined the game. Maybe the group should have approached the couple privately first before making it a group issue. But the author wasn't the one to bring it up; the DM did. The author was part of the consensus, which might mean they share some responsibility.\n\nBut the question is about the author specifically. The author didn't want to be the one to bring it up, so they didn't take the lead. The problem is that the wife felt excluded, and the author is empathetic. However, the group's enjoyment is important too. Is it fair to have a baby at a game night that's supposed to be adults' time to unwind? It's a common dilemma with parents and social gatherings.\n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, the consensus often suggests that it's reasonable to set boundaries, but the approach matters. If the group had a private talk with the couple before publicly discussing it, maybe it would have been better. But the author wasn't the one to raise it. The main issue is that the wife felt excluded, which is hurtful. But the baby is causing tangible issues.\n\nThe author's part is being part of the consensus and not taking responsibility for suggesting alternatives like a babysitter. However, the author might have felt that it's not feasible for the couple. The answer hinges on whether the group's approach was wrong. If the group came to a consensus and communicated it respectfully, maybe not. But if they made the couple feel blamed, then maybe they are at fault.\n\nIn AITA cases, it's often a mix. The author might be partly in the wrong for being part of the group that discussed the baby's impact without considering the hosts' situation more carefully. But on the other hand, the group has the right to expect their game nights to be enjoyable. Since the author didn't directly confront the hosts and was part of a group decision, maybe they aren't the one at fault. However, the wife's reaction suggests the approach was hurtful. Since the author is feeling guilty and empathetic, maybe they share some responsibility but aren't the main one. But the answer options are A or B.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the issue was a group consensus, and the author didn't directly confront the hosts. The main problem was the DM's approach, not the author's. The author's intentions were good, and the group had legitimate concerns about their enjoyment. While the approach could have been better, the author isn't the one at fault here.\n"
