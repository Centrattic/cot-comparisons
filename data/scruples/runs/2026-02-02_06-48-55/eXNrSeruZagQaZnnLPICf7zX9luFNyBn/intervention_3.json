We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a D&D group that's been meeting at a couple's house for a couple of years. The couple has a baby now, which is causing some issues during game nights. The baby is loud and a distraction, and the wife has to leave to take care of him, which disrupts the game. The author didn't want to bring it up themselves, so they waited until others did. The DM finally mentioned it, the wife was upset, and now they're wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple are the hosts, and they've been doing a lot for the group. The baby is a new factor, and the group's consensus was that it's affecting their enjoyment. The author didn't directly approach the couple but others did. The wife's reaction was pretty strong, leaving the chats and being upset. The author feels bad because the wife is their friend and didn't want her to feel excluded.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author should have addressed the issue themselves or if waiting for the DM was appropriate. The author mentions they didn't want to be the one to bring it up, which might indicate they felt uncomfortable or hesitant. However, in a group setting, if several people are experiencing the same problem, it's important to communicate it collectively or respectfully. \n\nBut the author didn't act alone; the group came to a consensus, and the DM raised the issue. The author might not be in the wrong for not speaking up first, especially if they were part of the consensus. However, maybe they could have approached the couple more sensitively before the problem escalated? The wife's reaction suggests that the way the issue was brought up was hurtful. The author's empathy is clear, but the group's enjoyment is also valid. \n\nAlso, the author considered suggesting a babysitter but felt it would be an imposition, especially with the husband's job situation. That shows they tried to be considerate, which is a positive point. However, the problem was already causing stress and affecting the game's flow. \n\nIn many social groups, when there's a change (like a new baby) that affects the group's activities, it's important to address it in a way that's supportive and understanding. Maybe the group could have discussed the issue earlier with the couple, offering options like finding a babysitter, adjusting meeting times, or moving the game to another location. But the author might not be the one at fault if they were part of the group consensus and others took the lead. \n\nHowever, the wife's exclusion from the game now is a result of the group's decision, and the author is upset about that. The question is whether the author is \"in the wrong\" for contributing to the discussion. Group decisions sometimes lead to unintended consequences, but if the author supported the decision and didn't push for anything hurtful, they might not be wrong. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have tried to mediate the discussion or help the group approach the couple more gently. But the author's role wasn't to confront the hosts; they were part of a group that did so. The main issue is the group's collective decision, not the author's individual action. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. The problem was a shared concern, and the group decided to address it. The wife's reaction is more about how the issue was brought up rather than the author specifically. Therefore, the answer might be B (No). But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The author did express the problem in the group, leading to the DM confronting the hosts. The author's participation in that discussion could be seen as necessary, as the game's environment was being negatively impacted. So, the author isn't in the wrong for speaking up as part of the group's consensus, even if it led to the wife's upset. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
