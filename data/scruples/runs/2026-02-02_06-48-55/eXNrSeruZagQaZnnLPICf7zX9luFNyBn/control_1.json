We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person (the author) is at fault (AITA) for bringing up the issue of the baby during their D&D game nights. Let me break down the details.\n\nSo, the setup: The group plays D&D weekly at the hosts' home for three years. The hosts are friends, they set up the space, provide snacks, and have a lot of game stuff. Then the hosts have a baby. The baby is mobile and loud, causing distractions, even leading to a trip to the ER once. The baby's presence makes the games less enjoyable, with interruptions and stress. The author didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue because they weren't the DM, but others agreed it was a problem. Eventually, a DM did bring it up, and the wife reacted strongly, removing herself from the group. The author feels bad for their friend.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the author didn't directly confront the hosts. Instead, they discussed the issue with the group, and others agreed. Then the DMs brought it up to the couple. The author's role here is more about voicing a concern that others shared. The problem arises from the baby's impact on the game, not from the author's actions. The author tried to avoid being the one to bring it up, showing they considered the hosts' feelings. However, the main issue is whether it was wrong to address the problem in the first place.\n\nThe hosts had a baby, which is a significant life change. The game nights were a social gathering, but the baby's presence made it hard to enjoy. The group is made up of busy adults who use game nights to unwind. It's understandable that they'd want the game to be enjoyable. The author and others felt the baby was causing stress and distractions. But the wife felt excluded, and the husband's job loss adds financial strain. The author considered suggesting a babysitter but thought it'd be insensitive given the husband's situation.\n\nThe author's intention was to maintain the group's enjoyment, not to single out the hosts. However, the way the issue was addressed might have been handled poorly. The DMs brought it up, but the wife reacted negatively. The author's empathy is clear, but the question is about being in the wrong.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about intentions and how the situation was handled. The author tried to be diplomatic by not being the one to bring it up and by discussing it with others first. However, the fact that the group as a whole felt it was an issue suggests that the problem was real. The hosts might have needed to find a solution, like hiring a babysitter or moving the game elsewhere. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out a legitimate problem that affects everyone. But maybe the approach could have been more sensitive. However, since the author didn't directly confront them and others were involved, it's more about the group's collective decision to address it. The author isn't at fault for voicing a concern that others shared. The hosts' reaction is on them, but the author's role was appropriate. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
