We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling the hosts their baby is causing issues at the D&D game. The author explains that the baby is a distraction, causing interruptions, and even made the couple miss parts of the game. They mention that the DM already brought it up, and the wife reacted badly, leaving the group chats. The author feels bad because the wife is a friend and they don't want to suggest a babysitter due to the husband's job loss.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social dynamics here. The hosts are providing a space for the group to play, which is a big deal because others don't have the space. The baby's presence is causing problems, but the author isn't the DM. They waited for the DM to address it, which seems responsible. However, the way the issue was brought up might have been hurtful to the wife, especially since she's new to the game. Maybe the DM's approach was harsh, leading to her withdrawal. The author isn't directly responsible for how the DM handled it. But the author did express the group's consensus, so maybe they should have considered a more empathetic approach.\n\nAlso, the author is empathetic and feels bad about the wife's reaction. They tried to avoid making it personal, but the wife took it as a personal affront. The problem is that the baby is affecting everyone's enjoyment, but the solution might require a compromise. The author isn't suggesting a babysitter, which could be a practical solution, but the husband's financial situation complicates that. Maybe the group could have offered to split the cost of a babysitter, but the author didn't suggest that. However, the author isn't in a position to propose that since they aren't the ones who raised the issue.\n\nThe main question is whether expressing a concern about a baby being a distraction is inconsiderate. It's a delicate situation because it's about a child, which can be sensitive. The author's intention was to address the group's frustration, but the execution might have been poor. However, the author isn't the one who brought it up directly; the DM did. So maybe the author isn't at fault, but the DM is. The author might be overthinking their role here, thinking they were wrong when they were just part of the consensus. They should have perhaps supported the wife in finding a solution rather than just voicing the problem. But since the issue was already brought up by the DM, the author's role was to voice the group's feelings. It's a tough call, but I think the author isn't in the wrong because they expressed a valid concern as part of a group consensus, even if the outcome was negative.\n"
