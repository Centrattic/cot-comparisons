We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for telling the hosts that their baby is an issue.\n\nFirst, the situation: They have a D&D group that meets at a couple's home. The hosts are friends, and the group appreciates their effort. After the hosts have a baby, the baby becomes disruptive. The baby is loud, mobile, causes interruptions, and even led to an ER visit once. The group consensus is that the baby is affecting the game's enjoyment. The author wasn't the DM, so they didn't bring it up initially. Eventually, one of the DMs did, and the wife reacted poorly, feeling excluded from the games now. The author feels bad because they care about the wife and don't want to suggest a babysitter due to the husband's recent job loss.\n\nSo, the author is asking if they're at fault. The key points here are:\n\n1. The group came to a consensus that the baby was an issue. So it's not just the author's opinion.\n2. The author didn't bring up the issue themselves; it was the DMs who did. The author might have felt uncomfortable doing it as a friend.\n3. The wife's reaction was strong, and the author is empathetic towards her feelings.\n4. The author considered the hosts' financial situation regarding a babysitter.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main question is whether it's acceptable to address a problem that affects group activities, especially when it's a consensus issue. The author didn't act alone; the DMs did. The author might have felt conflicted because of their friendship with the wife, but the group's enjoyment is also a valid concern. The hosts opened their home, and it's understandable that others would want to maintain the game's quality. \n\nHowever, the way the issue was brought up might have been a problem. If the DMs approached it without considering the wife's feelings, that could have caused the reaction. But the author's role here was more of a participant and a friend, not the one who initiated the discussion. The author's empathy and consideration for the hosts' situation suggest they tried to be understanding. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for wanting to address the issue that's affecting the group's experience. It's a common problem in group activities where personal circumstances intersect. The main issue might be how the DMs communicated the problem rather than the author's involvement. Since the group agreed it was an issue, the author isn't at fault for participating in that consensus. So, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
