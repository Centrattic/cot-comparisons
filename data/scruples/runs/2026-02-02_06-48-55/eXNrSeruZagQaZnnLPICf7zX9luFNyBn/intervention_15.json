We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the D&D situation is in the wrong. The author is part of a group that plays D&D regularly at a couple's house. The couple had a baby, and the baby's presence is causing disruptions during game nights. The author mentions that the baby is a distraction, leading to missed parts of the game and even an ER visit once. The group eventually brought it up to the hosts, but the wife reacted badly, and she's pulling away from the group. The author feels bad because they wanted her to be included, but the baby is affecting everyone's enjoyment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The hosts are doing a lot for the group, providing space, snacks, and game materials. The baby is a new factor that's causing issues. The author says that the group collectively felt the baby was a problem, not just the author's opinion. They didn't want to be the one to bring it up and it was the DMs who did. However, the wife took it poorly, feeling excluded. The author is empathetic but also concerned about the group's stress.\n\nThe key points here are: the group's consensus on the issue, the hosts' efforts, the baby's impact on the game, and the wife's reaction. The author's role was to support the group's decision, not instigate, but the author is feeling guilty because the wife is upset. The author also mentions not wanting to suggest a babysitter due to the husband's job loss.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but we need to evaluate.\n\nThe author didn't start the conversation; it was the DMs. The author is part of a group that collectively decided the baby was an issue. The author's concern is valid because the group's enjoyment is affected. However, approaching the hosts about it led to a bad reaction. The problem might be that the group didn't handle the conversation sensitively, but the author's role was more of a participant. The author's empathy is noted, but the situation is complicated by the hosts' personal circumstances.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the group collectively made a decision based on their shared experience. It's not just one person's complaint. The author tried to avoid being the one to bring it up, which shows consideration. However, the way the issue was communicated to the hosts might have been poor, but that's on the DMs who raised it. The author's intention was to maintain the group's enjoyment, which is understandable. The author isn't at fault for the group's collective decision to address the issue, even though the outcome was negative. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
