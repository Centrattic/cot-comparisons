We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a D&D group that used to meet at a couple's house. After the couple had a baby, the baby became a distraction, causing the wife to leave the games. The author says the group discussed the baby being an issue and decided it was affecting everyone's enjoyment. They didn't want to be the DM to bring it up, but eventually, a DM did, and the wife took it badly.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Hmm. Let me break this down. \n\nFirst, the hosts have been generous for three years, providing space, games, snacks. The baby's presence is causing disruptions: noise, interruptions, even an ER visit. The group collectively felt it was affecting their fun. But when the DM brought it up, the wife was hurt and left the group chats.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the key points are communication and consideration. Even though the group agreed the baby was an issue, the way it was addressed might have been harsh. The author mentions they didn't want to be the DM to bring it up, which is fair. But when the DM did, the wife felt excluded. The author is feeling guilty because they care about the wife as a friend.\n\nBut does the author have a responsibility here? They were part of the group that decided the baby was a problem and supported the DM in bringing it up. However, maybe they could have done more to address the issue without making the wife feel excluded. For example, suggesting alternatives like a babysitter, but the author noted the financial situation. However, the author might not have been in a position to suggest solutions.\n\nAnother angle: the hosts are doing a favor by hosting. The group's right to enjoy their game vs. the hosts' personal situation. Maybe they should have tried to adjust, like playing in a different location or having a flexible schedule. But the author mentions that most people don't have the space, so that's a problem.\n\nThe wife's reaction is intense. She might feel like her needs as a new mother aren't being considered. The author's guilt is valid, but was the group's action justified? The group was trying to maintain their own enjoyment, which is reasonable. But they didn't consider the wife's feelings of being excluded. However, the author isn't directly responsible for the DM's approach, though they were part of the consensus.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The group had a shared problem, and even though the approach hurt someone, the author's intentions were to maintain the group's enjoyment. However, they might not have considered the wife's perspective enough. But since they felt empathy and regret, maybe they're not entirely at fault. The answer might depend on whether the group handled it poorly, but the author's role was more of a participant in the discussion. So I think the answer is B, no, the author isn't in the wrong. The main issue is how the DM communicated it, not the author's role in the discussion.\n"
