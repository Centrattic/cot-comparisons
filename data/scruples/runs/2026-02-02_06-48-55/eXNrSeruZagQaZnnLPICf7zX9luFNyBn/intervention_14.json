We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling the hosts of their D&D game that their baby is an issue. The situation involves a group that plays D&D weekly, hosted at a couple's home. They had a baby a year ago, and the baby's presence is causing disruptions. The author mentions that the baby is loud, a distraction, and has even led to emergency situations. The group eventually brought up the issue, but the wife took it badly, feeling excluded.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they wanted to address the problem because the game nights were supposed to be a way to unwind, but the baby was making it stressful. They feel bad because the wife is upset and they don't want to suggest a costly babysitter solution.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. \n\nFirst, the author says that the group collectively felt the baby was an issue. So it wasn't just their personal opinion but a shared concern. The problem is that when the issue was raised, it caused conflict. The wife felt excluded, and now she's removed herself from the group. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, they approached the issue through the DM, not directly. The author also shows empathy, understanding the wife's feelings. However, maybe the way the issue was brought up could have been handled more sensitively. Perhaps the group should have discussed it more privately and found solutions like a babysitter, even if they couldn't afford it themselves. But the author didn't suggest that, maybe out of guilt or not wanting to add financial burden.\n\nOn the other hand, the hosts have a right to host their home as they see fit. The group might have overstepped by not considering alternatives first. The author might not be entirely in the wrong because the problem was real and affecting everyone's enjoyment. But maybe they should have handled the communication differently. The author's intention was to improve the game experience for everyone, but the fallout suggests that the approach didn't consider the personal aspects enough.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The problem existed, and the group's intent was to address it, but the execution hurt a friend's feelings. The answer might be A (Yes) because they contributed to the conflict, even if unintentionally. Or B (No) because they were trying to solve a legitimate issue. But given that the wife's participation was valued and the issue was addressed in a way that excluded her, maybe the author is not entirely at fault. However, the way the problem was raised could have been more compassionate. Hmm, perhaps the answer is A, but I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, maybe it's not entirely their fault because the problem was collective.\n"
