We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the D&D game situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the setup is a group of adults playing D&D weekly at a couple's house. The hosts are friends, and they've been doing this for three years. The hosts rearrange their basement, provide snacks, and have game supplies. Then the couple has a baby. The baby is mobile, loud, causes distractions, and even led to an ER visit once. The baby's presence makes the games hard because people have to leave to take care of him, causing them to miss parts of the game. The author mentions that everyone agreed the baby was an issue affecting their enjoyment. They wanted to unwind but it became stressful. A DM finally brought it up, and the wife was upset, pulling out of the group chats and not playing anymore. The author feels bad for her and doesn't want to suggest a babysitter because the husband lost his job.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The hosts are providing a space for the group, and their new baby has started to interfere with the group's activities. The group's consensus was that the baby was a problem. The author didn't raise the issue directly but others did. The main conflict is between the hosts' situation (new baby) and the group's need for a focused game environment.\n\nThe author's intent was to bring up the issue but didn't because they didn't want to be the one to cause conflict. However, someone else did, leading to the wife's reaction. The author feels guilty because they value the friendship with the wife.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a social dilemma. The group's needs versus the hosts' personal situation. The author isn't the one who made the comment, but they were part of the consensus. The wife's reaction is understandable because being excluded from her own game and having to leave due to her child's needs might feel like a rejection. However, the group's right to enjoy their game is also valid. The author might not be in the wrong if the issue was discussed collectively, but maybe the way it was addressed could have been more sensitive. However, the author didn't act unilaterally; they waited for the DM to bring it up. The wife's withdrawal is a consequence of the group's actions, not just the author's. So, the author's role is more about being part of a group decision, not acting alone. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the problem was a group issue and the author didn't act out of malice but concern for the group's enjoyment, while also feeling empathy for the wife.\n"
