We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe setup is that a group of adults play D&D weekly at a couple's house. The couple has a baby now, which is causing disruptions: noise, the parents leaving the game to attend to the baby, and even an ER visit once. The problem is that the baby is a distraction and affecting everyone's enjoyment. The author didn't bring it up directly because they weren't the DM, but someone else did. The wife took it badly, saying she can't play anymore, and has distanced herself. The author is feeling bad and is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The group had a consensus that the baby was an issue. The author didn't act alone; the DM brought it up. The author was trying to find a solution but didn't want to be the one to bring it up because they wanted the wife to stay involved. The group is using the couple's home, which they appreciate, but the baby is making it hard to enjoy. The wife's reaction was quite strong, and the author is empathizing with her feelings.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are communication and empathy. The group had reached a consensus, so the issue wasn't just the author's opinion. However, the way the problem was addressed might have been handled better. The author didn't directly confront the couple, which could be seen as avoiding responsibility, but they weren't in a position of authority (not the DM). The real issue came up when the DM brought it up and the wife reacted negatively.\n\nThe author's main concern is that bringing up the baby's impact might make the wife feel excluded, which is valid. The author's intentions seem to be good\u2014they wanted the wife to participate and were empathetic to her situation. However, the group's enjoyment is also a factor. The problem is that the baby's presence is affecting the group dynamic, and the group did have a consensus on this issue. The author didn't act alone, but as a member of the group, they might have some responsibility in how the conversation was approached. \n\nBut the author didn't start the conversation themselves, and they were not the DM. The DM was the one who approached the couple, so maybe the author isn't the one to blame. The author's empathy towards the wife is genuine, and they tried to avoid making it personal. However, the outcome was that the wife left, and the author feels guilty. The key here is whether it's fair to expect the author to have spoken up before the DM did. \n\nSince the group had a consensus, perhaps the author was justified in not being the one to bring it up, especially since they wanted the wife to stay. The problem might lie more in how the DM communicated the issue rather than the author's inaction. The author's role was more of a participant, so they might not be in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the author is considered part of the group that wanted the change, but they didn't take the lead. Since the DM brought it up and the wife reacted negatively, the author's share of responsibility might be low. So the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
