We've mostly had our games at the home of a married couple that we are all friends with. They go out of their way to rearrange their basement for us to play, and they have a large supply of game paraphernalia and minis that belong to the husband. They also usually supply snacks, although others bring some to share as well. I've always appreciated that they open up their home to use for game nights, most if us would not have the space that we need to get together.\n\nA little more than a year ago, they had a baby. I have no issues with children in general, I just don't have a lot of experience with them. The wife also started playing in our games (there are 2 different ones), which I was really excited about because she is a good friend of mine. Previously there had been a long-running game with heavy storyline that would have been hard to get into, but with the new ones starting she took that chance. \n\nNow to the issue. The baby is mobile, loud, and a distraction. He gets into things he's not supposed to and has landed them in the emergency room because they thought he had eaten something dangerous during one of our games (he was fine, but better safe than sorry). When he starts making a lot of noise, either the wife or the husband would have to leave the table to take care of him. This would either cause them to miss the storyline or combat, or stall the game for a long time. If they just end up missing what goes on, we still have to explain all of the events that happened when they get back. The baby also screams while playing and causes headaches for many.\n\nI am not the DM for either of the two games that are hosted at that house, so I didn't want to be the one to bring up the issue with them. Please note that everyone came to the consensus that the baby was an issue and was effecting everyone's enjoyment. We are busy adults and we have little time for ourselves, and game nights are how we all unwind and have fun. It was becoming more stress and headaches than fun. \n\nAfter a few months of trying to deal with the issue, it was finally brought up by one of the dm's to the couple. The wife didn't take it well. She apparently said something like \"so I can't play ever again.\" She has removed herself from all of the group chats and from what I hear she is still very upset more than a week later. I have a lot of empathy for how she's feeling so I feel horrible. I wanted her to be included and to spend time with her because she is my friend.\n\nI would also feel like an ass for suggesting that they pay for a babysitter because I know babies are not cheap and the husband just got let go from his job of over 10 years. \n\n\nTLDR: The couple that hosts our gane nights at their house had a baby, baby becomes an issue and distraction, wife can no longer participate even though she was just able to join. AITA?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the D&D situation is in the wrong. The question is between answer A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no, they aren't).\n\nFirst, I need to read through the scenario again. The couple hosts the D&D games, and after their baby was born, the baby started causing problems during game nights. The baby is mobile, noisy, and even led to an ER trip once. The group agreed the baby was a distraction, but when the DM finally brought it up, the wife was really upset and left the group chats.\n\nThe author mentions that they didn't bring it up first because they weren't the DM and didn't want to be the one to say it. But they were part of the group that felt the baby was affecting everyone's enjoyment. They also empathize with the wife, since she's a friend and the husband just got laid off, so suggesting a babysitter is out of the question.\n\nSo the key points are: the group collectively felt the baby was an issue, the author didn't directly confront the hosts but was part of the group that agreed, the wife reacted badly, and the author is feeling guilty.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The author didn't confront the hosts themselves; they waited for the DM to do it. However, they were part of the consensus that the baby was a problem. The wife's reaction suggests that bringing up the issue hurt her feelings, making her feel excluded. The author's empathy is noted, but they contributed to the group's decision to address it.\n\nIs it the author's fault? Well, they didn't act alone. The DM brought it up, not the author. The author might feel responsible because they were part of the group that felt the baby was a problem, but they didn't directly cause the conflict. However, maybe they could have approached it more sensitively. But the main action was taken by the DM. The author's remorse is genuine, but the question is whether they are in the wrong.\n\nIn such situations, it's often about how the issue is raised. If the group consensus is that there's a problem, but the way it's communicated is hurtful, then the responsibility is shared. The author, being part of the group, might share some blame for not ensuring the conversation was handled with more care. But since they didn't take the lead and the DM was the one to bring it up, maybe the author isn't the main person at fault. However, they were part of the group that wanted to address it, so maybe they contributed to the problem. \n\nAlternatively, they were trying to do the right thing by ensuring the group's enjoyment, but the execution was poor. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because they were part of a group decision, and the main issue was how the DM communicated it. The author's role was more passive, just agreeing with the problem but not the one who spoke up. \n\nBut the author might still feel responsible because they were part of the group that wanted to address the issue. It's a bit of a gray area. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), then it's because they were part of a group effort and the main action was taken by the DM. However, if the answer is A (in the wrong), it's because the author contributed to the problem and didn't consider the emotional impact on the wife. \n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't directly confront the hosts, so they aren't the one who caused the wife's upset. The DM did that. The author's guilt comes from being part of the group, but they can't be fully blamed. So the answer might be B, they're not in the wrong. However, maybe there's something about not considering enough the wife's perspective before bringing it up. The author mentions empathy but was part of the group that wanted to address it. \n\nAnother angle: Was it the group's responsibility to communicate this issue in a supportive way? The author didn't take the lead, but maybe they should have. However, they weren't the DM, so maybe it's understandable they waited. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is not the one who brought up the issue, so the main blame is on the DM. The author's participation in the group's consensus is part of the problem, but they aren't the sole person at fault. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
