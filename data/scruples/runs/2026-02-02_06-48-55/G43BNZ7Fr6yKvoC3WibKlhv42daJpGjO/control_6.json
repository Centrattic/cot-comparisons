The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully. \n\nThe person (the author) is asking if they're in the wrong for not helping their brother who's going through a divorce. They mention their brother is the only family they have, but their relationship has been strained. The author's past experiences with his brother's wife causing issues in their lives are significant here.\n\nFirst, the author had a bad divorce a few years back when they were 19. They asked their brother for help, but he didn't support them, which made things really tough. The brother's wife was spreading lies, and the author felt abandoned. Later, when the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, they confronted her, but the brother took her side, leading to a fallout and no contact for two years. The author admits to some vindictive texts when drunk, but claims they were just venting. \n\nNow, the brother has realized his wife was cheating (with the same guy) and is getting a divorce. He wants help, but the author's wife is against supporting him because of past issues. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points are the brother's past behavior and the author's current decision. The brother didn't support the author during their own divorce, took his wife's side when she cheated, and the author has a valid reason to be wary. The brother's wife had a vendetta before, so the author's wife is cautious. \n\nThe author is considering not helping because of the brother's past. Is that fair? Well, the brother wronged the author twice. First by withholding support during a crisis, then by ignoring the affair and taking the unfaithful wife's side. The author has every right to be hurt and want to protect themselves. The brother is only now realizing the truth, but maybe he didn't act on it sooner. The author's decision to not help could be seen as self-preservation rather than being in the wrong. \n\nHowever, maybe the brother is genuinely sorry and the author is being too harsh. But given the history, the author's hesitation makes sense. The brother's wife's actions were toxic, and the brother was complicit in that. The author didn't owe their brother support after all that. So, probably, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
