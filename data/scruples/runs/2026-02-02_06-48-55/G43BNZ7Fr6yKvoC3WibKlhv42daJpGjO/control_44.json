The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be a Twat/Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about whether the person should help their brother going through a divorce. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the story. The author and his brother are close, but their relationship was damaged years ago. The author had a bad divorce at 19, and when he asked his brother for help, the brother didn't support him. The brother's wife was spreading lies, which the author is still confused about. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was cheating but the brother didn't believe him and cut ties. Now, the brother is going through the same situation, and the author is considering not helping again. The wife of the author is against helping the brother because of past issues.\n\nSo the key points here are the past betrayal. The brother didn't support the author during his tough time, took his wife's side when the author was trying to help, and cut off contact. Now the roles are somewhat reversed. The author is hesitant because of the history, and his current wife is also against helping. \n\nFrom the perspective of family support, usually, you're supposed to support each other. But there's also the aspect of past harm. If the brother was unsupportive before, maybe the author is justified in not wanting to help now. The brother's wife's actions were deceitful, and the brother believed her over his own brother. The author was the one who actually uncovered the affair. \n\nThe author also mentions that he did some things when drunk, but he admits they're irrelevant. The main issue is the brother's previous lack of support and betrayal. So, in terms of being in the wrong, if the brother was the one who wronged the author first, maybe the author isn't in the wrong now for not helping. Especially if the brother was part of the problem by not listening and cutting off.\n\nBut some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. However, the brother's actions were pretty harmful. The author went through a tough divorce and was suicidal, and the brother didn't help. Now the brother is in a similar situation, but given his past, the author might feel justified in not offering help. \n\nSo the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. Considering the brother's previous behavior, the author's current wife's stance, and the history of betrayal, it's likely the author is not in the wrong here. The answer would be B, No.\n"
