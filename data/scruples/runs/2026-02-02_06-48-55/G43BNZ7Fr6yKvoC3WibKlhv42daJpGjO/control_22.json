The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author were very close. The author had a messy divorce years ago and asked for help, but the brother was unsupportive, even to the point of being hostile. The author's current wife helped them through that tough time. Then, later, the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, confronted them, but the brother took his wife's side and cut off contact. The author admitted to some angry texts while drunk, which is understandable but not great. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and is asking for help, but the author's wife wants no part of it due to past resentments. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of hurt and betrayal. The brother didn't support the author when they needed it, took his wife's side over his brother, and severed the relationship. Now, the author is being asked to help again, but given the past, the author might feel justified in not helping. The brother only reached out after realizing his wife was cheating again, which seems to mirror the past situation.\n\nI need to consider whether the author is obligated to help despite the brother's past behavior. The brother's actions were hurtful, and the author has valid reasons to be cautious. The author's wife's opposition also plays a role here. The brother's current request might be genuine, but the author isn't obligated to help someone who previously wronged them. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and past experiences. So, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
