The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author are close family, the only family they have. The author had a messy divorce years ago and asked for help, but the brother didn't support him and even took his wife's side when the author was trying to help by confronting the brother's wife's affair. The brother cut off contact after that. Now, the brother has found out his wife was cheating (same guy) and wants help, but the author's current wife is against it due to past events. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if they're in the wrong (AITA?).\n\nSo the author is thinking of cutting the brother off, not helping. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, the brother didn't support him during a tough time, took his wife's side (who had a vendetta), and then cut contact. Now, even though the brother is in a similar situation, the author is hesitant to help because of past betrayal. The author's wife is also against it. \n\nOn one hand, maybe the author has valid reasons to not want to help after being wronged. On the other hand, family support is important, and maybe the author should be there regardless. But considering the brother's past behavior, perhaps the author is justified in protecting themselves. The brother did cut contact, so maybe the author isn't the one at fault here. The brother's wife's actions also played a role in the past issues. \n\nThe author did reach out when in need, and the brother didn't reciprocate. Now the tables are turned, and the author is choosing not to help. It's a bit of a cycle. The key points are the brother's previous lack of support and the current wife's influence. The author's decision might be seen as self-preservation rather than being in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong) because the author has been hurt before and is choosing to set boundaries. The brother's actions in the past were harmful, so the author isn't obligated to help now.\n"
