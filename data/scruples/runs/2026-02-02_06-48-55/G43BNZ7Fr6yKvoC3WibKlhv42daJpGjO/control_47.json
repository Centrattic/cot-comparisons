The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author were close, but the brother didn't support the author during their own messy divorce. The brother's wife spread lies, making him turn against the author. Later, when the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, the brother took her side, cutting off contact. Now, the brother is coming back asking for help after his wife also cheated.\n\nThe author's wife is against helping him, and the author is considering not responding. The key points here are past actions and the current situation. The brother wronged the author twice: once by not supporting him during his divorce and once by taking the sister-in-law's side. Now, the brother is in a similar situation but the author is hesitant to help.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong by not helping. From an ethical standpoint, while family support is generally expected, the brother has a history of betrayal. The author is not obligated to help someone who has consistently been harmful. The brother's actions were hurtful, and the author is justified in protecting their own well-being. \n\nThe author's wife is also against helping, which adds to the tension. The brother's delay in investigating the affair might suggest he wasn't paying attention, but that's not the main issue here. The main issue is whether the author must forgive past wrongs and assist despite the brother's previous behavior. \n\nIt's important to consider that people can make mistakes, but the brother's actions were significant and affected the author deeply. The author isn't required to reconcile or offer help if it's harmful to them. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to help.\n"
