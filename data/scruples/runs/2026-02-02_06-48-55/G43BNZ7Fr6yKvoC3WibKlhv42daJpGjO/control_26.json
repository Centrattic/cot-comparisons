The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they should help their brother who's going through a divorce now. The brother previously didn't support the author when they were going through their own divorce, and there's some history of conflict.\n\nFirst, the author's past: they had a messy divorce when they were 19, and asked their brother for help, but he didn't support them. The brother's wife was spreading lies, which might have influenced him. The author then married their current wife at 24, who supported them through the divorce. The brother later found out his wife was cheating but took her side when the author told him. Then they had no contact for two years. Now the brother is reaching out again, sorry for not believing the author before, and the author's wife doesn't want to help. The author is considering ignoring him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong if they don't help. Let's break down the key points:\n\n1. **Past Support Issues**: The brother didn't help when the author needed it during their divorce. This could justify the author's hesitation to help now. People often expect reciprocity in family support.\n\n2. **Brother's Mistreatment**: The brother's wife had a vendetta against the author, leading the brother to reject the author's help. The author's brother took the side of his wife despite the author's warnings. This might be a reason for the author to feel justified in not supporting him now.\n\n3. **Current Situation**: The brother is now going through a divorce he's partly responsible for not addressing earlier. The author's wife is against helping due to past issues. The author is considering ignoring him, possibly because of the prior lack of support and the brother's betrayal.\n\n4. **Emotional Impact**: The author has been hurt in the past, and the brother's actions caused significant strain on their relationship. The author might feel that not helping is a way to protect themselves from further emotional harm.\n\n5. **Moral Obligations**: While family ties can create expectations of support, there's also the argument that one isn't obligated to help someone who has wronged them. The brother's actions in the past might override any expectation of current support.\n\n6. **Potential for Reconciliation**: The brother is apologizing now. The author might need to decide whether to forgive and help, but there's no requirement to do so. However, completely cutting off any contact might be extreme, but the author might feel justified given the history.\n\nConsidering these points, the author's decision not to help could be seen as a self-protective measure after being wronged. The brother had a chance to support the author during their time of need and didn't, which could make the author's reluctance reasonable. Additionally, the brother took the side of an unfaithful wife, which shows a pattern of prioritizing others' interests over his brother's.\n\nHowever, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. But the depth of the brother's previous betrayal (taking sides against the author, spreading lies from his wife, ignoring the author's warnings) could make the author's stance understandable. The author's wife also supports not helping, suggesting that this decision is mutual and considered carefully.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to not help might be a way to set boundaries after being hurt, so they might not be in the wrong. The answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
