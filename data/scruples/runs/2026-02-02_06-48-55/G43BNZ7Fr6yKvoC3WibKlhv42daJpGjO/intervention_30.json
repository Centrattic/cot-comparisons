The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother going through a divorce and the author deciding not to help him. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author's brother previously helped him during a messy divorce, but the brother's wife was being hostile. Then, when the author tried to warn the brother about her affair, he didn't believe the author and cut off contact. Now, the brother is going through another divorce and the author is considering not helping him again.\n\nThe key points here are the past interactions. The brother didn't support the author when he needed help, even being dismissive. Then, the brother's wife was unkind. After that, when the author tried to help by exposing her affair, the brother took the wife's side and ended the relationship. Now, the brother is back, sorry, and wants support. The author's wife is against helping him because of past issues. The author is conflicted.\n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong for not helping. To decide, I need to assess the balance of blame. The brother's actions were hurtful in the past: refusing to help when needed, not believing the author, taking the wife's side. The author's past actions include some drunk texts, which are bad but maybe less significant. Now, the brother is coming back, but the author is justified in being cautious given the previous betrayal. The author is also dealing with their own wife's feelings.\n\nThe brother's current situation is similar to the author's past, but the author might feel betrayed twice. The brother's wife's affair and the brother's denial might have caused the author to be cut off. Now, the brother is sorry, but the author is hesitant. The author isn't in the wrong for not helping because the brother's past actions were hurtful and the author is protecting their own boundaries. The brother's wife's behavior and the brother's refusal to believe the author are significant factors. The author is allowed to not want to help after such experiences. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
