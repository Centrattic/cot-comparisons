The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The author's brother had previously not supported him during his own messy divorce and even took the side of the wife who was cheating. Now the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's wife is against it, and the author is considering cutting him off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The brother and author were close, but their relationship deteriorated after the author sought help during his own divorce and the brother refused, influenced by his wife. The author's brother later found out his wife was cheating but had taken her side then. Now, the brother is seeking reconciliation, but the author is hesitant due to past hurt.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. Let's consider both perspectives. On one hand, the brother's past actions were hurtful\u2014refusing support during a crisis and believing lies from his wife. The author has valid reasons to feel betrayed and might not want to help someone who caused them pain. On the other hand, they are family, and the brother is now in a similar situation, and there's a chance for reconciliation. The brother has apologized for not believing him before, so there's a shift in his stance now.\n\nThe author's wife is against helping, which adds complexity. The author is in a tough spot, balancing past grievances with familial obligations. However, the brother's previous behavior was indeed harmful, and the author's decision not to help could be seen as a way to protect themselves from further emotional harm. The author isn't in a clear wrong here because they've been wronged before. It's about self-respect and emotional boundaries. The brother's actions were selfish back then, and the author is justified in prioritizing their own well-being now. So the answer might be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
