The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong if they don't help their brother during his divorce. The brother previously didn't support them during their own divorce and took his wife's side when she was cheating. Now the brother is seeking help again.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author had a close relationship with their brother but it was damaged when the brother didn't support them during their messy divorce. The brother's wife spread lies, and the brother took her side. Later, when the brother found out his wife was cheating, he realized the author was right. Now, the brother is asking for help, but the author's current wife is against it because of past grievances.\n\nThe key points are the brother's past behavior\u2014being unsupportive when the author needed help, and taking his wife's side without evidence. The author is considering not helping now. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not assisting.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the brother's past actions were hurtful. The author might feel justified in not helping due to past betrayals. However, family support can be expected in some cultures, so there's a counterargument that the author should help despite past issues.\n\nBut considering the brother's actions were harmful and the author has already been through a tough time, maybe not helping isn't the wrong choice. The brother had a chance to support the author but didn't, so the author might be within their rights to say no now. Also, the brother's wife's affair was ongoing, which adds to the complexity. The author's decision to protect their own well-being and not let past hurts affect their current life could be seen as reasonable.\n\nSo, the answer would lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the brother's past behavior justifies the author's decision to not help now.\n"
