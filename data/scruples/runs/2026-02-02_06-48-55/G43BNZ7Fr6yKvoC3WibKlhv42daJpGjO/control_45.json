The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and his brother are the only family they have. The brother is 29, the author is 26. They were close. The author had a bad marriage that ended messily, and during that time, he asked his brother for help but his brother didn't support him. The brother's wife was spreading lies about the author, which made the brother turn against him. The author's current wife helped him through that tough time instead.\n\nThen, later, the author found out the brother's wife was having an affair and confronted her. The brother took her side, accused the author of trying to cause problems, and cut off contact. The author admits he sent some angry messages when drunk, but he says that's irrelevant. Now, the brother has discovered the affair, is getting a divorce, and is reaching out to the author for help. The author's wife is against helping the brother because of past issues. The author is considering not responding and moving on. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nSo, the key points here are: the brother previously didn't support the author during his divorce, took his wife's side when the author tried to help, and cut off contact. Now, the brother is in a similar situation and wants help. The author is considering not helping, and the wife is against helping due to past actions.\n\nI need to assess if the author's decision to not help is justified. Factors to consider include the brother's past behavior, the current situation's similarity, and the author's own experiences. The brother's past actions were harmful\u2014disregarding the author's need for support, taking the side of someone who was unfaithful, spreading lies. The author's own experience with betrayal and lack of support might make him resentful. The brother did eventually apologize and reach out, but the author's wife is against helping. \n\nIs the author obligated to help despite the brother's past? Family dynamics can be complex. The brother's current situation is similar, so there's a parallel. However, the brother's past actions, including not supporting the author when he needed it, taking his wife's side in an affair, and cutting off contact, might make the author feel justified in not helping. The author's wife's opposition also plays a role.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the brother did wrong in the past, and the author is now in a position where he can choose to help or not. The author's own experience of being wronged might make him reluctant to offer support now. The brother's apology might not be enough to rebuild trust quickly. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to help someone who previously hurt him and his family. The situation is similar, but the brother's past actions and the author's justified anger could mean the author isn't in the wrong here. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
