The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let's look at the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his brother were close. The brother didn't help the author during his own messy divorce, instead being dismissive and possibly influenced by his wife. The author then found out the brother's wife was cheating, but the brother took her side and cut off contact. Now the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's current wife is against it because of past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points are: past betrayal, lack of support from the brother when needed, and the brother's wife's deceit. The author is now choosing not to reciprocate help. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, family dynamics can be complex. The brother didn't support the author when he needed it, and there were personal vendettas involved. The author's decision to not help might be seen as a reaction to past hurt. But does that make them in the wrong? Maybe not, because people can set boundaries, especially after being wronged. However, there's a part where the author did text the brother's wife harshly when drunk. But the user says that's irrelevant. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother is now in need and apologizing. The author's current wife is against helping, but the author is considering not helping. Is there an obligation to help family regardless of past actions? It's a gray area. Some might argue the author isn't wrong for protecting themselves after being hurt. Others might say cutting off completely is harsh. But given the brother's past behavior, the author's choice might be justified. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
