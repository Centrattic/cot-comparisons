The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let me look at the details.\n\nFirst, the brother had a messy divorce before where the author asked for help and was rejected. The brother's wife was against the author, and the brother didn't support him. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, but when the author confronted them, the brother took her side and cut off contact. Now the brother is getting a divorce again and wants help, but the author's wife is against it due to past issues. The author is considering ignoring him.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are past actions. The brother previously didn't support the author during their divorce and took his wife's side against the author. The author also had some issues with the brother's wife, like texting her a slur when drunk. \n\nThe brother now is seeking help after his own divorce. The author is hesitant because of the past betrayal. The main factors here are the brother's previous lack of support and the author's reasons for not helping. The author's wife is also against it. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because the brother didn't support them when they needed help. People can set boundaries, especially after being wronged. The fact that the brother took his wife's side and cut contact is significant. The author isn't obligated to help someone who previously didn't support them. Also, the brother's wife had a vendetta, so the author's reluctance is understandable.\n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
