The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for choosing not to help their brother during his divorce. The situation is pretty complex. \n\nFirst, the brother and author were close, but their relationship has been strained over the years. The author went through a messy divorce five years ago and sought help from his brother, who didn't support him and was influenced by his wife's lies. The brother later had an affair himself, took his wife's side, and cut off contact. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again, but the author's wife is against helping due to past issues. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of conflict and the current situation. The brother's past behavior was hurtful\u2014denying support during a tough time, not believing the author, and then cutting off contact. The author's wife is against helping again, which is a valid concern given the brother's past actions. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. From a moral standpoint, family support is often expected, but there's also the aspect of self-preservation and past grievances. The brother's betrayal and the author's justified anger might make it reasonable for the author to feel they don't owe support. However, moving on with their life could be seen as cutting off a family member in need, which some might view as harsh.\n\nBut considering the brother's previous actions and the fact that he was inconsiderate when the author needed help, the author's decision not to help might be seen as a form of self-respect, not letting past hurt dictate their actions negatively. The brother's current situation is similar to the author's past, but since the brother didn't help before, it's a matter of fairness. \n\nThe author's wife's stance also plays a role here. They might have a valid reason to prioritize their current family's well-being over helping someone who has caused pain. So, there's a balance between family obligations and personal boundaries. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's a societal expectation to help family, the brother's past behavior and the author's justified resentment mean the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to help. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure there's no overlooked nuance. The text mentions the author called the brother's wife a \"cheating cunt\" when drunk, but the user says that's irrelevant. The main issue is the current decision not to help. So, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
