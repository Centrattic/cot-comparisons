The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the brother and author were close, but their relationship deteriorated after the author's divorce. The brother didn't support the author when they needed help, instead his wife spread lies. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, but the brother didn't believe him and cut off contact. Now the brother is seeking help again after his own divorce, but the author's wife is against it, and the author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the brother's past behavior was pretty bad\u2014abandoning the author when they needed support, taking his wife's side without evidence, cutting off contact. The author's wife is against helping, which is a valid reason. Also, the brother's wife cheated, and the brother didn't handle it well. The author's actions (texting the sister-in-law harsh things when drunk) were wrong, but maybe that's not the main point here.\n\nThe key is whether the author is obligated to help someone who wronged them. The brother's actions were hurtful, so the author might feel justified in not helping. However, family can complicate things. But given the brother's history, especially not supporting the author during a crisis, it's understandable the author would hesitate. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and their current wife's feelings. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
