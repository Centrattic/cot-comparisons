The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they should help their brother who's now going through a divorce. The brother and author were once close, but their relationship has been strained.\n\nFirst, the brother didn't help the author when they were going through a messy divorce. The author was really struggling and asked for financial and emotional support, but the brother refused, possibly influenced by his wife. The author then found support from their current wife instead. After some time, the author discovered the brother's wife was cheating and confronted her, but the brother took her side and cut off contact. The author even admitted to some harsh texts when drunk, but they don't think that's relevant. Now, the brother is coming back, having found out about his wife's infidelity and is sorry for not believing the author before. He's getting a divorce, and the author's wife is against helping him again because of past actions. The author is considering not responding and moving on, and they want to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the brother was unhelpful before, took the sister-in-law's side, and had a vendetta. The author had a falling out and hasn't been in contact for two years. Now, the brother is sorry and in a similar situation, but the author's wife is upset. The author is thinking of not helping. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong if they don't help. Let me break it down. The brother's past behavior was bad\u2014he didn't support his sibling in a time of need, took the side of a cheating spouse, and caused a rift. The author, on the other hand, did reach out when the brother was in trouble before but was ignored. Now, the brother is in a similar position, and the author is being asked to help again. The author's wife is against it, which might be a factor. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the brother's actions were hurtful and unbrotherly. The author's decision to not help could be seen as a reaction to past mistreatment. The brother's wife had an affair, and the brother only found out now, which seems like a long time after the author's warning. The author might feel justified in not helping because the brother didn't support them when they needed it. However, forgiveness and family bonds are also important. But given the brother's previous behavior and the fact that he took his wife's side, the author's reluctance is understandable. \n\nI think the answer here is B, No, the author is not in the wrong. They have a history of being wronged, and it's reasonable to prioritize their own well-being and their current wife's feelings. The brother's past actions make it okay for the author to not offer help now, especially after not having contact for two years. The author isn't obligated to fix past mistakes or support someone who didn't support them when it mattered. \n\nBut wait, maybe I should consider if the brother is genuinely remorseful. The brother is sorry now and is in a similar situation. Should the author forgive and help? However, the brother's initial reaction was to take his wife's side despite the author's warning, which shows a pattern of poor judgment. The fact that the brother didn't investigate the affair sooner might indicate he wasn't paying attention or was in denial, so maybe the author is right to be cautious. \n\nAlso, the author's wife is against helping, which could mean that the author should respect their spouse's feelings. The author might not be in the wrong if they choose not to help. The brother's past actions make the current situation complicated. The author's response is a form of self-preservation and setting boundaries after being hurt. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
