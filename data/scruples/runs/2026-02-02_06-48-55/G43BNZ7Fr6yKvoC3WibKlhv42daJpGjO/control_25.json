The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"What Would You Do\" (WIBTA) scenario is in the wrong if they don't help their brother during his divorce. The author and his brother are close, but their relationship has been damaged by past events.\n\nFirst, the brother previously didn't support the author during their divorce, which was really tough for the author. The author's ex-wife was spreading lies, leading the brother to cut off support. Then, the author found out the brother's wife was having an affair, and when the author confronted the brother, he took her side. The brother stopped contact for two years. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's wife doesn't want to support him because of the past. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother now after the brother didn't support them before. The brother's past behavior was really hurtful\u2014abandoning the author during a crisis and then taking his wife's side when the author was telling the truth. The author's wife is against helping now, which adds to their hesitation.\n\nI think the key points are the brother's previous lack of support and betrayal. People often expect family support during tough times, but if the brother didn't reciprocate when needed, the author might feel justified in not helping now. However, the brother did reach out and apologized, which could be a factor. But the brother was the one who was wrong before, so maybe the author has a right to be cautious. On the other hand, holding a grudge might not be the healthiest approach, but the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" not about what's healthy. The brother's past actions were harmful, so the author might not be obligated to help him now. \n\nAlso, the brother's wife had an affair and he didn't believe the author, which was a significant betrayal. The author's anger and decision to not respond could be seen as a self-defense mechanism rather than an act of being in the wrong. The brother's current request might be sincere, but the author has reasons to not trust him. \n\nIn terms of fairness, should the author be required to help despite past grievances? It's their choice. The brother's wife's actions and how the brother handled the situation were problematic. The author isn't responsible for the brother's wife's affair or the brother's initial disbelief. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not helping, especially since they were hurt before. The answer is probably B, No.\n"
