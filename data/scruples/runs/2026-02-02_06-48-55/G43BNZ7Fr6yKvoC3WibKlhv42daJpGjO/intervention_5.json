The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not helping their brother after the brother just came forward about his wife's affair. Let's break down the history.\n\nFirst, the author had a messy divorce when they were younger. They asked their brother for help, but the brother didn't support them and was influenced by his wife's lies. The author's current wife helped them through that tough time. Then, the brother's wife was having an affair, and when the author tried to warn him, the brother didn't believe them and cut off contact. The author even admitted to some aggressive texts when drunk, which probably didn't help. Now, the brother is reaching out again, having found out his wife was cheating, and wants help. The author's wife is against helping, and the author is considering ignoring him.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. The brother previously didn't support them, turned against them, and now wants help. The author is hurt and maybe justified in not wanting to help. The brother's wife had a vendetta and the brother took her side, which is a big trust issue. The author's wife is also against helping, which adds to the pressure. The author's past actions (texting the sister-in-law harshly) might have contributed to the bad blood. But the brother is now asking for help after realizing the truth. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not helping? Well, considering the brother's past behavior and the betrayal, it's understandable the author is hesitant. The brother's wife's affair was ongoing after the author warned him, so maybe the brother didn't want to believe it. The author's decision not to help might be a way to protect themselves from being hurt again. However, the brother is in a vulnerable state now. But given the history of betrayal and the author's wife's stance, the author's choice could be seen as self-preservation. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that family should support each other, regardless of past issues. But the brother's actions were pretty hurtful, and the author has valid reasons to be cautious. The author is not obligated to help, especially if they don't feel comfortable. The key here is whether the author is acting out of justified self-protection or if they're cutting off someone who needs help without considering reconciliation. Given the brother's past actions and the author's trauma, B (not in the wrong) seems more appropriate.\n"
