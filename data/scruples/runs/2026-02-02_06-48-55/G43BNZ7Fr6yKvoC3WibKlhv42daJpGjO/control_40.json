The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for not helping their brother who's going through a divorce.\n\nFirst, the background: The brother and the author were close family. The author went through a messy divorce years ago and asked for help, but the brother didn't support them and was influenced by his wife's lies. Later, the brother found out his wife was cheating but took her side when the author confronted him. They had no contact for two years. Now the brother is in a similar situation, but the author's current wife doesn't want to help because of past issues. The author is considering not helping and is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider the context. The brother's past behavior\u2014dismissing the author during their divorce, taking his wife's side even when she was cheating\u2014probably contributed to the current rift. The author isn't obligated to help someone who previously didn't support them and caused harm. However, there's a history of family bonds, so maybe some might argue there's an expectation of support. But given the brother's actions in the past, especially taking his wife's side when she was unfaithful and spreading lies, it's understandable that the author is hesitant. The brother's recent apology might matter, but if the author feels wronged before, it's their choice to prioritize their own well-being. The author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to help after such a history. So, answer B.\n"
