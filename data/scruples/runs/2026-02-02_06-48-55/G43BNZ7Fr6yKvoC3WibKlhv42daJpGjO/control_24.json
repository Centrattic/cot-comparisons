The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the brother previously helped the author during a messy divorce, but the brother's wife was hostile. Now the brother is going through a divorce again, and the author's current wife is against helping him. The author is considering not helping.\n\nThe key points here are the past interactions. The brother initially didn't help when the author was in a tough spot, which affected their relationship. Now the roles are kind of reversed. The author is hurt and maybe justified in not wanting to help after being let down before. But does that make them in the wrong?\n\nAlso, the brother's wife had an affair, and the brother took her side. The author confronted the sister-in-law and sent some angry texts when drunk. But the brother is now reaching out, sorry for not believing the author before. \n\nThe author's wife is against helping due to past issues. The author is considering cutting contact. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nIn terms of moral obligation, family can be complex. The brother's past actions were not supportive, so maybe the author isn't wrong for not helping now. The author has their own life and family to consider. The brother's wife's lies and the brother taking her side might have broken trust. So the author's decision not to help could be seen as self-preservation, not wrong. \n\nBut some might argue that family should support each other regardless. However, given the brother's previous behavior and lack of support, the author's choice not to help might be justified. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
