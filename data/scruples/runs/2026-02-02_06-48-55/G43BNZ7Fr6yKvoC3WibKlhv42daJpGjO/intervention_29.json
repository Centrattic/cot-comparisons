The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother after a divorce. The situation is complex with a history of conflict.\n\nFirst, the brother's past behavior: he didn't support the author during their messy divorce, which led to the author considering suicide. Then, when the author confronted the brother's wife about an affair, the brother took her side and cut off contact. The brother's wife had a vendetta against the author, which might explain his initial lack of support.\n\nNow, the brother is getting a divorce again and wants help, but the author's current wife is against it. The author is considering not helping. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe author's reasons for not helping include past betrayal and the brother taking his wife's side. The brother did apologize for not believing the author before. However, the author also admits to sending angry texts when drunk, which adds some fault on their part.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, family obligations can be a gray area. The brother's past behavior was hurtful and unsupported, which justifies the author's hesitation. The brother's current request comes after a history of not being reliable. The author's wife's opposition is also a factor, as they are a unit now. The author isn't obligated to help someone who previously harmed them, especially if trust is broken. The brother's apology might not be enough to rebuild that trust.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to help. They have valid reasons based on past experiences. So the answer is B.\n"
