The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, the brother and author were very close, but their relationship soured after the author's divorce. The brother didn't support the author during their tough time, instead being influenced by his wife's lies. Then, when the brother found out his wife was cheating, he took her side and cut off the author. Now, the brother is seeking help again after his wife cheated in the same way, but the author's current wife is against helping.\n\nThe key points here are the history of betrayal and the lack of support from the brother in the past. The author had a valid reason to be hurt, especially since the brother didn't believe them during a critical time. The brother's wife also spread lies, which added to the conflict. Now, the brother is asking for help after a similar situation, which might be seen as a repeat of past issues. The author is considering not helping, given the past experiences and their wife's stance.\n\nIt's important to consider the context of their relationship. If the brother was untrustworthy and unsupportive before, the author might have justified being cautious now. The brother's actions in the past could have broken trust, making it reasonable for the author to distance themselves. Also, the brother's wife's deceitful behavior plays a role here. The author isn't obligated to help someone who previously didn't support them and took sides against them.\n\nHowever, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. But in this case, the brother's actions were harmful and he took the side of the cheating wife, which is a significant factor. The author's decision to not help could be seen as self-preservation rather than being in the wrong.\n\nSo, weighing the past betrayals and the brother's lack of support, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to help now. Their decision is influenced by justified hurt and a desire to protect themselves from further emotional harm.\n"
