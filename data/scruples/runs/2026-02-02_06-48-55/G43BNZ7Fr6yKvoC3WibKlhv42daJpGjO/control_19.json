The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering not helping their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, let me break down the story. The author and his brother are the only family they have. The author had a troubled marriage that ended in a messy divorce when he was 19. He asked his brother for help, but the brother (then married) didn't support him, possibly influenced by his wife. The brother later found out his wife was cheating but didn't believe the author when he tried to warn him. Now the brother is going through a divorce himself and is asking for help, but the author's wife is against helping him because of past issues.\n\nThe author is considering not helping. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider the context. The brother previously didn't support the author during his tough time and took his wife's side against the author. Now the brother is in a similar situation. The author might feel justified in not helping because of past betrayal. \n\nHowever, family relationships can be complex. Even if the brother was wrong before, cutting off or not helping might have its own consequences. But the author's wife is against helping, and the brother's wife had a history of lying. The author might have valid reasons to protect himself, especially if he's been hurt before. \n\nThe brother's actions in the past were hurtful, and the author might feel that the brother didn't support him when it mattered. The author's decision to not help now could be seen as a reaction to that lack of support. On the other hand, some might argue that helping family in need is important regardless of past issues. \n\nBut considering the brother's past behavior\u2014taking his wife's side without investigating, spreading lies, the affair that the author warned about\u2014it's possible the brother wasn't acting in good faith before. The author might have learned from that and is now protecting himself. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not helping. He's responding to a history of betrayal and not wanting to be taken advantage of again. The brother's current request might be genuine, but the author's experience justifies his hesitation. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
