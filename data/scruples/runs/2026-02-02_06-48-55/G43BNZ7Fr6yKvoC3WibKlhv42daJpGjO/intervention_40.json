The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The brother previously didn't support the author during their own divorce and took his wife's side when the author confronted her about an affair. Now, the brother is reaching out for help after discovering the same affair and his wife's infidelity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their past interactions. The brother didn't support the author when they needed help, which caused a significant rift. The author's wife is against helping the brother now because of past events. The author is contemplating not responding. \n\nThe key points here are the history of betrayal and lack of support from the brother. The brother's actions in the past\u2014turning against the author and taking his wife's side\u2014could justify the author's decision to not help him now. However, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. But given the brother's previous behavior, the author might feel justified in protecting themselves from further emotional and financial strain. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but based on the brother's history, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong. The decision to not help could be seen as a form of self-preservation. The brother's current request comes after a long period of no contact and past harm. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
