The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping his brother during his divorce. The author, who's 26, had a close relationship with his older brother, 29. Their relationship was strained after the author's messy divorce when the brother didn't support him and was influenced by his wife's lies. The brother later had an affair, and when the author tried to warn him, he was disbelieved and cut off. Now the brother is seeking help again after discovering the affair, but the author's wife is against it due to past issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the brothers. The author felt betrayed when his brother didn't help during his own divorce, which led to a breakdown in their relationship. The brother's wife was a factor, spreading lies and creating a vendetta. Then, when the brother was in trouble, the author tried to help but was dismissed. Now the brother is coming back, but the author is hesitant because of past hurt.\n\nThe key points here are past betrayals, the brother's previous lack of support, and the wife's role in poisoning the brother's mind. The author's current hesitation is understandable given the history. The brother's actions\u2014disregarding the author's warnings and cutting him off\u2014show a lack of trust and support when it mattered. Now, expecting the author to help without acknowledging his past pain might be unfair.\n\nAlso, the author's wife is against helping, which adds another layer. The author is in a tough spot, balancing his own emotional history with his brother's current needs. The brother's realization that his wife was cheating and his apology come after significant damage. The author might feel justified in not helping, especially after being let down before. \n\nHowever, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. But given the brother's actions and the betrayal, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The brother's previous behavior and the wife's interference played a big role in the estrangement. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to help.\n"
