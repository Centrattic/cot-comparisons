The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong if they don't help their brother during his divorce. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author and his brother are the only family they have. The author is 26, brother is 29. They were close before. The author had a bad divorce at 19, which was messy. He asked his brother for help, but the brother didn't support him, partly because the brother's wife spread lies. The author then married his current wife, who supported him. The brother found out his wife was cheating but took her side, leading to a 2-year break in contact.\n\nNow the brother is getting a divorce again, same affair with the same guy. He's asking for help, but the author's wife is against it due to past issues. The author is considering not helping. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the brother had previously not supported the author and then took his wife's side. On the other hand, they are family, and maybe helping is expected. However, the brother has a history of being toxic and not trustworthy. The author is justified in being cautious, especially since his wife is against helping. Also, the brother's wife had a vendetta and the brother believed her lies. The author's past actions (texts when drunk) might not be relevant if he's apologized or it's in the past.\n\nThe key points are the brother's past behavior and the author's right to prioritize his own well-being and his wife's feelings. The brother is now seeking help after being untrustworthy. The author isn't obligated to help, especially after the brother's previous actions. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But need to check if there's any obligation to help family regardless. However, no one is required to help someone who has been harmful. The author's wife's opposition is also a factor. So I think the answer is B.\n"
