The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The question is whether the author should help their brother during his divorce, considering past events.\n\nFirst, let me break down the situation. The author and his brother were close, but their relationship deteriorated due to past conflicts. The author went through a messy divorce and asked for help, but the brother didn't support him, influenced by his wife's lies. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was having an affair, and the brother took her side, cutting off contact. Now the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's wife is against it. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of betrayal and the current situation. The author was wronged in the past by the brother's lack of support. The brother then took his wife's side when she cheated, which is a significant betrayal. Now the brother is asking for help, but the author has valid reasons to be hurt and distrustful.\n\nI need to assess if the author is in the wrong for not helping. The brother's past behavior was harmful, and the author had to go through a tough time without support. The author's current stance could be seen as self-preservation. However, family dynamics can be complex. But given that the brother also cut off contact and was unfaithful, the author might feel justified in not helping. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The brother's actions were harmful, so the author's reluctance is understandable. The author isn't obligated to help someone who has wronged them before. So the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But I have to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. The brother is now asking for help, but the author has reasons to be cautious. The author's wife is also against it, which adds another layer. The author's actions (texting the sister-in-law when drunk) might reflect poorly, but the user says that's irrelevant. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their well-being after past betrayals. So the answer is B.\n"
