The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, the brother had a history of not helping when the author needed support during his own messy divorce. The brother's wife was spreading lies and he took her side against the author. Then, when the brother later realizes his wife was cheating and wants to reconcile, the author's wife is against helping him. The author is considering not helping.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is, but I need to evaluate.\n\nFactors to consider: Past actions of the brother, the brother's wife's role, the author's own experiences, and the current situation. The brother didn't support the author when he needed it, took his wife's side without evidence, and cut off contact. The author now has a valid reason to be cautious, especially after being betrayed before. The brother's wife's past behavior (cheating, lies) might affect the author's trust. The author's wife is against helping, which adds another layer. The author's decision to not help could be seen as self-protective after previous betrayal. However, family obligations might argue against it. But given the brother's history, the author's stance is understandable. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
