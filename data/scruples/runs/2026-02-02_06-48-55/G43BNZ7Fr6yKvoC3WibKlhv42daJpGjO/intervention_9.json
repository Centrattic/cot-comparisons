The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author were close, but their relationship soured. The author's first marriage was unhappy, and when they asked for help from their brother, he didn't support them and even turned against them, influenced by his wife. The author then had a better marriage, found love again, and moved on. Later, the brother discovered his wife's affair, realized he was wrong about the author's earlier warnings, and now wants help, but the author's current wife is against it. The author is considering cutting ties again.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's past behavior: he didn't help when the author needed support, took his wife's side, and cut off the author. Now, after realizing his mistake, he's asking for help. The author is conflicted. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping now.\n\nConsidering the brother's past actions\u2014being unsupportive, not believing the author, and cutting off contact\u2014there's a history of betrayal. The author might feel hurt and not want to help someone who didn't support them during a vulnerable time. The brother's wife also had a vendetta and contributed to the bad relationship. The author's current wife is against helping, which adds another layer.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about boundaries and trust. The author has the right to set boundaries after being wronged. Helping might open the door for further issues, especially with the brother's wife's history. However, the brother is now seeking help, showing remorse. The author might be within their rights to not help, given the past. Alternatively, forgiveness could be an option, but it's not required.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's decision is justified given the brother's past. Since the brother didn't support them when needed and the author has valid reasons for not wanting to help now, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. It's a complex situation with valid perspectives on both sides, but the author's choice to protect themselves isn't wrong. Answer B (not in the wrong) makes sense here.\n"
