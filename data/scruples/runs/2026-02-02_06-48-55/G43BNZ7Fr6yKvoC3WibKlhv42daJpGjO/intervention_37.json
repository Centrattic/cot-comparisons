The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong for not helping their brother who's going through a divorce. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author and their brother are close, but the brother didn't help the author during their messy divorce. The author's then-wife supported them. Later, the brother found out his wife was cheating, but he took her side when the author confronted him. The brother ended the relationship, and they haven't spoken in two years. Now the brother is getting a divorce and asks for help, but the author's wife is against it because of past issues. The author is considering ignoring him and wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nThe options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). The user initially thought the author might be wrong but is curious about others' opinions.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the brother's past behavior. The author was in a tough spot before and the brother didn't support them. Then, when the author tried to warn about the brother's wife cheating, he didn't believe them and cut off contact. Now the brother is in a similar situation and wants help. The author is hesitant because of the past betrayal and their wife's advice.\n\nI need to consider if the author is obligated to help despite the brother's past. Family dynamics can be complex. The brother's actions were hurtful: not supporting during a crisis and disbelieving the author. The author might feel justified in not wanting to help someone who didn't support them and who took their side against them. \n\nBut then, is there a moral obligation to help family regardless of past issues? Some might argue that family should support each other, but others might say that past behavior matters. The brother also admitted fault later, but the damage was done. The author's wife is against helping, which adds another layer. \n\nThe author's actions of texting the brother's wife when drunk were poor, but they're saying that's irrelevant now. However, that shows the tension between them. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. But given the brother's history of not helping and cutting ties, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for not helping now. The brother's actions might have contributed to the author's decision. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
