The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and their brother were very close, but their relationship deteriorated after a series of events. The author went through a messy divorce and asked for help, but the brother didn't support them, influenced by his wife's lies. Later, the author discovered the brother's wife was cheating, but when they confronted the brother, he took her side and cut off contact. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and wants support, but the author's current wife is against helping due to past issues. The author is considering not helping and is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are past grievances and the current decision to not help. The brother's past behavior\u2014supporting his wife's lies and cutting off the author\u2014seems to have caused a lot of hurt. The author's actions in the past (texting the sister-in-law vulgar messages when drunk) might have worsened things, but they admit that's irrelevant now. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not helping now. The brother is starting to realize his wife's infidelity, but he was dismissive before. The author's wife is against helping because of past hurt. The author is torn between moving on and helping despite the history.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. Family obligations can be complex. The author might feel justified in not helping due to past betrayal and lack of support. However, maybe they could consider some support without being obligated, given the brother's current situation. But the author's current wife's stance and their own experiences might make them hesitant. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's refusal is based on justified self-preservation or holding a grudge. Given the brother's past actions and the author's own history of being unsupported, the author might not be in the wrong for choosing not to help. Alternatively, some might argue that family should support each other regardless. But considering the context, the author has valid reasons for their decision.\n"
