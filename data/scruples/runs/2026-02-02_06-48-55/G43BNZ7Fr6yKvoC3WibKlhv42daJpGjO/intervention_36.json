The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is the younger brother (26) who went through a bad marriage and divorce. He had a close relationship with his older brother (29), but things fell apart when the brother didn't support him during his divorce. The brother's wife was spreading lies, which caused the brother to turn against him. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, and when he confronted them, the brother took her side. The author then cut off contact for two years. Now, the brother is seeking help again after discovering his wife's ongoing affair.\n\nThe key points here are the history of strained relationships, mutual blame, and current decision-making. The author's wife doesn't want to help the brother due to past issues. The author is considering not helping. The user asks if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the brother's past behavior\u2014supporting his wife's lies and taking her side when the author was trying to warn him\u2014could be seen as a betrayal. The author might feel justified in not wanting to help someone who previously turned against him without investigation. However, the brother is now seeking reconciliation, acknowledging his past mistakes, and is in a difficult situation due to the affair.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's retaliation with drunk texts might have worsened the relationship. But the brother's wife's deceit likely played a role in the initial breakdown. The author's decision not to help could be seen as self-preservation, especially considering the brother's past actions and the wife's current infidelity. However, family support can be important, so the author might feel obligated to help despite the past.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. The answer depends on whether the brother's actions were unforgivable and if the author feels no responsibility. Given the brother's past betrayal and the wife's persistent deceit, the author's decision to cut contact and not help might be understandable. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
