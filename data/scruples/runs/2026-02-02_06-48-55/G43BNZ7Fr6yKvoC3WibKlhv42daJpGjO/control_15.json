The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the author should help their brother who's going through a divorce now. The brother and the author were close until the author's own divorce a while back, when the brother didn't support them. Then later, the brother's wife was having an affair, and the brother took her side. Now the brother is getting a divorce and wants help, but the author is hesitant because of past experiences.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The author's brother previously rejected their help during a difficult time, which made the relationship worse. The brother's wife was spreading lies and had a vendetta against the author. Then, when the brother's wife cheated, he took her side, leading to a complete breakdown in their relationship. The brother apologized and is now seeking help again, but the author is considering not helping.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. The brother's past behavior was pretty bad\u2014abandoning his brother when he needed support and taking his wife's side during an affair. The author had valid reasons to feel hurt and betrayed. The brother's wife's actions also contributed to the conflict. The author's decision to not help might stem from justified anger and a desire to protect themselves from further hurt. Since the brother has been the one to cause past harm, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries now. Relationships require mutual support, and if someone cuts you off and takes your partner's side during an affair, it's reasonable to not want to help them without some reconciliation or accountability first. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
