The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the person should help their brother who's going through a divorce, given their past issues.\n\nFirst, the author had a messy divorce years ago and asked their brother for help, but the brother didn't support them. The brother's wife was spreading lies, and the brother ended up taking her side. This led to a broken relationship. Then, when the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, the author confronted her, and the brother turned against the author, cutting off contact. Now, the brother is getting a divorce from his wife, and the author's wife is against helping him. The author is considering not helping and moving on. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the past interactions. The brother didn't help the author during a crisis, took the side of his wife who was spreading lies and later cheating, and cut off contact. The author did have some harsh messages when drunk, but the brother was the one who didn't support them before. Now the brother is in a similar situation, but the author's wife is opposed to helping. The author is thinking of not helping back.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the brother wronged the author in the past, it's not necessarily the author's fault to reciprocate. People often have boundaries, especially after betrayal. The author's wife is against helping, which adds another layer. The brother's actions hurt the author, so the author might feel justified in not helping. However, some might argue that helping family is important regardless of past issues.\n\nBut given that the brother didn't support the author during a tough time and took the side of the cheating wife, the author might not be in the wrong for not helping now. The brother's actions were harmful, so the author's decision to move on is a choice based on past experiences. The author isn't obligated to help someone who wronged them. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if the author's actions (like the drunk texts) were unkind, maybe that's a factor, but the main issue is the brother's previous behavior. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
