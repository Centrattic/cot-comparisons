The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether the author should help their brother during his divorce. The brother and author were close, but their relationship deteriorated because of past issues. \n\nFirst, the author had a bad divorce and asked the brother for help, but the brother didn't support him. The brother was influenced by his wife, who had a vendetta. The author then had a better marriage and supported through their own divorce. Later, the brother's wife cheated, and when the author told him, the brother didn't believe him and cut off contact. Now the brother is divorcing the cheater, and the author's wife is against helping him again. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong if they don't help? Let's break it down.\n\nThe brother's past behavior: He didn't help when the author needed support during a tough time. He took his wife's side over his brother. Now, the author's current wife is against helping, which makes sense given the history. The brother is asking for help now, but the author might be justified in not wanting to help after being let down before. \n\nBut the brother is now in a similar situation. The author might feel the brother doesn't deserve help because of past actions. However, family can be complex. The brother is sorry and wants help now. But the brother's wife had a history of betrayal, and the brother didn't support the author before. \n\nThe author's wife is against helping, perhaps because of the past betrayal. The author is considering not helping. The author was wronged before, so maybe they're not in the wrong now. The brother's actions in the past were harmful, so the author's reluctance is understandable. \n\nI think the key points are the brother's previous lack of support and the ongoing resentment. The author isn't obligated to help someone who wronged them. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The author isn't at fault for not helping after the brother's past behavior.\n"
