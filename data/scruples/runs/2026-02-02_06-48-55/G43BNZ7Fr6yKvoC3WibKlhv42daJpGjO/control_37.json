The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complex with a history of conflicts.\n\nFirst, the brother and sister were close, but their relationship soured after the author's first divorce. The brother didn't help the author back then, and his wife spread lies against the author. The author then found out the brother's wife was cheating, confronted her, but the brother took her side. This led to a two-year estrangement. Now, the brother is going through a divorce himself and is asking for help, but the author's current wife is against it due to past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of betrayal, lack of support from the brother when the author needed it, and the brother taking his wife's side over the author. The author's wife's opposition is also a factor. The brother's current request for help comes after he's realized his wife was cheating, but it's unclear if the author's decision to not help is justified.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, family dynamics often involve expectations of support, but when there's a history of harm and betrayal, it's reasonable for someone to set boundaries. The brother's past actions\u2014abandoning the author when they needed help and taking his wife's side when the author was trying to warn him\u2014could justify the author's reluctance. The author's wife's stance also plays a role, as marital support is important.\n\nHowever, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. But considering the brother's betrayal and the lack of support when the author was in need, the author's decision not to help might not be in the wrong. The brother's actions contributed to the strained relationship, so the author isn't obligated to help now. The key is whether the author's choice is a reasonable response to the brother's past behavior. Given that, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
