The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is pretty complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the brothers were close. The author had a bad divorce at 19, got help from his wife, but his brother didn't support him and even turned against him due to his wife's lies. Then later, the brother's wife cheated, he took her side, cut off the author. Now the brother is apologizing, getting a divorce, but the author's current wife wants to help him. The author is considering not helping again.\n\nSo, the key points here: past issues between the brothers, betrayal from both sides. The brother was a jerk before, and now he's asking for help. The author is hurt and wants to move on. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping.\n\nThe user is looking for a judgment call here. In these kinds of situations, people often consider whether there's been reconciliation, if the past actions are forgiven, and if there's any obligation to help despite past conflicts. The brother's previous behavior was pretty bad\u2014taking his wife's side when she cheated, cutting off the author. The author might feel justified in not wanting to help again, especially if trust is broken. On the other hand, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues.\n\nBut looking at the details, the brother was the one who wronged the author twice. First by not supporting him during his divorce and then by taking his wife's side when she cheated. The author is now in a position where he's considering not helping, and the sister-in-law is against it. But the author's current wife supported him through his tough time, so their relationship is stable. The brother's actions have caused a lot of hurt, so maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. The brother needs to take responsibility for his past actions. The author isn't obligated to help someone who has wronged them, especially without an apology or effort to make amends. The brother only reached out after his own situation mirrored the author's, which could be seen as self-serving.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author has valid reasons for not wanting to help after being betrayed twice. Helping shouldn't be expected if there's no trust or reconciliation.\n"
