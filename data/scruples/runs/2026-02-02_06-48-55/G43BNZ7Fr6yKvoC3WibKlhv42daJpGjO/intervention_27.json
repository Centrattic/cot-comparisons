The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated. The author and their brother used to be close, but there's a lot of history between them. \n\nFirst, the author's brother didn't help him during his messy divorce. The brother's wife spread lies and made him cut off the author. Then, years later, the author finds out the brother's wife was cheating. The brother takes her side, accuses the author of causing problems, and cuts off contact. Now, the brother is going through another divorce because of the same affair, and the author is considering not helping him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. Let's break it down. The brother wronged the author by not supporting him during his time of need and then cutting him off. The author was in a vulnerable position, and the brother's actions were hurtful. Now, when the brother is in a similar situation, the author might feel justified in not helping because of past grievances.\n\nBut wait, the brother is now reaching out, and the author's wife is against helping. The author is considering ignoring him. Is that fair? Well, past actions can affect current decisions. If someone has wronged you, it's reasonable to set boundaries. However, sometimes forgiving and helping can be a choice. But the brother didn't support the author when he needed help, and even took his wife's side against him. The author might be within their rights to not reciprocate the help now.\n\nAlso, the brother's wife did spread lies and have an affair. The brother's initial trust in her over the author shows a lack of support. The author's decision not to help now could be seen as a defensive measure, protecting themselves from further harm. The brother's actions were hurtful, so the author isn't obligated to help now. It's about mutual respect and trust. Since the brother didn't support the author when it mattered, the author might not feel the need to help now. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
