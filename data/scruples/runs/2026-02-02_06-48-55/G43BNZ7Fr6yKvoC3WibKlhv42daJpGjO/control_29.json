The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, the background: The author and their brother were close. The author had a bad divorce years ago and asked the brother for help, but the brother didn't support them and was influenced by his wife. Later, the brother's wife had an affair, and when the author told him, the brother took her side and cut off contact. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's current wife doesn't want to help due to past issues. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are past betrayals. The brother didn't support the author when they needed help, took the unfaithful wife's side, and this caused a rift. Now the brother is asking for help after his own infidelity. The author is hesitant because of the history. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, especially family, mutual support is important. However, if there's been betrayal or harm in the past, people might feel justified in not helping. The brother's previous actions were hurtful. The author's decision not to help might be a way to set boundaries after being wronged before. \n\nAlso, the brother's wife had a vendetta and lied, which the brother believed. The author tried to help by confronting the affair but was rejected. Now the brother is realizing the truth too late. The author's wife is against helping, so there's added pressure. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. Family obligations can be complex. The author isn't obligated to help if they feel hurt and wronged previously. The brother's past behavior could justify the author's hesitation. So, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to help given the history. But maybe some would say family should support each other regardless. However, considering the betrayal and lack of support before, the author's choice is understandable.\n"
