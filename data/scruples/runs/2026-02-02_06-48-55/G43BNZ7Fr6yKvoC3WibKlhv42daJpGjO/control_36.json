The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother and author were close, but their relationship soured after the author's messy divorce. The brother didn't support the author at the time, and even took the brother's wife's side when the author confronted her about infidelity. The brother then cut off contact for two years. Now, the brother is reaching out again because his wife is cheating with the same guy, and he's sorry he didn't believe the author before. The author's current wife is against helping, and the author is considering ignoring him again.\n\nSo, the main points here are past grievances and the brother's current request. The brother previously didn't support the author and took his wife's side, which caused a rift. Now, the brother is admitting fault and seeking help. The author is hesitant because of past hurts and their wife's advice.\n\nI need to assess whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. The brother's past behavior was hurtful, especially when he didn't support the author during a tough time. However, he's now reaching out, showing remorse. The author might feel justified in not helping due to the previous betrayal and ongoing family tension. The brother's wife's actions also played a role in the past conflict, and the brother initially didn't believe the author's warnings.\n\nOn the other hand, family is important, and the brother is in a similar situation. But the author's decision to not help could be seen as self-preservation, especially after being wronged before. The author's wife's stance might influence this decision, but the author has the right to prioritize their own well-being after past trauma.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They've been hurt before and might not have the energy or trust to support their brother despite his apology. The brother's initial betrayal is significant, and the author is within their rights to choose to move on. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
