The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they should help their brother who's going through a divorce now. The brother previously didn't support the author during their own messy divorce, and there was a falling out that led to no contact for two years. The author's current wife is against helping him, given the past.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the history. The brother didn't help when the author was in a crisis, which is significant. The author's brother took his wife's side when the author was trying to warn him about her affair. That's a major betrayal. Then the brother cut off contact. So the author has valid reasons for feeling hurt and not wanting to help now.\n\nThe brother just came back, admitting he was wrong and that the wife was cheating. The author is considering not responding. The key here is whether the brother's past actions justify the author not helping now. The author's wife is against helping, which makes sense given the history. The author's reasons for not helping seem to stem from the brother's previous betrayal and the lack of support during a tough time. \n\nThe author also mentions they were very close before, but the relationship deteriorated because of the brother's actions. The brother's wife was spreading lies, and the brother believed her over his own sibling. That's pretty serious. Now the brother is asking for help, but after a long time of no contact, the author might feel there's no obligation to help now. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether the author is obligated to help despite the past. The author isn't in the wrong because they were wronged before, and the brother didn't support them when they needed it. The author's decision to not help now could be seen as self-preservation and protecting their own well-being, especially considering their wife's stance. The brother's actions in the past were harmful, so the author isn't the one at fault here for not wanting to help after being let down.\n"
