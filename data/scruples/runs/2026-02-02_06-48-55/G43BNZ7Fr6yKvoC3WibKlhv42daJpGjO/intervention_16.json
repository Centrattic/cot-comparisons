The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's brother is going through a divorce again, and the author is considering not helping him, which is causing some conflict.\n\nFirst, let me recap the story. The author and his brother were close. The author had a bad divorce when he was 19, and his brother didn't support him, even saying \"get fucked\" and being influenced by his brother's wife. The brother's wife had a vendetta against the author. After that, the relationship became distant. Later, the brother found out his wife was cheating, but he took her side when the author tried to warn him. The brother cut contact with the author. Now, the brother is going through another affair, and he's sorry and wants help, but the author's current wife doesn't want to help because of past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nThe user thinks the author might be in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. Let's break down the key points.\n\nThe brother's past actions: He didn't support his brother during his divorce, took his wife's side when warned about her infidelity, and cut contact. This shows a lack of support and possibly betrayal.\n\nThe author's past actions: He did text the sister-in-law some angry messages when drunk, which might be a point against him, but he admits it's irrelevant. Also, he's considering not helping now.\n\nNow, the brother is seeking reconciliation. The author has a valid reason to be upset about the past hurts. The brother's wife was against the author, and the brother didn't believe the author when he tried to help. The author's wife is against helping again because of past issues. The author is in a position where he might feel wronged and is choosing to move on.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, family relationships can be complex. The author has been through a lot of betrayal and lack of support. The brother's actions were hurtful. Choosing not to help now could be seen as self-preservation. The author isn't obligated to help someone who has wronged him, especially if the relationship is toxic. However, some might argue that family should support each other regardless. But given the circumstances, the author's decision is understandable. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
