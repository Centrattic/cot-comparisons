The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the brother and author were close, but their relationship changed after the author's messy divorce. The brother didn't help the author when they needed support, which affected their relationship. Then, the brother's wife cheated, and he took her side, cutting off contact with the author for two years. The author did make some mistakes, like calling the sister-in-law a \"cheating cunt\" when drunk, but the brother is now reaching out for help after his own divorce.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's past actions: not supporting the author during a crisis, taking the cheating wife's side, and cutting off contact. The author is now considering not helping back, especially since their wife is against it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping.\n\nThe brother's previous behavior was pretty hurtful and unsupportive. Betrayal and lack of support during tough times can really damage trust. The author has a right to feel hurt and might not want to help someone who didn't help them when they needed it most. The brother's wife's affair was a major issue, but the brother's response was to take her side, which shows poor judgment. Now, the brother is asking for support after his own divorce, but given his past actions, the author's reluctance makes sense.\n\nThe author isn't obligated to help, especially if the relationship has been irreparably damaged. The brother's initial betrayal and failure to support the author could justify the author's decision to not help. The author's wife is also against helping, which might reinforce their decision. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because the brother's past actions provide a valid reason for the author's decision.\n"
