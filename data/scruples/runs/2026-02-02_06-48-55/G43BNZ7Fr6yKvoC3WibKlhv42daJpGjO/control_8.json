The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is pretty complex with a lot of back and forth between the siblings.\n\nFirst, the brother (the author) had a messy divorce when he was younger. He asked his older brother for help, but his brother, influenced by his wife, turned him down and was even hostile. This caused a rift between them. Later, the older brother found out his wife was cheating, but when confronted, he didn't believe the author and cut ties. The author then had some angry messages to the sister-in-law when drunk, which he admits were irrelevant. Now, the older brother is getting a divorce again and wants help, but the author's wife is against it because of past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. Let's consider their relationship history. The older brother didn't support the author during his time of need, took his wife's side, and didn't believe him. Now, the author is being asked to help despite the older brother's past actions. The author's wife is also against it, which adds another layer.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, there's a history of betrayal and lack of support. The older brother's wife was actively spreading lies and there was an affair. The author has valid reasons to be cautious. The older brother's actions in the past caused significant harm. The author isn't obligated to help someone who didn't support them when they needed it most, especially when there's been betrayal and a breakdown in trust.\n\nHowever, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. But given the extent of the older brother's actions\u2014turning against his brother, taking his wife's side, and the author's own experience of being unsupported\u2014it's understandable that the author is hesitant. The author also mentions that the older brother only reached out after realizing his wife was cheating, which might be a genuine change of heart, but the author is justified in being cautious.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while it's noble to help family, it's not a requirement, especially when there's a history of harm. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and that of their current wife. The older brother's past actions make it reasonable for the author to choose not to help without guilt.\n"
