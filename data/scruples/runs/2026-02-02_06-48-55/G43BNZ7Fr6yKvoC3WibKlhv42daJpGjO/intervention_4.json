The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the brother had a messy divorce and asked for help, but the author's brother didn't support him, possibly influenced by his wife. Then later, the brother found out his wife was cheating, took her side when the author confronted her, cutting off contact. Now the brother is going through another divorce and wants help, but the author's wife is against it because of past issues.\n\nThe author is considering not helping. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The brother wasn't supportive when the author was in trouble, took his wife's side, and cut off contact. The author might feel justified in not helping now, especially after the betrayal. However, the brother is now in a similar situation, and maybe forgiveness is expected. But family dynamics can be complicated. The author's wife is against helping, which adds another layer. \n\nThe key points are the brother's past behavior: being unsupportive, taking his wife's side, and cutting ties. The author might feel resentment. The brother apologized for not believing him. But the author might not owe them help after that. The brother's wife had a vendetta, but the author is now being asked to help despite the past. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They were hurt before, and the brother's actions were harmful. It's reasonable to prioritize their own well-being and not help someone who didn't support them when they needed it. So answer B.\n"
