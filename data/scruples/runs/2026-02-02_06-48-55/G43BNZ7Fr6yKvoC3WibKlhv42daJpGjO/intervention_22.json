The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the brother and author were close, but the brother didn't help the author during their own messy divorce. The brother's wife was spreading lies, so maybe that's why he didn't support the author. Then, when the author found out about the brother's wife's affair, the brother took her side, cutting off contact. Now, the brother is reaching out again because he's going through a divorce, but the author's wife is against helping. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The brother wronged the author by not supporting them during their time of need. Then took the sister-in-law's side, leading to a two-year silence. Now, the brother is apologizing, but the author is hesitant to help again. The key points here are past betrayals and the author's justification for not helping. The brother's actions were hurtful, so the author might feel justified in not helping. On the other hand, maybe there's still a duty to help family. But given the history, the author's decision not to help might not be in the wrong. The answer might be B, but I need to consider both sides carefully.\n"
