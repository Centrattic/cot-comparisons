The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the WIBTA post) is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, the background: The brother and author were close but had some major issues. The author had a failed marriage and asked the brother for help, which the brother refused, possibly influenced by the brother's wife. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, but the brother took her side. They haven't spoken in two years. Now the brother is getting a divorce and wants help, but the author's wife doesn't want to support him due to past actions. The author is considering cutting off contact.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, family dynamics can be complex. The brother's past actions\u2014refusing help when the author needed it and taking his wife's side when she cheated\u2014probably caused a lot of pain. The author might feel justified in not helping now, especially if there's no trust left. On the other hand, the brother is now in a similar situation, and maybe there's a chance for reconciliation. But the author's wife is against it, and the brother's wife was unfaithful again. The author's texts calling her a \"cheating cunt\" when drunk might have added to the tension, but the user says that's irrelevant. \n\nThe key points are past betrayals and lack of support. If the brother didn't help before and the author is now choosing not to reciprocate, maybe it's about fairness. But family is supposed to support each other. However, if the brother was actively harmful and untrustworthy, the author might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being. The author's wife's stance is also a factor here. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (Not in the wrong) because of the brother's past behavior and the author's valid reasons for not wanting to help now. The brother's actions were selfish, so the author isn't obligated to support him after so much time and betrayal.\n"
