The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let me start by understanding the context.\n\nFirst, the brothers were close, but their relationship has been strained over time. The author had a failed marriage at 19 and asked his brother for help, but the brother refused, influenced by his wife. This led to a rift. Later, the brother discovered his wife was cheating but didn't believe the author when he warned him. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's current wife is against it due to past issues.\n\nThe author is considering not helping. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the brother previously didn't support the author during his divorce and took sides against him. The author's wife is also against helping. The author might feel justified in not helping due to past betrayal. Also, the brother's wife had a vendetta and the brother took her side, which is a valid reason for the author's hesitation.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother is now seeking help, and maybe there's an opportunity to mend the relationship. The brother did reach out and apologized. The author might feel that helping is the right thing despite past issues. However, the brother's past behavior was harmful, and the author isn't obligated to help if he feels it's not in his best interest.\n\nThe key points here are trust and past actions. The brother's wife's vendetta and his siding with her caused significant pain. The author might not want to repeat the cycle by helping now without assurance of trust. The author's wife's opposition also plays a role, as they need to consider their own family's well-being.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while family support is important, there's no legal obligation. Emotionally, the author has valid reasons to be cautious. The brother's past actions don't guarantee he'll be truthful this time. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own emotional and financial health, especially after being hurt before. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
