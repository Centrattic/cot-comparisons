The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the author's brother going through a divorce and the author considering not helping him, given past conflicts.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a messy divorce seven years ago and asked his brother for help but was rejected. His brother's wife was involved in spreading lies, which created a rift. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, and when he confronted them, the brother took her side. They lost contact. Now, the brother is getting a divorce and wants help, but the author's wife is against it because of past issues. The author is thinking of not helping and is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author's brother was unsupportive during his time of need and even took his wife's side when she cheated. The author had a history of being wronged by the brother. Now, the brother is in a similar situation but the author is hesitant to help. \n\nIs it fair for the author to hold past grievances? The brother's actions were hurtful and unsupportive, so the author's reluctance is understandable. However, family can be complicated. The brother is now in need, and the author might be holding a grudge. On the other hand, the brother admitted fault and apologized. The author might feel justified in not helping due to past betrayal. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. If the brother was unhelpful before, maybe the author isn't obligated to help now. But maybe cutting off all help is too harsh. The author's wife is against it, which adds another layer. The author is considering moving on without helping. \n\nIn the context of AITA (Am I the Asshole?), the community often considers intentions and fairness. The author was wronged in the past, and the brother's actions were clearly in the wrong. The current situation is the brother seeking help after causing past harm. The author isn't required to be a martyr. If the brother was a bad friend before, the author isn't in the wrong for not being supportive now. The author's decision not to help isn't necessarily wrong given the history. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any expectation of family support regardless of past issues. However, the brother's past behavior was toxic. The author isn't obligated to help someone who didn't support them in their time of need. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
