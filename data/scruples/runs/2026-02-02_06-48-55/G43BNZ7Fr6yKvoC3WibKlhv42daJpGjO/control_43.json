The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether the author should help their brother during his divorce. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author and his brother were close, but their relationship deteriorated after the author's first messy divorce. The brother didn't help the author back then and even took his wife's side when the author confronted them about her affair. The brother then cut off contact. Now, the brother is going through a divorce himself and wants help, but the wife is against it because of past issues. The author is considering not helping and is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is at fault for not helping now. Let's look at the brother's past behavior. He didn't support the author during their divorce, which was a tough time. Then, when the author found out about the brother's wife's affair, the brother took her side and cut off contact. That seems pretty hurtful and unforgiving. The author did text the brother's wife some harsh messages when drunk, but they consider that irrelevant. \n\nNow, the brother is asking for help. The author's wife is against it, given the brother's past actions. The brother admitted he was wrong before and is now going through a similar situation. But the author is considering not helping because of the brother's past betrayal. \n\nFrom the brother's side, he did admit to being wrong and is seeking help now. However, the author has valid reasons for not wanting to help, especially since the brother didn't support them when needed. The brother's actions in the past were harmful, and the author might feel justified in not helping now. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of family. Even if the brother was in the wrong before, maybe the author should consider helping now as a way to rebuild the relationship. However, given the brother's previous behavior and the fact that he took his wife's side, the author might feel it's not a good idea to offer support without some form of reconciliation or proof of change.\n\nThe author's decision to not help might be seen as self-preservation, especially after being hurt. The brother's past actions could have eroded trust, making it hard for the author to just forgive and help. On the other hand, the brother is now in a similar situation, which might be a chance for mutual support. But if the brother had taken his wife's side before, maybe the author is right to be cautious.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have reasons to not want to help, given the brother's past behavior and the fact that the brother's wife was against the author. The author's wife's disapproval also plays a role. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
