The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother who's going through a divorce. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author were really close. The author went through a bad divorce earlier, and when they asked for help, the brother didn't support them and even took sides against them. The brother's wife was spreading lies, and when the author caught the brother's wife cheating, he didn't believe them. The brother cut off contact after that. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and is reaching out for help, but the author's wife is against it because of past issues. The author is considering ignoring their brother.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The brother was very unsupportive during the author's time of need. He took the side of his wife who was cheating and even accused the author of causing problems. That's pretty hurtful. Now, the brother is asking for help. The author is being asked if they should help despite the past betrayal.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were cut off and betrayed. The brother's actions caused a lot of pain. The author's wife is also against helping. It's understandable that the author might not want to help someone who didn't support them when they needed it. The brother's wife's actions and his support of her were harmful. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a case for forgiveness or helping family regardless. But given the brother's past behavior, it's not clear if he was genuinely sorry. He might be asking for help now because he's in a similar situation. The author might feel justified in protecting themselves and not helping someone who wronged them. \n\nThe brother's timing is questionable\u2014he took so long to realize his wife was cheating. That could indicate he wasn't paying attention, and now he's asking for help. The author might feel it's a way to get back at them for not helping before. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries after being hurt. The brother's past actions were harmful, so the author's decision to not help might be a way to protect their own well-being. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
