The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the WIBTA question) is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and his brother were very close. The author had a bad divorce at 19, and when he asked for help from his brother, the brother didn't support him. The brother's wife was spreading lies, but the brother still turned against the author. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, but the brother didn't believe him and cut off contact. Now, the brother has discovered his wife's affair and wants help, but the author's current wife is against helping due to past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are past betrayals, broken trust, and the brother initially not supporting the author. The author is now hesitant to help back. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping.\n\nIn WIBTA questions, the community often considers intent, communication, and whether there's been an attempt to make amends. The brother did reach out and apologized, but the author has reasons to be cautious. The brother's wife was manipulative before, and the author's wife is against helping. The author might feel betrayed and hurt from past actions. \n\nThe brother's actions in the past (not helping during the author's divorce and taking his wife's side) are significant. The author is not obligated to help someone who has wronged them. The fact that the brother is only reaching out now might be seen as self-serving, especially if he's only realizing the truth now. The author has the right to prioritize their own well-being and family's feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would probably be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have valid reasons for not helping due to past harm and current family dynamics.\n"
