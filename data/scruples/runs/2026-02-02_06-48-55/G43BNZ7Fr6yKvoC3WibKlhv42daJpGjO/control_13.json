The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA question is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brothers are close, but there's a history of conflict. The author had a problematic divorce years ago and asked for help, but the brother didn't support him. Then later, the brother's wife was having an affair, and when the author told him, the brother didn't believe him and cut off contact. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's current wife is against it. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points are past interactions. The brother previously didn't support the author, then the brother's wife had an affair and the brother took her side. The author did text the sister-in-law some harsh messages when drunk, but considers it irrelevant. Now, the brother is sorry and wants help, but the author is hesitant because of past experiences.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong to not help now. The author has been wronged before, and the brother's wife was part of the problem. The brother took her side and cut off the author. Now, the brother is seeking reconciliation. The author's wife doesn't want to help because of past issues. \n\nI think the author isn't obligated to help, especially given the history. The brother didn't support them when they needed it, and the brother's wife was toxic. The author's decision not to help might be justified as self-protection. However, some might argue that even with past issues, family should support each other. But considering the brother's previous actions and the fact that the author was also a victim, it's more about the balance of fairness. The brother's current request isn't without context of past harm. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
