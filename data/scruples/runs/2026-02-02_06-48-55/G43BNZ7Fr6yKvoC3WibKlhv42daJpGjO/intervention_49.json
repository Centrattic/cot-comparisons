The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The brother and the author were close family, the only family they have. The author had a messy divorce at 19, and when they asked their brother for help, he refused and supported their ex-wife. The author had to rely on their current wife, who was supportive. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was cheating and confronted her, but the brother didn't believe them and cut off contact. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again, and the author's wife is against helping him because of past issues. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the past interactions between the author and their brother. The author was in a tough spot during their own divorce and asked for help, but the brother turned them away. Then, the author discovered the brother's wife was cheating and confronted her, but the brother took her side. This led to a two-year estrangement. Now, the brother is back, having realized the infidelity and is getting a divorce, but the author is thinking of not helping again.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong to not help now. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nI have to consider the moral dimensions here. The brother was unresponsive during the author's time of need, which could affect the author's willingness to help. The author's texts to the brother's wife when drunk might be a point, but they say it's irrelevant. The current wife is against helping because of what happened before.\n\nThe author's stance is about moving on and not helping, possibly due to past hurt. The brother apologized and is in a similar situation now, but the author is considering not helping. The brother's past behavior (not supporting when needed, taking ex-wife's side) is a big factor. The author might feel betrayed and not trust their brother's sincerity now. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about whether the author has a responsibility to help despite the brother's past. Some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. Others might say that the brother's previous actions justify the author's decision not to help. \n\nThe brother's wife had a vendetta against the author, which the brother believed without checking. The author helped uncover the affair, but the brother didn't listen. Now the brother is sorry. The author might feel justified in not helping because the brother didn't support them before, and the wife's actions were harmful. \n\nBut the brother is now in a similar situation. The author could argue that the brother's past behavior makes it hard to trust them. The wife's opposition is another layer. The author's own mental health during their divorce was severely affected. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is obligated to help despite the brother's past. Since the brother wronged the author before, the author might not be in the wrong for not helping now. They have the right to protect themselves from further hurt, especially if the brother didn't support them when they needed it most. The brother's apology might not be enough to rebuild trust quickly. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
