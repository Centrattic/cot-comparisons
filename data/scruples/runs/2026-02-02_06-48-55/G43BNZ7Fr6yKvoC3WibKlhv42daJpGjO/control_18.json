The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering not helping their brother during his divorce, given their complicated history.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the timeline and relationships. The brother and author were close, but their relationship deteriorated when the author's first marriage was going through a messy divorce. The brother didn't support him, and the brother's wife was spreading lies. Later, when the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, the brother took her side and cut off contact. Now the brother has come back, admitting he was wrong before, and wants help, but the author's current wife is against it. The author is considering cutting him off again.\n\nThe key points here are the past support (or lack thereof) from the brother, the betrayal by the brother's wife, and the recent apology. The author is conflicted because they want to move on but are hurt from past actions. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether there's an obligation to help family despite past issues. The brother initially didn't help in a time of need, took his wife's side when the author was trying to help, and then cut contact. Now, the brother is seeking help after being wronged by his wife, but the author is hesitant due to past experiences. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to be taken advantage of again. They had valid reasons to be hurt and distrustful. The brother's previous actions were harmful, and the author has a right to prioritize their own well-being. The wife's objection adds another layer, but the decision here is about the author's responsibility. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). They aren't obligated to help someone who previously didn't support them and caused emotional harm. The situation involves personal boundaries and healing, so the author's choice to not help isn't a mistake in this context.\n"
