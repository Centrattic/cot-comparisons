The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author were very close. The author went through a messy divorce and asked for help, but the brother didn't support him and was influenced by his wife's lies. Later, the brother's wife cheated, and he took her side, cutting off the author. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's current wife is against it because of past issues.\n\nThe author is considering not helping. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants to know. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The brother did wrong before by not supporting the author and taking the wife's side. The author has reasons to be hesitant, given the past betrayal. The brother's wife cheated again, which adds to the tension. The author's wife is also against helping, which might influence the decision.\n\nBut does the author have a duty to help regardless? Family obligations can be tricky. However, the brother's past behavior was harmful. The author might feel justified in protecting their own family's well-being and not helping someone who wronged them. \n\nThe brother apologized, but the author's wife is still hesitant. The author is caught between past grievances and possible reconciliation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not black and white. The brother's actions were definitely wrong before. The author's decision to not help could be seen as self-preservation after being wronged. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that family should support each other regardless. \n\nConsidering the context, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the brother had a history of betrayal, and the author is protecting their own family's interests.\n"
