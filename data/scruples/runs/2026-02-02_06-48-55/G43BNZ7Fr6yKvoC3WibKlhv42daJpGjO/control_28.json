The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they don't help their brother during his divorce. The situation is complex with a history of strained relationships.\n\nFirst, the brother previously didn't support the author during their divorce, which was really tough. The brother's wife was spreading lies and he took her side. Then, the brother found out his wife was cheating and now wants help, but the author's current wife is against it. The brother just apologized for not believing the author before.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author has a history of being let down by their brother, especially during a vulnerable time. The brother's past actions\u2014disbelieving the author, taking his wife's side\u2014might have justified the author's hesitation. The brother's wife also had an affair, and the brother didn't act on the author's warnings. Now the brother is seeking help after being in the wrong before.\n\nThe key points are the past betrayal, the brother's failure to support the author when needed, and the current wife's opposition. The author might feel justified in not helping due to the history. There's no legal obligation here, just family. The brother's apology might not erase the past actions, especially if the author still feels hurt. \n\nAlso, the author was in a bad mental state before and didn't get support. The brother's wife's actions (cheating, lies) play a role in the strained relationship. The author's decision to not help again might be a self-protective measure. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They've had valid reasons for their past actions and current hesitation. The brother's past behavior and the wife's interference are significant factors. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
