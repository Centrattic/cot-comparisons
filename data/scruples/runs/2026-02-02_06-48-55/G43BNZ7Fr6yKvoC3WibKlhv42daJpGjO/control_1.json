The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complex with a history of strained relationships.\n\nFirst, the brother previously didn't support the author during their own divorce, which was really hard. The author's brother's wife was spreading lies, leading the brother to cut off support. The author then got through the divorce with their now-wife's help. After that, the brother found out his wife was cheating but took her side, leading to a complete breakdown in the relationship. The brother and author haven't spoken in two years. Now, the brother is reaching out because he's going through his own divorce, but the author's wife is against helping him given past issues.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author in the wrong if they don't help now? Well, the brother's actions in the past were pretty hurtful. He didn't support the author when they needed it most, even after the author tried to warn him about his wife's infidelity. The author's wife is also against helping, which adds another layer. The author might feel justified in not helping because of the past betrayal. However, family dynamics can be complicated. But in this case, the brother's previous behavior was not supportive, and the author has reasons to be cautious. The author isn't obligated to help, especially after the brother didn't support them and took his wife's side. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to help after the brother's past actions.\n"
