The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the brothers are close, but their relationship has been strained. The author had a failed marriage and asked for help, but the brother didn't support him, influenced by his wife's lies. Then the author found out the brother's wife was having an affair, but the brother took her side. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's current wife doesn't want to help because of past grievances. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of betrayal and the current situation. The brother previously didn't support the author during their divorce, took the wife's side, and now the author is hesitant to reciprocate. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not helping.\n\nI need to consider if there's an obligation to help family despite past issues. On one hand, family support is important. On the other hand, the brother was unsupportive and took the wife's side, which caused a rift. The author's wife is against helping, which adds another layer.\n\nThe author might feel justified in not helping due to past actions. However, there's a counterpoint that maybe forgiveness and support are important. But considering the brother's previous behavior, the author might be protecting themselves from further harm. \n\nI think it's a judgment call. The brother's past actions were hurtful, so the author not wanting to help isn't necessarily wrong. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they've been wronged before and are setting boundaries. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
