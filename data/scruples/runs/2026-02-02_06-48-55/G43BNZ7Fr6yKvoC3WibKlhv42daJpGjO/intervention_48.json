The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author were close. The author had a bad divorce earlier, and when he asked for help, the brother didn't support him and even took his wife's side. The brother's wife spread lies about the author. After that, the brother cut off contact. Now, the brother is going through his own divorce, same guy the author warned him about years ago. He's asking for help, but the author's current wife doesn't want to help because of past issues. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the answer could go either way. Let's break it down.\n\nFactors to consider: The brother wronged the author before by not supporting him during his divorce and taking his wife's side. The brother's wife was having an affair, and the brother didn't believe the author. Now, the brother is in a similar situation. The author's wife is against helping because of past hurt. The author might feel justified in not helping due to past betrayal. However, family support is often expected, even after conflicts. \n\nOn one hand, the brother is asking for help now, and maybe the author should forgive past issues. On the other hand, the brother didn't help before and was unkind. The author's previous support could have made a difference, but the brother didn't reciprocate. The author might be protecting themselves from more hurt. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is obligated to help despite the brother's past behavior. If the brother wronged the author, the author might feel they have a right to set boundaries. However, if the author is choosing not to help out of spite or holding a grudge, that could be seen as wrong. \n\nThe author mentions that their wife is \"violently opposed\" to helping, which might influence the decision. But the question is about the author's actions, not the wife's. The author's motivation is important. If it's about protecting themselves or focusing on their own family, maybe it's not in the wrong. If it's about revenge, then maybe they are. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the balance between family obligations and past wrongs. Since the brother didn't support the author when needed, the author might not be in the wrong for not helping now. However, some might argue that family should support each other regardless. But given the context of betrayal, it's understandable. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
