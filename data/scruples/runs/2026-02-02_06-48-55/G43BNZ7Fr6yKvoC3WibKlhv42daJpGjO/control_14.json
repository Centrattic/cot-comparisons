The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complex with a history of strained relationships.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author were close, but their relationship was damaged when the author's first marriage ended. The brother didn't support the author back then, which caused a rift. Then, the author found out about the brother's wife's affair but he took her side, leading to no contact for two years. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's current wife is against it due to past actions. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down. The brother previously didn't support the author during a tough time and then took the wife's side in the affair. The author's current wife is against helping because of past events. The brother's wife also spread lies about the author. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, while family support is important, past actions can affect current decisions. The brother's wife's behavior might have contributed to the tension. The author might feel justified in not helping due to the brother's past support and his wife's lies. However, some might argue that cutting off because of past issues isn't fair. But considering the brother's actions and the wife's role, the author might feel it's self-preservation. \n\nThe author also admitted to sending angry texts when drunk, but the context is that the brother took his wife's side. The brother's lack of support before and his wife's betrayal could be valid reasons for not helping now. The author's wife is against helping, so it's a mutual decision. \n\nI think the key points are mutual betrayal and the brother's previous lack of support. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
