The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author is the brother who's been through a lot. First, he had a bad marriage that ended messily, which led to a breakdown. He asked his older brother for help but was rejected. Then, his brother later found out his wife was cheating, took her side, and cut off contact. Now, the brother is divorcing her again and asking for help, but the author's current wife is against it because of past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to figure out if that's accurate. Let's look at the key points. The author's brother didn't help when he needed support during his first divorce and even took his wife's side when she cheated. That's pretty harsh. Then the brother ignored him for two years. Now, the brother is reaching out again, but the author's wife is upset because of past actions. The author has some anger from being wronged before, like the wife spreading lies and the brother taking her side.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for not helping now? Well, the brother previously didn't support him when he was in a vulnerable position. The author might have valid reasons to feel hurt and not want to help, especially given the history. On the other hand, maybe there's a moral obligation as family. But the brother's past actions were pretty harmful. The author's wife is against helping, which adds to the conflict. \n\nI think the key here is the brother's past behavior. If someone wrongs you and then you're expected to help them without considering your own feelings, that's a tough ask. The author isn't obligated to help someone who hurt him, especially since their relationship was broken for two years. However, maybe there's some responsibility as family. But given the context, the author's decision not to help isn't necessarily the wrong choice. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
