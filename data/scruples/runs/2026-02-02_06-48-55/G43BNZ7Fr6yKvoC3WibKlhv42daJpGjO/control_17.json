The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether the author should help their brother who's going through a divorce. The brother previously didn't support the author during their own messy divorce, which was really tough for the author and even led to thoughts of suicide. The brother's wife was spreading lies, and the brother took her side. Then later, when the author found out about the brother's wife cheating, the brother didn't believe the author and cut off contact. Now, the brother is reaching out again, having realized his wife was cheating, and the author is considering not helping.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The brother was there for the author in a bad time but then turned against them, taking his wife's side. The author had a breakdown and needed support, which the brother didn't provide. Now, the brother is in a similar situation, and the author is hesitant to help because of past betrayal.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's previous actions. He didn't support the author during their crisis, took his wife's side when she was unfaithful, and cut off the relationship. The author is now being asked to help again, but given the brother's history of not being there, is it wrong for the author to choose not to help?\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The author's decision to not help might be influenced by the brother's past behavior. If someone wrongs you before, it's reasonable to protect yourself from being taken advantage of again. The brother was dismissive and unhelpful when the author needed him, so the author might not feel obligated to reciprocate now.\n\nAlso, the author's wife is against helping the brother, which adds to the pressure. The brother's wife was involved in spreading lies and cheating, which complicates the relationship. The author's feelings of betrayal could justify not wanting to help, especially if there's no indication that the brother has changed or deserves trust.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. But the brother's actions were quite severe\u2014abandoning his brother during a crisis and taking his wife's side despite clear evidence of infidelity. The author's decision to not help might be a way to set boundaries after being hurt before.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to help. The brother's past behavior justifies the author's hesitation. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
