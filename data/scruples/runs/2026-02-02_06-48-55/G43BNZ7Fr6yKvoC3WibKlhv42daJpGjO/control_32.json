The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be A Twat) question is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother going through a divorce and the author considering not helping him, given past issues.\n\nFirst, the author and his brother were close. The author had a failed marriage early on, which was messy and led to considering suicide. He asked his brother for help, but the brother was uncooperative, influenced by his wife. Later, the author discovered the brother's wife was cheating, and he confronted them, but the brother took her side, leading to a two-year fallout. Now the brother is reaching out, apologizing for not believing the author before, and the author's wife is against helping due to past experiences. The author is contemplating not responding.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the brother's previous lack of support during the author's crisis, taking his wife's side when the author warned him about the affair, and now the brother is seeking support after his own divorce. The author is being asked if he's in the wrong for not helping now.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user wants a straightforward answer based on the situation.\n\nThe brother initially didn't support the author when needed, even though the author was in a dire situation. The brother's wife spread lies, and he didn't believe the author. Now the brother is in a similar situation, but the author's wife is against helping because of past betrayal. The author is considering not responding, which could be seen as cutting off contact after the brother's previous behavior.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, family support is often expected, but the brother's past actions were harmful. The author has valid reasons to be hurt and not want to help, especially given the wife's stance. The brother's timing might seem opportunistic, but he is now seeking help after realizing his mistake. However, the author isn't obligated to help if they feel wronged. The brother's previous behavior might have broken trust, making the author's decision understandable.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not responding. The brother's past actions were unkind, and the author is within his rights to prioritize his own well-being and his wife's feelings. The answer should be B.\n"
