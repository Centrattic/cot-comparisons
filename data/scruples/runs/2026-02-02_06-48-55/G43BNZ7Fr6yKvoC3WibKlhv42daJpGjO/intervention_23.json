The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the brother and author were close, but their relationship deteriorated. The author had a messy divorce and asked for help, but the brother refused. The brother's wife was spreading lies, which the author was unaware of. Later, the brother found out his wife was cheating and now wants help, but the author's wife is against it because of past issues. The author is considering cutting ties again.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The brother initially didn't support the author during their divorce, even when the author was in a crisis. Then, when the brother is in trouble, the author is hesitant to help due to past trauma and their wife's opposition. The author did reach out to the brother's wife in a drunk state, which isn't great, but the brother had already cut ties.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for not helping now? Well, the brother was unsupportive when the author needed help. The author's decision to not respond might be a result of justified hurt. However, family dynamics are tricky. Even though the brother had his own issues, the author's actions in the past (texting the sister-in-law) were poor, but that was in the past. \n\nThe main question is forgiveness and moving on. The author might feel betrayed and not want to be taken advantage of again. The brother's wife was part of the problem before. The author's wife is against helping, which adds pressure. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being after being hurt. The brother's past behavior might have damaged trust. Therefore, the answer might be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
