The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for considering not helping their brother during his divorce. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author were very close, being the only family they had. The author went through a bad divorce when they were younger and asked for help, but the brother didn't support them. The brother's wife spread lies and influenced him, leading to a breakdown in their relationship. Over time, they weren't as close. Then, the brother's wife cheated, and when the author told him, he didn't believe them, took her side, and cut off contact. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again, sorry for past actions, and the author's wife is against helping him. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points are past actions affecting current decisions. The brother's previous lack of support and betrayal might influence the author's hesitation. The author's wife's feelings about the brother's ex-wife's affair also play a role. The question is whether the author is wrong to not help.\n\nThe brother apologized and is now in a similar situation. But the author has been hurt before. People often respond to past betrayals by protecting themselves. The author isn't obligated to help if they feel wronged. The brother did take sides against them before, so maybe the author is justified in not helping. However, some might argue that forgiveness and support are important. But given the history of the brother's actions and the current wife's opposition, the author's decision might be seen as self-preservation. So, probably not in the wrong.\n"
