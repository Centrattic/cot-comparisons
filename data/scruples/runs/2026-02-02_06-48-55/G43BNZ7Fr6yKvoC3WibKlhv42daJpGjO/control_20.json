The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, the background: The author and their brother were close, but their relationship deteriorated after the author's first divorce. The brother didn't support the author then, and later took his wife's side when she cheated. They lost contact. Now the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's current wife doesn't want to help because of past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nLooking at the situation, the brother didn't support the author during their tough time, then took the wife's side when she cheated. The author was betrayed and hurt. Now the brother is asking for help after being unhelpful before. The author's wife is against helping, which adds pressure.\n\nThe brother did admit he was wrong by taking his wife's side and is seeking reconciliation. However, the author has valid reasons for not wanting to help, given the past. The brother's previous actions caused harm, so the author might feel justified in not extending help now. \n\nBut is there an obligation to help family regardless? Some might argue that family should support each other, but others would say that past betrayals can affect current decisions. The author was the one who was wronged first, so not helping might be seen as self-preservation. \n\nConsidering that the brother was the one who cut off contact and was unhelpful before, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not helping now. The fact that the brother's wife was unkind and he was manipulated adds context. The author's decision to not help could be a way to protect themselves from further hurt. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
