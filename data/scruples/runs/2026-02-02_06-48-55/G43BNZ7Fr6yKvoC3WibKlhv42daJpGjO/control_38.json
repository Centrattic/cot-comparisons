The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. Let's look at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the brother and author were close. The author went through a messy divorce and asked for help, but the brother didn't support them. The brother's wife spread lies, causing the rift. Later, the brother found out his wife was cheating but had taken her side when the author warned him. Now, he's seeking help again, but the author's wife is against it due to past issues.\n\nThe key points here are past actions and current motivations. The brother's previous betrayal is significant. He didn't support the author in their time of need and even turned against them. The author's wife is against helping now because of that history. The author is considering cutting ties again. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not helping? Well, family dynamics can be complex. The brother's past behavior was harmful. The author isn't obligated to help someone who previously wronged them, especially if it's causing emotional strain. The brother might deserve support, but the author isn't the one to provide it after all that. So, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing their own peace and not helping.\n"
