The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author were close but had a falling out. The author went through a messy divorce and asked for help, but the brother didn't support him and was influenced by his wife's lies. Later, the brother found out his wife was cheating but didn't believe the author when he warned him. Now the brother is reaching out for help, but the author's current wife is against it because of past issues.\n\nSo, the author is considering not helping. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both perspectives. The brother wronged the author by not supporting him during his divorce and taking his wife's side. However, the author might have acted poorly by texting the sister-in-law harshly when drunk. But that's described as irrelevant by the author. \n\nThe brother did eventually realize his mistake and is now seeking help. But the author has reasons to be cautious, especially after the previous betrayal. The author's wife is also against helping, which adds to the conflict. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the brother's past behavior was harmful, so the author isn't obligated to help. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and family's wishes. Plus, the brother didn't support the author when needed. So, the author's decision to not help isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
