The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether it's wrong for them not to help their brother during his divorce. Let me break down the details from the story.\n\nFirst, the author and his brother are each other's only family. The brother is 29, the author is 26. They were really close. The author had a messy divorce when they were 19, which was tough. They asked the brother for help, but he didn't support them and even took his wife's side, which led to a breakdown in their relationship. The author then married their current wife, who supported them through that time. Later, the author found out the brother's wife was cheating and confronted her, but the brother didn't believe him and cut off contact. The author admitted to sending some angry texts when drunk, but that's probably not relevant now. Now, the brother has a change of heart, realized his wife was cheating (same guy), and is getting a divorce. The author's current wife is against helping, and the author is considering not helping again. The question is if the author is in the wrong for not responding.\n\nSo, the brother previously failed to support the author during a crisis, took his wife's side, and cut off contact. The author helped the brother out in the past, but the brother didn't reciprocate when the author needed support. Now the brother is reaching out, but the author is hesitant because of past hurt. The author's wife is also against helping, which adds another layer.\n\nI think the key points here are the brother's past behavior and the author's justified anger. The brother didn't support the author during a difficult time and even turned against him. The author might feel that their brother was unreliable and hurtful, so not helping now isn't wrong. The brother's wife was unfaithful, and he only realized it after the author warned him, which adds to the brother's poor judgment. The author's decision not to help could be seen as self-preservation rather than being in the wrong. The brother's initial betrayal and the author's own support from their current wife might make the author's choice reasonable. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
