The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is at fault if they choose not to help their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his brother were close, but their relationship deteriorated after the author's first divorce. The brother didn't help the author then, and later, when the author found out the brother's wife was cheating, the brother didn't believe him and cut ties. Now the brother is going through his own divorce and wants help, but the author's current wife is against it because of past issues. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if that makes them the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are the history between the brothers. The brother didn't support the author when they needed help, and then took his wife's side when confronted about her affair. The author also had some angry texts when drunk, but that's considered irrelevant by them. Now, the brother is seeking help after realizing his wife's infidelity. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while family support is often expected, there's also consideration for past wrongs. The brother didn't support the author when needed, and there was betrayal. The author might feel justified in not helping given the history. However, some might argue that family should support each other regardless of past issues. But considering the brother's previous actions and the lack of trust, the author's decision could be seen as self-preservation rather than being in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the author's wife is against helping, which adds another layer. The author might be under pressure from their spouse. The brother's wife had a vendetta and lied, which the brother believed, leading to the author being cut off. The author's anger in texts, though, might show some fault, but they dismiss it as irrelevant. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the brother's past behavior and the lack of support when the author needed it most could justify the author not helping now. The brother's realization and apology might be sincere, but the author is not obligated to forgive or assist. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to help after being wronged in the past. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
