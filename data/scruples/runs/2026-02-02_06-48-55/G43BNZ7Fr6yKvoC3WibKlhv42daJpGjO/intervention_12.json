The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The scenario is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the brother and author were close, but past issues caused a rift. The author went through a failed marriage and sought help but was rejected by his brother, who was influenced by his wife. Later, the brother discovered his wife was cheating but had previously taken her side against the author. Now, the brother wants help, but the author's wife is against it due to past grievances. The author is considering not helping and wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of conflict and betrayal. The author had a hard time and was let down by their brother. Then the brother took his wife's side when she was cheating. Now the brother is seeking help, but the author is hesitant because of past hurts. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, family support is important. On the other, there's a history of betrayal and the brother didn't support the author when they needed it. The author's wife is also against helping, which adds another layer. \n\nThe author's feelings of betrayal might justify not wanting to help. People can set boundaries after being hurt, especially if the other person wasn't there for them. However, some might argue that helping family is a moral obligation despite past issues. \n\nI think it's a judgment call. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have valid reasons to be cautious. The brother's past actions (disbelieving and cutting off the author) and the current wife's stance could justify the author's decision to not help. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
