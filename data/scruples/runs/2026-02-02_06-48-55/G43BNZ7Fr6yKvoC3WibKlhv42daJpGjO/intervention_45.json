The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce.\n\nFirst, the brother had previously helped the author during their own messy divorce. The author went to their brother for support, both financial and emotional, but the brother didn't help, which caused a rift. Then, years later, when the brother realizes his wife was cheating (as the author had warned him), he reaches out for help, but the author's current wife is against it due to past issues.\n\nThe key points here are the brother's past betrayal and the author's justified resentment. The author's brother didn't support them when needed, took his wife's side, and cut off contact. Now the author is considering not helping back, which could be seen as holding a grudge. However, the brother's actions were harmful, and the author's decision might be a way to protect themselves from further hurt.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the brother wronged the author first, then the author's response might be a form of self-preservation. But there's also a moral obligation to family, especially when the brother is in a similar situation. However, given the brother's history of betrayal and the fact that he previously didn't support the author, the author's decision not to help could be justified as a boundary.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the brother's past actions were harmful, and it's reasonable for the author to prioritize their own well-being. The brother didn't support them when they needed it, so the author isn't obligated to reciprocate now.\n"
