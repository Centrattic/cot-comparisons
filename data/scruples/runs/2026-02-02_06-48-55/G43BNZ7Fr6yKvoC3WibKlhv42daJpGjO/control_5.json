The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother after his divorce. The brother previously didn't support the author during their own messy divorce and took his wife's side when she cheated. Now, the brother is seeking help, but the author's wife is against it. The author is considering not helping.\n\nFirst, the brother's past actions: he rejected help when the author needed it and didn't support the author during a tough time. He also took his wife's side when she cheated, which caused a break in their relationship. The author had to deal with those issues without help from their brother.\n\nNow, the brother is in a similar situation, but the author is hesitant. The author's wife is against helping, which adds to the conflict. The author is considering not helping, given the history. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while family usually expects support, the brother's past behavior was harmful. The author isn't obligated to help someone who previously didn't support them. Also, the brother took a long time to realize the truth, which might indicate he wasn't trying to be supportive then. The author is within their rights to prioritize their own well-being and current wife's feelings. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not helping.\n"
