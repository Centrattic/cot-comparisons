The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they are in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The brother and the user are close, but there's a history of conflict. The user had a messy divorce and asked for help, but the brother didn't support them, instead being influenced by his wife. Later, the brother's wife cheated, and when the user confronted him, he took her side. Now the brother is sorry and wants help, but the user's wife is against it because of past issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The brother didn't support the user during their tough time, which probably caused hurt. The user's current wife is their support, which is positive. The brother's actions led to a strained relationship. Now, the brother is in a similar situation. The user is thinking of cutting him off again, especially since the brother's wife was unfaithful with the same person, and the user's wife is upset about the past.\n\nThe user might feel betrayed because their brother didn't help them before, even if it was due to his wife's influence. But is it wrong for the user not to help now? It's a personal decision. The brother is now in a similar spot, and the user might not want to repeat the cycle. However, the brother has apologized. The user's wife is against helping, which could be a valid concern given the history. \n\nI think the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries after being hurt. The brother's past behavior was poor, so the user's hesitation makes sense. It's about mutual respect and whether the user feels the apology is genuine. Since the brother previously didn't support them, the user might not feel obligated to help now. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
