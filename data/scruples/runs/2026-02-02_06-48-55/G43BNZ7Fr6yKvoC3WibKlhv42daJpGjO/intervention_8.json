The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during a divorce. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the brother and author were very close, but their relationship has been strained. The author's first marriage was a mess, and when he asked for help, the brother refused and was influenced by his wife's lies. The author managed to get through it with his current wife's support. Then, the brother's wife had an affair, and the brother took her side when the author told him. This led to no contact for two years. Now, the brother is getting a divorce after finding out about the affair and wants help, but the author's wife is against helping due to past issues.\n\nThe author is considering not helping. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nI need to weigh the author's past experiences and the brother's actions. The brother didn't support the author during his tough time, took the wife's side, and caused a rift. Now the brother is asking for help, but the author has valid reasons for resentment. The author's wife is also against helping given the history.\n\nIs the author wrong for not helping? Well, the brother's past actions were hurtful and unsupportive. The author has justified reasons for not wanting to help, especially after being wronged before. The brother's wife's lies and the brother taking her side were significant betrayals. The author's response (texting her a few times when drunk) might have been poor, but the brother's rejection was more impactful.\n\nThe key here is whether the author has a moral obligation to help despite the past. Given the brother's history of not supporting him, it's reasonable for the author to prioritize his own well-being and his wife's feelings. The brother's current request comes with a history of betrayal. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to help. Therefore, answer B.\n"
