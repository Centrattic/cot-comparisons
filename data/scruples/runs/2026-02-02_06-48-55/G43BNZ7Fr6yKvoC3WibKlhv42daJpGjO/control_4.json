The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong by not helping their brother during his divorce. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his brother were very close. The author had a failed marriage at 19, got a messy divorce, and asked the brother for help. The brother didn't support him, which caused a rift. Later, the brother's wife had an affair, but he took her side when the author warned him. The brother cut off contact. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and wants help, but the author's wife is against it because of past issues. The author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are the history of strained relationships. The brother didn't help when the author needed support, and then took the wife's side when accused of an affair. The author felt betrayed multiple times. Now, the brother is asking for help, but the author is hesitant because of past experiences. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not helping. From the story, it seems the brother has a history of not supporting the author when needed. The author's wife is also against helping again. The author might feel justified in not helping due to the brother's past actions. The brother's wife had a vendetta and the brother took her side, which indicates a pattern of not being supportive. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while family usually expects support, the author has valid reasons based on the brother's previous behavior. It's a complex situation with mutual hurt. The author isn't obligated to help if they feel it's not reciprocated or if it causes further harm. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
