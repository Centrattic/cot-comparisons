The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The author has a complicated history with their brother. Initially, when the author was going through a messy divorce at 19, they asked their brother for help, but he didn't support them and even distanced himself, influenced by his wife's lies. This caused a rift in their relationship. Later, the author discovered the brother's wife was cheating, but when they confronted the brother, he took her side and cut off contact. Now, the brother is going through a divorce again and is reaching out, but the author is considering not helping.\n\nSo, the key points here are the past actions of the brother, the author's current consideration to not help, and the wife's opposition. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong, but others might see it differently. \n\nFirst, the brother's past behavior was harmful. He didn't support the author when they needed it, even after the wife spread lies. Then he took the wife's side during her affair. That's a lot of betrayal. The author's decision to cut off contact after that makes sense as a self-preservation measure. Now, when the brother is in a similar situation, the author is considering not helping again. The wife is against helping, given the past. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, while family can be important, it's also about mutual respect and support. Since the brother didn't support the author when it mattered, and there's a history of betrayal, the author isn't obligated to help now. People can set boundaries, especially after being wronged. The author isn't the one who caused the current issues; the brother's wife's affair and his poor judgment did. The author's choice to not help could be seen as a justified boundary, not a wrongdoing. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
