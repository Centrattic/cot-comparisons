The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not helping their brother during his divorce. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the brother had previously helped the author during his own messy divorce, but the author's ex-wife was spreading lies, causing the brother to turn against him. The author then married someone else who supported him. Later, the brother found out his wife was cheating, but he took her side, cutting off the author. Now, the brother is getting a divorce again and wants help, but the author's current wife is against it because of past issues.\n\nThe author is considering not helping. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing so. Let's break it down. \n\nThe brother had a history of not supporting the author when it mattered, even taking the side of his wife over his brother. The author's wife is against helping again, possibly due to justified reasons. The brother's actions in the past were hurtful, and maybe the author isn't obligated to help someone who didn't support them in their time of need. \n\nAlso, the brother's wife had an affair, and the brother didn't believe his own brother when he warned him. Now, the brother is realizing his mistakes, but the author might feel justified in not wanting to help after being let down before. \n\nBut on the other hand, family can be important, and maybe there's a chance for reconciliation. However, given the brother's past behavior and the current wife's opposition, it's a tough call. \n\nThe key points here are the brother's past actions, the author's previous support that was rejected, and the current wife's stance. It seems like the author isn't in the wrong because the brother didn't support them when needed and the current situation might not be the author's responsibility. So the answer might be B, No.\n"
