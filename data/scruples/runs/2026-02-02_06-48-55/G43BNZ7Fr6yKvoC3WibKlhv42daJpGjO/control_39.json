The divorce was really messy and I thought about killing myself just so I don't have to deal with it. I went to my brother and asked him for help (both financial and just support) and he more or less told me to get fucked. His wife was filling his mind with lies about me and to this day I have no clue why she had a personal vendetta against me. \n\n Eventually the divorce was done, I made it through because my now-wife supported me during it. My brother and I had a relationship after that, but no where near as close as before. I married my wife at 24 and we're still together. Some time later I found out his wife was having an affair with a coworker and confronted her about it. He took her side, accused me of trying to drive a wedge between them, and said he wants nothing to do with me anymore. That's about it for the past 2 years, no contact at all. (I'll admit texting his wife calling her a cheating cunt a few times when I was drunk but that's irrelevant). \n\n Yesterday he called me and said he found out she's been having an affair (with the same guy nonetheless, how do you not investigate that relationship sooner) and he's sorry for not believing me. They're getting a divorce now but my wife is violently opposed to helping him out considering what happened before. I'm considering not responding and moving on with my life. AITA if I do so?\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about whether they should help their brother during his divorce, given past events.\n\nFirst, the brother and the author were close, but the brother didn't support the author during their own divorce. The brother's wife spread lies, which might have influenced him. The author then found out the brother's wife was cheating, but the brother took her side. They haven't spoken in two years. Now the brother is asking for help after the divorce, but the author's current wife is against it. The author is considering ignoring him.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by not helping. The key points here are: The brother didn't help before, took his wife's side over his brother, and then there was some harsh communication (texting the sister-in-law a derogatory term when drunk). The brother is now asking for help after a similar situation.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author was let down by the brother when they needed support. The brother's actions were hurtful. Now, the brother is in a similar situation. The author might feel they don't owe him help after that. The wife's past support helped the author through their own crisis. \n\nThe brother's wife's lies and affair might be a red flag. The brother didn't believe the author before, so maybe the author is justified in being cautious. The author isn't obligated to help someone who previously didn't support them, especially if there's a history of betrayal. \n\nHowever, family ties and forgiveness could be arguments for helping, but given the brother's behavior, the author might feel they can't trust him. The author's mental health was severely affected before, so cutting off contact could be a self-preservation move.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because the author has legitimate reasons to not help, given the brother's past actions and the lack of trust. The brother's betrayal and the author's need to protect themselves make it understandable.\n"
