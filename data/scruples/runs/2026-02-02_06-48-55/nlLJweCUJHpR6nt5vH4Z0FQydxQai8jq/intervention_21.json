I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like.

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they responded when their friend came out as gay. The author was at a bar with a buddy who came out to them. The author knew the friend was gay or bisexual, maybe even had a crush on someone else. The author then said something along the lines of not caring if their friend was gay, and even added that they don't care who others like as long as they have their girlfriend. The friend got angry and left, and now the author is wondering if they're an a**hole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of coming out. Coming out can be a vulnerable moment for someone. They might be seeking support and reassurance. The author's response seems dismissive or even flippant. Saying \"I don't give a fuck\" might not come across as supportive, even if the intent was to say it doesn't matter. The way it's phrased could sound insensitive. The friend probably wanted emotional support, not a casual remark that might minimize their feelings.\n\nAlso, adding the part about having a girlfriend and not caring who others like might have shifted the focus from the friend's feelings to the author's own situation. This could make the friend feel invalidated. Even if the author is trying to present themselves as accepting, actions and words matter. The friend's reaction of getting angry and leaving suggests that the message wasn't received as intended.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, when someone shares something personal, especially something as significant as their sexual orientation, the listener should respond with empathy and support. The author's response might have been seen as dismissive. Even if the author's intention was to show acceptance, the delivery was harsh. The key here is the impact on the friend's feelings versus the author's intent. The friend felt unheard or uncared for, leading to the argument and the friend storming out.\n\nThe author might have thought they were being open-minded, but the way they expressed it came off as indifferent. The phrase \"I don't give a fuck\" is strong and can be perceived as uncaring. The author should've focused on validating the friend's feelings instead of making a statement about their own indifference. The fact that the author is considering apologizing is a positive step, indicating they recognize the potential harm in their words.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intent might have been to show acceptance, the method of expression was inappropriate. The friend needed emotional support, and the author's response failed to provide that. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
