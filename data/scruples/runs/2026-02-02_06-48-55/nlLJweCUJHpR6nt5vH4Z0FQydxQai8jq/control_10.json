I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they responded when their friend came out to them as gay. The author was at a bar with a buddy who revealed he was gay. The author had some prior knowledge, like hearing about a crush on another guy. The author's response was, \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay... I got a girlfriend and since then I can't give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\" The friend got angry and left, and the author is now wondering if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend felt the need to come out, which is a significant and personal moment. The author's response, while trying to express indifference, might have come across as dismissive or even offensive. The phrase \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay\" is strong and could be seen as minimizing the importance of the friend's disclosure. Even if the author intended to be supportive, the way it was phrased might have made the friend feel like their feelings weren't respected. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the girlfriend, which might imply that their stance on others' relationships is influenced by their own relationship, which could be insensitive. The friend was looking for comfort and support, and the author's reaction led to an argument and the friend storming out. That suggests the response wasn't well-received. \n\nIn terms of social norms and empathy, when someone comes out, they expect a supportive reaction. The author's response, even if well-meaning, might have lacked the emotional support and understanding needed in that moment. Using strong language like \"I don't give a fuck\" can be perceived as harsh, regardless of intent. \n\nAdditionally, the author's admission that they always tried to present themselves as someone who doesn't care about such things implies they might have known the right approach but failed in execution. The friend's anger and leaving indicate that the author's words hurt or offended him. \n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to be hurtful, the way they expressed their indifference could be seen as dismissive and potentially harmful. The key here is the context of someone sharing a personal and vulnerable moment, and the response not providing the expected support. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
