I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend came out as gay, and the author responded in a way that the friend found dismissive. The author said they don't care if he's gay or who he likes, but added that they have a girlfriend and don't care who others like except her. The friend got angry and left.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The friend came out, which is a significant and personal moment. The author's response, while stating they don't care, included a part about not caring who others like except their girlfriend. This might have come off as minimizing the friend's experience. The friend felt he needed comfort, and the author's reply didn't provide support but instead shifted focus to the author's own relationship. \n\nEven if the author didn't mean to be dismissive, the friend's reaction shows that the message wasn't received as intended. The author's statement could be seen as invalidating the friend's moment of vulnerability. In such situations, the appropriate response is usually to acknowledge the friend's feelings, offer support, and listen without making it about oneself. \n\nThe author might have thought they were being accepting, but the way they phrased it, especially the part about not caring who others like except their girlfriend, could be perceived as flippant or dismissive. The friend was seeking support, not a general statement about the author's indifference. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably is in the wrong because their response failed to provide the support the friend needed and instead made the conversation about the author's own perspective, which can be hurtful in a vulnerable moment.\n"
