I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend came out as gay, and the author responded with something that made the friend angry and storm out. The author says they wanted to express that it doesn't matter if someone is gay, but their actual response was a bit harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The friend shared something personal, which is coming out. That's a significant moment for someone, and it usually requires support and empathy. The author's response was dismissive and maybe even a bit flippant. They said they don't care if the friend is gay, but then added a part about not caring who others like because they have a girlfriend. This might come off as insensitive, especially since the friend was looking for comfort, not a casual dismissal.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. The author's intention was to be accepting, but the way they expressed it might have been hurtful. Even if the content of the message is supportive, the tone and the specific words used can matter a lot in such a situation. Saying \"I don't give a fuck\" is pretty strong language and might not convey the support that was intended. The friend felt that their important moment was met with indifference or even mockery, leading to the argument and the friend leaving.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that they presented themselves as someone who doesn't care about others' sexual orientation. However, the response here didn't align with that image, which could be why the friend was upset. The friend might have expected a more empathetic reaction rather than a dismissive one, especially since they were sharing something vulnerable.\n\nSo, even though the author's intent was to be accepting, the execution of their response was lacking in the necessary support and empathy. The friend felt disrespected or not heard, which is why there was an argument. Therefore, the author is likely at fault here because they failed to provide the emotional support that the situation required. The answer should be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
