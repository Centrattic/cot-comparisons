I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person told their friend they don't care if he's gay, but the friend got angry and left.\n\nFirst, the friend came out to them. That's a big moment for someone, right? They probably wanted support or understanding. The author's response was, \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay... I got a girlfriend and since then I can't give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\" \n\nHmm, the tone here is dismissive. Even though the author is saying they don't care, the way they phrased it might come off as uncaring. The friend was looking for comfort, but the author's response was more about their own feelings (not caring and focusing on their girlfriend). That could make the friend feel like their important news was brushed aside. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they always tried to present themselves as accepting of different sexual orientations. So there's an expectation that they would be supportive. But their actual reaction was the opposite. The friend felt hurt, which suggests the author's words weren't supportive and maybe even hurtful. \n\nEven if the author didn't mean to be, the friend's reaction indicates that the message received was not the intended one. In situations where someone shares something personal, the response should be empathetic. The author's statement, while stating they don't care, didn't provide the emotional support the friend needed. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably should have responded with more empathy and support, not a dismissive comment. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
