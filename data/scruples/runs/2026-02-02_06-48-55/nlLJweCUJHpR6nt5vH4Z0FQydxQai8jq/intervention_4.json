I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend came out as gay, and the author responded with what he thought was a supportive statement but ended up causing an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend came out, which is a significant and personal moment. The author's response was, \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay... I got a girlfriend and ever since then I can't give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\" The friend got angry, feeling that he was looking for comfort and support, but instead, the author's response came across as dismissive or even offensive.\n\nThe key here is the intent versus the impact. The author claims they don't care about someone's sexual orientation, but the way they phrased it might have been hurtful. The friend wanted support, and the author's comment about not caring who others like, especially in the context of having a girlfriend, might have sounded insensitive. Even if the author didn't mean to, the response could be seen as minimizing the friend's feelings or the importance of his coming out.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they tried to present themselves as someone who doesn't care about such things, but their reaction here contradicts that. The friend felt the need to share something important, and the author's response didn't acknowledge the vulnerability or the need for empathy. Even if the author's intention was to be nonchalant, the way it was delivered might have been off-putting.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's response, while perhaps intended to be supportive, likely came across as dismissive. The friend was looking for comfort, and the author didn't provide that. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. The correct answer is A.\n"
