I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told a friend it doesn't matter if he's gay, and the friend got angry and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social context. Coming out is a significant and often vulnerable moment for someone. The friend shared this personal information expecting support or at least understanding. The author's response, while trying to be indifferent, might have come across as dismissive. The phrase \"I don't give a fuck\" is strong and could be perceived as insensitive, even if the intention was to show acceptance. \n\nThe friend likely wanted emotional support, not a statement that downplays the importance of their revelation. The author's mention of their own girlfriend and not caring who others like might have made the friend feel that their experience wasn't valued. \n\nEven though the author claims to be open-minded about diversity, actions speak louder than words. The key here is the friend's reaction. They felt upset and stormed out, indicating that the author's response was hurtful. Apologizing is a good step, which the author is considering, but that doesn't negate the initial wrongdoing.\n\nIn terms of social norms, being supportive in such situations is crucial. The author's response might have unintentionally invalidated the friend's feelings. So, despite the author's intent, the impact was negative. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
