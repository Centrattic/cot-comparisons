      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told a friend they don't care if he's gay, and the friend got upset and left. The author is wondering if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend came out to the author, which is a significant and personal moment. Coming out can be scary, so the friend probably expected support. The author's response was, \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay... I got a girlfriend and ever since then I can't give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\" \n\nHmm. The author's statement is dismissive. Even though they meant to say it doesn't matter, the way they phrased it might have come off as insensitive. Mentioning their girlfriend and not caring about others' preferences could make the friend feel like their personal revelation isn't valued or respected. Friends often seek emotional support when sharing something important, and the author's response might not have provided that. \n\nAlso, the friend was angry because he wanted comfort, and the author didn't provide it. The author's approach might have been too blunt or uncaring. Even if the author has always tried to present as accepting, the delivery here was problematic. \n\nIn terms of social norms, being supportive and empathetic is usually expected in such situations. The author's response, while maybe not intentionally harmful, didn't offer the support the friend needed. So the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. The key points are the friend's need for comfort versus the author's dismissive response. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n"
