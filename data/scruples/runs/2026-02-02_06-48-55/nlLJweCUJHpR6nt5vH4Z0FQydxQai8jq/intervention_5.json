I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told a friend they don't care if he's gay, and the friend got angry and left. The author is now wondering if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The friend came out to the author. The author responded with a statement that they don't care about the friend's sexuality and mentioned their own girlfriend. The friend felt the response was dismissive and wanted comfort, leading to an argument.\n\nThe author's main point is that they don't care about others' sexual orientation. However, in the context of a friend coming out, the response might have been seen as insensitive. Even if the author intended to be accepting, the way they phrased it could come off as minimizing the significance of the friend's coming out. The author's comment about their girlfriend might have also made it seem like they're not taking the moment seriously, which could be hurtful.\n\nThe friend was seeking support, and the author's reaction didn't provide the emotional support expected. Even if the author's intention was to show acceptance, the execution might have been lacking. Friends coming out often need empathy and validation, not a neutral or dismissive response. The fact that the friend was angry and left suggests that the author's words were not well-received.\n\nAlso, the author admits they might apologize, which indicates some recognition of the potential issue. The key here is whether the response was considerate of the friend's emotional needs. Even if the author isn't homophobic, the way they communicated their acceptance might have been inappropriate in the moment. So, the author is likely in the wrong because they failed to provide the support their friend needed during a vulnerable moment, even if their intentions were good.\n"
