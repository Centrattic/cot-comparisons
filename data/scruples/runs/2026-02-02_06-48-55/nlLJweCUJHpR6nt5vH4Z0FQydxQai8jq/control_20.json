I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they responded to their friend coming out as gay.\n\nFirst, the author was with their friend at a bar when the friend came out. The author knew the friend was gay or bisexual because of previous crushes. The author's response was, \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever since then I can't give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe friend got angry, felt the author wasn't offering the support they needed, and left the bar. The author is now wondering if they're an asshole.\n\nSo, why might the author be in the wrong? Well, when someone comes out, they often seek validation and support. The author's response, while stating they don't care, included a dismissive comment about their own girlfriend and not caring about who others like. This could be seen as minimizing the friend's experience. The friend felt hurt and stormed out, indicating the response wasn't supportive. Even if the author's intention was to be accepting, the delivery was off. Phrases like \"I don't give a fuck\" can come across as insensitive, especially when someone is sharing something personal. The author didn't acknowledge the friend's feelings or offer comfort, which the friend needed. So, yes, the author likely made a mistake in how they handled the situation. They should have been more empathetic and supportive instead of making a flippant remark about their own relationship.\n"
