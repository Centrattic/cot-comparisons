I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about coming out to a friend and the friend's reaction.\n\nSo the friend told the author he's gay. The author responded by saying they don't care if he's gay or who he likes, adding that since they have a girlfriend, they don't care who others like. The friend got angry and left.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the author's response and the context. The author claims they don't care about others' sexual orientation, but their response might have been dismissive. The friend was sharing something personal, expecting support, but the author's reply was more about their own relationship, which could come off as insensitive.\n\nEven if the author didn't mean to be, saying \"I don't give a fuck\" might be too blunt. It could make the friend feel like their feelings aren't important. The author's girlfriend's presence is mentioned, but that's not relevant to the friend's coming out. The friend probably wanted emotional support, and the author's response didn't address that. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they've always tried to be non-judgmental. But actions speak louder. The response might have been perceived as indifferent or even mocking. Even if the author's intention was to be accepting, the delivery was harsh. \n\nSo, in terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it seems like they were. They should have acknowledged the friend's feelings and offered support instead of making it about themselves. Apologizing would be appropriate here. So the answer is A.\n"
