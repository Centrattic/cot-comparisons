I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend came out as gay at a bar, and the author responded with \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay... I got a girlfriend and since then I can't give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\" The friend got angry and left, and the author is now wondering if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social context. Coming out is a significant and personal moment for someone. The friend probably expected support and understanding. The author's response, while stating that they don't care about the friend's sexuality, might come across as dismissive or even condescending. The phrase \"I don't give a fuck\" is pretty harsh, even if the intention was to show indifference. It could be perceived as insensitive, especially in a situation where the friend was seeking emotional support.\n\nThe author mentions they wanted to present themselves as someone who doesn't care about such things, but the way they expressed it might have been tone-deaf. The part about the girlfriend and not caring who others like might imply that the author isn't interested in the friend's personal life, which could make the friend feel unappreciated. Even if the author meant to be accepting, the response didn't acknowledge the friend's courage in coming out or offer the support the friend needed.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction\u2014getting angry and storming out\u2014suggests that the author's words hurt or offended them. The author now plans to apologize, which is a good step, but the question is whether they were in the wrong initially. In most social norms, when someone shares something personal, the expected response is empathy and support. A dismissive or nonchalant reply, even if the content is accepting, can still be hurtful. So the author's approach, while not malicious, was likely inappropriate in the context of the conversation. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A)."
