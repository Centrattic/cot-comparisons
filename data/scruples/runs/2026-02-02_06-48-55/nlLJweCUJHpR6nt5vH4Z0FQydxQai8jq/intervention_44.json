I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend came out to him as gay, and the author responded by saying they don't care if he's gay or who he likes, followed by a comment about his own girlfriend. The friend got angry and left, and the author is wondering if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend was sharing something personal, which is coming out. That's a big deal for many people because it's a vulnerable moment. The author's response was about not caring, which might seem accepting on the surface, but the way it's phrased could be dismissive. The author says, \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay... hell I don't give a fuck who you like.\" Then they add, \"I got a girlfriend and ever since then I can't give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\" \n\nThe problem here might be that the author's response trivializes the friend's important personal revelation. Even if the author doesn't have a problem with being gay, the way they respond could be seen as minimizing the significance of the friend's decision to come out. The friend was looking for support or understanding, but instead, the author's reaction was more about their own indifference, possibly even implying that relationships (like their own girlfriend) make other people's orientations irrelevant. That might come off as disrespectful or not listening to the friend's emotional needs.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they tried to present themselves as someone who doesn't care about others' skin color, religion, or sexual orientation. But in reality, their response didn't align with that image. The friend felt that the author wasn't there to provide comfort but instead dismissed the situation. The fact that the friend got angry and left suggests that the author's response was hurtful.\n\nEven if the author's intent was to be accepting, the impact of their words was negative. In situations where someone is sharing something personal, the reaction can affect the relationship. The key here is that the friend needed emotional support, and the author's response didn't provide that. The author's comment about their girlfriend might have also been perceived as a backhanded or insincere way of saying they don't care, which could add to the friend's frustration.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong because their response dismissed the friend's vulnerability and didn't offer the support the friend was seeking. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt, the way they expressed their indifference was inappropriate in the context of the friend's emotional disclosure.\n"
