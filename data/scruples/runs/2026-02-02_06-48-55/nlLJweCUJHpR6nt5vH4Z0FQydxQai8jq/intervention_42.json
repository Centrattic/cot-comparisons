      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend coming out as gay, and the author responds with a dismissive comment, leading to an argument and the friend storming out.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was at a bar with a buddy who came out. The author already had some suspicion (heard about a crush), but when the friend finally shared, the author's response was \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay... I got a girlfriend and since then I can't give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\" The friend got angry, felt hurt, and left.\n\nThe author is questioning if they're an asshole. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know my take. \n\nNow, considering social norms and empathy. Coming out is a significant and often vulnerable moment. The friend likely wanted support and understanding. The author's response, while intending to be nonchalant, comes off as dismissive and potentially invalidating. Phrases like \"I don't give a fuck\" can be perceived as minimizing the importance of the friend's confession. The friend might have felt that the author wasn't taking their feelings seriously, hence the anger.\n\nEven if the author claims to not care about others' orientations, the delivery and context matter. The friend was seeking emotional support, and the author's reply might have been seen as insensitive. The use of \"I can't give a fuck who anyone but she likes\" could imply that the author is prioritizing their own relationship over their friend's feelings, which is not supportive.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's response likely hurt the friend's feelings. While the author might not have meant to be offensive, the impact is what matters. Friends often expect empathy in such situations. The author's reaction didn't provide that, leading to conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being supportive and for the dismissive language.\n"
