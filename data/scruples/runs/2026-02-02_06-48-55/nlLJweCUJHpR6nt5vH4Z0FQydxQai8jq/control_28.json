I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend coming out as gay, and the author responds with a dismissive comment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend shared an important personal detail, expecting support or empathy. The author's response was \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay... I got a girlfriend and ever since then I can't give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\" That seems pretty dismissive. Even if the author intended to be supportive, the way it's phrased is likely hurtful. \n\nThe key issue here is the friend's emotional need. When someone comes out, they often seek validation and care. The author's response focuses on their own feelings about their girlfriend, which might make the friend feel unimportant. The friend got angry and left, which indicates that the author's words were not well-received.\n\nEven if the author didn't mean to harm, the impact is what matters. The response could be seen as minimizing the significance of the friend's disclosure. The author should have acknowledged the friend's feelings and offered support. Apologizing is a good step, but the question is whether they were in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of social norms, being respectful and empathetic is expected. The author's statement, while maybe not bigoted, is careless and inconsiderate in the moment. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the response was dismissive and hurtful, even if unintended.\n"
