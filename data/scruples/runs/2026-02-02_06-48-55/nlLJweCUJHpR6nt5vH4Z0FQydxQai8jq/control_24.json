      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend coming out as gay, and the author responds with a statement that they don't care, even going as far as saying they don't care who the friend likes. The friend gets angry and leaves, and the author is wondering if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The author knew their friend was gay or bisexual before the friend came out. The friend was sharing something personal, expecting support. The author's response was dismissive, using strong language like \"I don't give a fuck,\" and then made a comment about their own girlfriend. The friend felt hurt and left, and the author is considering apologizing but wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the appropriateness of the author's response. Even if the author doesn't hold prejudiced views, the way they expressed their indifference might have been hurtful. The friend was seeking comfort, not a dismissive reaction. The phrase \"I don't give a fuck\" might come across as uncaring, even if the author meant to say they don't mind. The mention of their own girlfriend might also imply that the author is more focused on their own relationship than on the friend's moment of vulnerability.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone comes out, they often expect empathy and support. A response that's too casual or dismissive, even if intended to be positive, can be seen as invalidating the person's feelings. The author's friend was sharing something important, and the author's reaction didn't acknowledge that significance. The author's apology is a step towards making things right, which suggests they recognize the potential harm in their words.\n\nHowever, the author did express that they don't care about others' sexual orientation. But the delivery was problematic. Intentions matter, but so does impact. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt, the impact on the friend was negative. So, in this case, the author is in the wrong because their response was inappropriate for the situation and hurt their friend. Therefore, answer A.\n"
