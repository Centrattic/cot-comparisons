I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they responded when their friend came out to them. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe friend told them he's gay. The author knew he was gay or bisexual beforehand, maybe even heard about a crush. The author responds with a statement that seems dismissive, saying they don't care and that they have a girlfriend so they don't care who others like. The friend gets angry, feels unheard, and leaves.\n\nFirst, even if the author is okay with their friend being gay, the way they responded might have been hurtful. The friend was sharing something personal, so the author's reaction of indifference or mockery could have been unkind. The friend was looking for support, not a dismissive comment about the author's own relationship.\n\nAlso, the author says they tried to present themselves as someone who doesn't care about others' preferences. But their response was more about their own feelings (\"I have a girlfriend\") rather than showing empathy. That might have made the friend feel like their declaration wasn't important or taken seriously.\n\nEven if the author isn't homophobic, how they expressed their acceptance was inappropriate. The friend needed emotional support, not a statement that downplayed the significance of their coming out. The author should have acknowledged the friend's feelings and offered support instead of deflecting with their own perspective.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the response was dismissive and hurtful, even if their intent wasn't to be negative.\n"
