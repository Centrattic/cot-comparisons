I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a friend came out as gay, and the author responded by saying they don't care and added a comment about their own relationship. The friend got angry and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend came out to the author, which is a significant and personal moment. Coming out can be vulnerable, so the friend probably expected support. The author's response was dismissive. While the author claims to not care about others' sexual orientation, the way they phrased it might have been insensitive. The comment about their girlfriend could have made the friend feel invalidated, as if the author is more focused on their own relationship rather than the friend's feelings.\n\nAlso, the friend reacted by getting angry and leaving, which indicates that the author's response was hurtful. Even if the author didn't mean to be, the way they expressed their indifference might not have been supportive. The key here is empathy. When someone shares something important, the listener should validate their feelings rather than downplay them, even if their intention is to show acceptance.\n\nThe author mentioned they tried to present themselves as nonjudgmental, but actions speak louder. The response didn't show active listening or emotional support. Instead, it might have come off as dismissive. So, even if the author isn't a bigot, their response wasn't appropriate in the moment. They should have acknowledged the friend's courage and offered support instead of making a statement about their own girlfriend. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
