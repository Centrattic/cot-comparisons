I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told a friend they don't care if he's gay, and the friend got upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend came out to the author, which is a significant and personal moment. The friend was seeking support or at least understanding. The author's response was dismissive, even if they didn't intend to hurt. The phrase \"I don't give a fuck\" might come off as insensitive, especially in a vulnerable situation. \n\nEven though the author claims they don't care about others' sexual orientations, their reaction here caused an argument. The key point here is how the message was delivered. The author's response focused on their own girlfriend and not caring about others' preferences, which might not address the friend's need for support. \n\nThe friend felt that the author wasn't offering the comfort they needed. The author's approach might have been more about their own stance rather than listening. In situations where someone is sharing something personal, the response should be empathetic and validating. The author's comment, while stating acceptance, didn't provide the emotional support the friend was seeking.\n\nAdditionally, using strong language like \"I don't give a fuck\" could be seen as uncaring, regardless of the author's intention. The author might have a good attitude towards acceptance, but the delivery was off. People often need to feel heard when they come out, and the reaction can impact their self-esteem. \n\nEven if the author didn't mean to offend, the result was an argument and the friend storming out. The author's responsibility is to acknowledge the friend's feelings and offer support. The fact that the author is considering apologizing shows some self-awareness, but the initial reaction still caused harm. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because their response was dismissive and didn't provide the necessary emotional support the friend needed during a vulnerable moment.\n"
