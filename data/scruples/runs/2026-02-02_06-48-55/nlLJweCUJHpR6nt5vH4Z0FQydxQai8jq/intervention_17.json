I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told a friend they don't care if he's gay, but the friend got angry and left. The author wants to know if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the context. The friend came out to the author, which is a significant and personal moment. The author responded with something that sounds dismissive. The exact quote is: \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever since then I can't give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\" \n\nSo, the friend was probably expecting support or empathy. Instead, the author's response might have come off as indifferent or even dismissive. Even though the author intended to say it doesn't matter, the way it's phrased could be hurtful. Using phrases like \"I don't give a fuck\" can sound uncaring, especially in a vulnerable moment. Also, mentioning their girlfriend might imply that the author's own relationships are more important than the friend's feelings, which could be perceived as dismissive.\n\nThe friend got angry because they wanted comfort, not a neutral or indifferent response. The author's lack of emotional support here could have made the friend feel invalidated. Even if the author is trying to be accepting, the delivery is key. The right approach would be to acknowledge the friend's feelings and offer support, not just a blunt statement.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions they tried to present themselves as someone who doesn't care about such things. But the response contradicts that because it's not supportive. The friend might have felt that the author's reaction was not as accepting as they claimed.\n\nIn terms of whether it's right or wrong, the author's response likely hurt the friend's feelings. Even if the intent was to show acceptance, the execution was poor. The friend was looking for emotional support, and the author failed to provide that. So, the author is in the wrong here. They should apologize and work on being more empathetic in such situations.\n"
