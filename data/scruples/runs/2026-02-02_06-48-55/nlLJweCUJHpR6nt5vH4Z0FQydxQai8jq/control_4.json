I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told a friend they don't care if he's gay. The friend got angry and left.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the author's statement. The author said, \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay... I got a girlfriend and since then I can't give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\" The key here is the tone and the content. Using \"fuck\" is pretty strong language. Also, the author is dismissing the friend's coming out by saying they don't care. The friend was seeking support, and the author's response was dismissive and maybe even a bit flippant.\n\nEven if the author meant to be supportive, the way they phrased it could come off as insensitive. The friend was sharing something personal and important, and the author's reaction was to minimize it by saying they don't care. That could make the friend feel invalidated. The author's mention of their girlfriend seems irrelevant here and might have been a way to deflect or show that they don't care about the friend's sexuality, which could be hurtful.\n\nThe friend's anger makes sense because when someone comes out, they're often looking for acceptance and support. The author's response didn't provide that and instead made it seem like their sexuality wasn't important. Even if the author doesn't hold prejudices, the reaction was inappropriate in the moment. The author is planning to apologize, which is a good step, but the question is about being in the wrong.\n\nSo, based on the context, the author's response was dismissive and hurtful. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respond with the support and empathy the friend needed.\n"
