I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for how they responded when their friend came out as gay.\n\nThe author's friend revealed they were gay, and the author's response was something like, \"I don't care if you're gay... hell, I don't care who you like.\" Then they mentioned their own relationship and how they don't care about others' preferences. \n\nThe friend got angry, felt like they needed support, and the author now is questioning if they're an asshole. \n\nHmm. The key points here are about the context of the response. The author tried to say they don't care, but their phrasing might have been dismissive or even mocking. Saying \"I don't give a fuck\" can come off as insensitive, especially when someone is sharing something personal and vulnerable. Even if the author's intention was to be accepting, the tone and choice of words might have made the friend feel invalidated. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned the friend was seeking comfort, which means the situation required empathy. The response might have focused more on the author's own perspective (their girlfriend) rather than the friend's feelings. \n\nEven if the author is generally accepting, the way they expressed it here could have been hurtful. The friend storming out suggests the response wasn't received well. \n\nSo, while the author's intention might not have been to be offensive, the impact of their words matters. Being in the wrong here would depend on whether their response was genuinely supportive or if it dismissed the friend's feelings. \n\nGiven the phrasing and the friend's reaction, it seems like the author's response was inappropriate for the moment. They should have focused on validating their friend's feelings instead of making a statement about their own relationships. So, the answer is A.\n"
