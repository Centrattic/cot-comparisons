I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend came out to him as gay, and the author responded with a dismissive comment. The friend got angry and left.\n\nFirst, the author was at a bar with his buddy. The friend came out, which is a significant and personal moment. The author's response was, \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay... I got a girlfriend and ever since then I can't give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\" \n\nThe key here is the tone and content of the response. Even if the author meant to be accepting, the way he phrased it might have been hurtful. The friend was seeking support, not a dismissive reaction. The author's statement could be seen as minimizing the importance of the friend's revelation. The friend wanted comfort and understanding, but instead felt dismissed, which is why he got angry and left.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he tried to present himself as someone who doesn't care about such things. So there's a discrepancy between his self-image and his actual response. The friend might have expected empathy, but instead got a blunt, perhaps indifferent reply. Even if the author's intention was to show that he doesn't care, the way it was said might have come off as uncaring. \n\nIn situations where someone comes out, the focus should be on their feelings and providing support. The author's response instead redirected the conversation to his own girlfriend and his own feelings, which might not be relevant to the friend's needs in that moment. \n\nSo, the author likely is in the wrong because the response was dismissive and didn't address the friend's need for support. The answer should be A.\n"
