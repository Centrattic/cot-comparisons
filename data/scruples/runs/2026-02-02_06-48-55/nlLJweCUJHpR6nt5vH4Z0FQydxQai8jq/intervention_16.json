I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend coming out as gay, and the author responds by saying they don't care as long as their friend has a girlfriend. The friend gets angry and leaves.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about respect and empathy. When someone comes out, especially to a friend, they're sharing a personal part of themselves. The author's response seems dismissive, even though they intended to be non-judgmental. The problem is that the friend was looking for support and validation, not a statement that downplays the significance of his coming out. \n\nThe author says they don't care who he likes because they have a girlfriend, which might imply that the friend's sexuality isn't important in the context of their own relationship. That could come off as minimizing the friend's experience. Even if the author's intention was to show acceptance, the way it was phrased might have been insensitive. \n\nAlso, the friend felt hurt and left the conversation, which suggests that the author's response wasn't supportive. The author acknowledges that they should be a person who doesn't care about others' preferences, but their reaction contradicted that. So, there's a mismatch between the author's values and their actual response. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone shares a personal revelation, the appropriate response is usually one of support and acknowledgment. The author's response might have been too blunt and missed the emotional weight of the moment. Even if the author didn't mean any harm, the impact on the friend was negative. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because their response failed to provide the empathy and support the friend needed, leading to an argument and the friend leaving upset.\n"
