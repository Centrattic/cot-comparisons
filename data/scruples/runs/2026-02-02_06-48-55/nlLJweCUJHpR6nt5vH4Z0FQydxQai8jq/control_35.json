I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told a friend they don't care if he's gay, but the friend got upset and left. The key points here are about how the author's response might have been inappropriate.\n\nFirst, the friend came out to the author, which is a significant and personal moment. The author's response was dismissive, saying they don't care and even comparing it to not caring who others like since they have a girlfriend. That part about the girlfriend might have come off as minimizing the friend's feelings or the importance of his revelation.\n\nEven though the author claims to support diversity in sexual orientation, the way they expressed it here might have been insensitivity. The friend was seeking comfort and support, not a nonchalant reaction. The phrase \"I don't give a fuck\" could be seen as rude or dismissive, regardless of intent. The friend's anger and storming out suggests that the author's words hurt him, which indicates a failure to provide the emotional support the friend needed in that moment.\n\nThe author might have meant well, but the delivery was problematic. The response didn't acknowledge the friend's vulnerability or the significance of coming out. Instead, it focused on the author's own perspective, which could have made the friend feel invalidated. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here because the reaction was hurtful and dismissive, even if they didn't intend to be. Apologizing, as they mentioned, is probably the right step.\n"
