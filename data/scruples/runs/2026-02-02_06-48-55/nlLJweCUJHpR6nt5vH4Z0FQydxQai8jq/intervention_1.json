I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for how they reacted when their friend came out as gay. The author said, \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay... I got a girlfriend and ever since then I can't give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\" The friend got angry and left.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the author's response. The key part here is the phrase \"I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend...\" The author is minimizing the significance of the friend's coming out by equating it to not caring about others' preferences. This could come off as dismissive or even mocking. Coming out is a deeply personal and vulnerable act, and the friend likely hoped for support or understanding, not a response that trivializes their identity.\n\nThe author claims they meant to show acceptance, but the way they phrased it might have been hurtful. The mention of their own girlfriend might imply that the friend's orientation is irrelevant because the author isn't affected. However, this could also be interpreted as the author not taking the friend's experience seriously. The friend felt unsupported and left, which suggests that the response was inappropriate in the context of the moment.\n\nEven if the author intended to be accepting, the delivery and the specific words used were problematic. The use of \"don't give a fuck\" is dismissive and lacks the empathy the situation required. The friend was sharing something important, and the author's response didn't acknowledge the emotional weight of the moment. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone comes out, it's generally expected to offer support, listen, and validate their feelings. The author's response, while perhaps well-meaning, failed to do so. They might not be a bad person, but in this specific instance, their words were hurtful. The friend's reaction indicates that the author's approach was wrong, and apologizing, as they plan to do, is a good step toward making amends.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong because their response was dismissive and hurtful, even if they didn't intend to be.\n"
