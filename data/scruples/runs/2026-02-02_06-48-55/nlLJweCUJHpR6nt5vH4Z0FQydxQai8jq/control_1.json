      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told a friend, \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay... I got a girlfriend and ever since then I can't give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\" The friend got angry and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend came out to the author, which is a significant and vulnerable moment. The author's response was dismissive, using strong language like \"I don't give a fuck,\" which might come off as insensitive. Even if the author intended to say they don't care, the tone and choice of words could have been hurtful. \n\nThe friend was seeking support and comfort, which is a common expectation when someone comes out. The author's statement about having a girlfriend and not caring about others' preferences might undermine the importance of the friend's personal revelation. It's possible that the author's response didn't acknowledge the friend's feelings, making the friend feel unsupported.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they presented themselves as someone who doesn't care about others' background, but their reaction contradicted that. The friend felt the author was being dismissive, leading to an argument. The key here is whether the author's words were appropriate given the context of the friend's disclosure.\n\nIn terms of social norms and empathy, when someone shares something personal, the listener should respond with care and support. Using strong language and shifting the focus to the author's own relationship might not be the best approach. Even if the author's intention was to be non-judgmental, the execution was poor. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's response was likely inconsiderate and contributed to the friend's anger. The author should have been more attentive to the friend's emotional needs in that moment. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
