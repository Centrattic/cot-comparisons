I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a friend came out as gay, and the author responded with a dismissive comment about not caring and mentioned their own girlfriend. The friend got angry and left.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The friend shared something personal, which is a big deal. The author's response was supposed to be accepting, but maybe it came off as insensitive. Saying \"I don't give a fuck\" might be too harsh, even if the intent was to be supportive. The friend was looking for comfort, not a dismissive reaction. Also, bringing up the author's own girlfriend might have made the friend feel like their situation wasn't taken seriously. Even if the author doesn't care about others' sexual orientation, the friend needed emotional support, and the response didn't provide that. The friend's anger makes sense because sharing something personal can be vulnerable, and the response didn't acknowledge that. So, the author probably should have been more empathetic. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
