I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after a situation where they told a friend they don't care if he's gay. The author came out to a friend, and the friend reacted angrily. The author is trying to figure out if they did something wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The friend came out as gay, which is a significant and personal moment. The author's response was something like \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay...\" and then made a comment about his girlfriend. The friend was upset and felt the author wasn't providing the comfort they needed.\n\nThe key points here are about empathy and the context of the conversation. When someone comes out, they often seek support and understanding. The author's response, while stating they don't care about the friend's orientation, might have been dismissive. The part about the girlfriend could have come across as minimizing the friend's feelings or implying that the author's own relationship trivializes the friend's confession.\n\nEven though the author intended to say they don't care, the way it was delivered, especially with the \"fuck\" and the girlfriend comment, might have been perceived as insensitive. The friend was looking for emotional support, not a statement about the author's own relationship. The author's response didn't acknowledge the friend's vulnerability or the importance of the moment, which could have led to the argument.\n\nSo, even if the author's intention was to show acceptance, the method and phrasing might have been inappropriate. The friend's anger is a sign that the message wasn't received as intended. In such sensitive situations, the delivery and the context matter a lot. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not providing the emotional support the friend needed instead of a blunt statement that could be seen as dismissive.\n"
