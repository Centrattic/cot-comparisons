I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend came out as gay, and the author responded by saying they don't care and mentioned not caring who their friend likes, because they have a girlfriend. The friend got angry and left. The author is wondering if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The friend was opening up about something personal and important to him. The author's response, while stating that they don't care about the friend's sexuality, included a comment about their own relationship. The friend felt that instead of support, the author was dismissive and maybe even dismissive in a way that hurt.\n\nThe author says they meant to express that it doesn't matter, but the way they phrased it might have been insensitive. The friend was seeking support, and the author's response might have been seen as minimizing the significance of the moment. Even if the author doesn't have a problem with being gay, the way they responded could have been perceived as not taking the friend's feelings into account. The friend left because he felt his moment was not respected or properly acknowledged.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they always tried to present themselves as someone who doesn't care about such things. So there's an expectation of support, and the response might have contradicted that in the friend's eyes. The key here is the context of the conversation. When someone comes out, they often need validation and support, not a defensive or indifferent response, even if the words are \"I don't care.\" The author's response about their own girlfriend might have made it seem like they were deflecting or not truly empathizing.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably is in the wrong because they failed to provide the emotional support the friend was seeking, and their response could be seen as dismissive or inappropriate for the situation. The answer should be A.\n"
