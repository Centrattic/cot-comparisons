I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend they don't care if he's gay. The situation is that the friend came out to them at a bar. The author responded with something like \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay...\" and then the friend got angry and left.\n\nHmm, so first, the friend was sharing something personal and important. Coming out can be a big deal, so the friend likely expected support or empathy. The author's response seems dismissive. They said they don't care, and then added a comment about their own girlfriend. Maybe that made the friend feel like the author wasn't taking their confession seriously. The key here is the context of the conversation. The friend was seeking comfort or understanding, but the author's reply might have come off as flippant or not acknowledging the significance of the moment.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they tried to present themselves as someone who doesn't care about others' sexual orientation. So there's a contrast here between their self-image and their actual response. Even if the author's intention was to express acceptance, the way they phrased it might have been insensitive. Phrases like \"I don't give a fuck\" can sound rude or indifferent, regardless of the intent. The friend might have felt invalidated instead of supported. The author's comment about their girlfriend also might have been perceived as minimizing the friend's feelings, as if the author's own relationship was the only important thing.\n\nIn these kinds of situations, the right approach is usually to acknowledge the person's feelings and offer support. The author's response didn't do that. Instead, it focused on their own perspective, which might not have been what the friend needed. So even if the author wasn't intentionally being mean, the impact of their words was negative. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong here and should apologize, as they mentioned. The answer would be A.\n"
