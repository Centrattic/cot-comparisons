I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote theAITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend came out as gay, and the author responded by saying they don't care, even going as far as saying they don't care who their friend likes because they're focused on their girlfriend. The friend got angry and left, and the author is wondering if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend shared something personal and vulnerable. Coming out can be a big deal, and people usually expect support and empathy. The author's response was dismissive. Even if the author's intention was to be accepting, the way they phrased it came off as indifferent or even mocking. Saying \"I don't give a fuck\" is pretty harsh, especially in that context. It doesn't acknowledge the friend's emotional state or the significance of the moment. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned that they tried to present themselves as someone who doesn't care about others' sexual orientations, but their reaction didn't match that image. The friend felt unappreciated and possibly invalidated because they were looking for comfort. The author's focus on their own girlfriend might have made the friend feel like their feelings weren't important. \n\nEven if the author didn't mean to hurt the friend, the response was inappropriate. The key here is about empathy and active listening. When someone shares something personal, the appropriate response is to listen, offer support, and validate their feelings. The author's response was more about their own perspective and less about the friend's needs. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably is in the wrong. They failed to provide the emotional support the friend needed, responded in a way that could be seen as dismissive, and contributed to the friend feeling upset. The fact that they're considering apologizing is a good sign, but the initial reaction was definitely lacking in empathy. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
