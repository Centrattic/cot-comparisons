I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after a situation where a friend came out as gay, and the author responded with a comment that the friend took as dismissive.\n\nFirst, the friend shared something personal and important\u2014coming out. That's a big deal. The author's response was, \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay... I got a girlfriend and since then I can't give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\" While the author intended to say they don't care, the phrasing might have come off as insensitive or minimizing the friend's feelings. \n\nEven if the author thought they were being supportive, the friend felt the opposite. The friend wanted comfort and support, not a dismissive statement. The author's comment could be interpreted as not taking the moment seriously, especially the part about not caring since they have a girlfriend. That part might imply that the friend's revelation is irrelevant to the author's own relationship, which could be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned they try to present themselves as someone who doesn't care about others' sexual orientation. But their reaction contradicted that image, leading to an argument and the friend storming out. The key here is the friend's emotional response and the impact of the author's words, even if unintended.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to hurt, the way they expressed their indifference might have been the issue. In such situations, the focus should be on validating the friend's feelings and offering support. The author's response, while perhaps well-intentioned, failed to do that and instead caused hurt. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
