I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author told a friend they don't care if he's gay, and it ended up causing an argument. The friend felt hurt and left.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the context and the response. The friend came out to the author, which is a significant and personal moment. The author responded with, \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay... I got a girlfriend and since then I can't give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\" \n\nFirst, the language used by the author is pretty harsh. Using \"don't give a fuck\" twice in the same sentence might come off as dismissive. Even if the author's intention was to say they don't care, the way it's phrased could make the friend feel like their personal revelation is being trivialized. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned that the friend was seeking comfort. Coming out can be a vulnerable act, and the friend might have expected empathy or a more supportive response. The author's focus on their own girlfriend and not caring about others' preferences might have made it seem like they're not taking the friend's feelings seriously. \n\nEven if the author doesn't hold prejudices, the way they communicated their indifference might have been insensitive. The friend's reaction of getting angry and leaving suggests that the response was not well-received. \n\nThe author is considering apologizing, which is a good sign. It shows they recognize that their words might have hurt someone, even if they didn't intend to. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, while the author's intention might have been to show acceptance, the delivery was problematic. The use of harsh language and not acknowledging the friend's emotional state could be seen as the author being in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because their response was dismissive and hurtful, even if their intention was to express acceptance.\n"
