I knew he was gay or bisexual, I've heard he had a massive crush on this other guy I knew. I wanted to express that it doesn't matter if your gay or not.\n\nI said \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe got incredibly angry at me saying hes telling me something important to his heart and he wanted comfort in his friends. I always tried to present myself as a guy who doesn't care about other peoples skin colors, religions or sexual interests. I just didn't expect to be in the middle of a argument with a buddy of mine who then storms out. \n\nI will probably end up apologizing I just want to know if I am a asshole in this case. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a friend came out as gay, and the author responded with a dismissive comment, which made the friend angry and leave.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the response. The author says they wanted to express that it doesn't matter if someone is gay. But their actual words were, \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever sense then I cant give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\" The friend felt hurt and stormed out.\n\nThe key points here are the tone and content of the response. Even if the author meant to be supportive, the language used is very casual and dismissive. Using phrases like \"I don't give a fuck\" might come across as uncaring or minimizing the significance of the friend's confession. Coming out is a big moment, and the friend was seeking support or understanding. The author's response might not have provided the emotional support the friend needed. Instead, the author's comment focused on their own relationship, which could be seen as deflecting or not taking the friend's feelings seriously.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they tried to present themselves as someone who doesn't care about sexual orientation, but the actual reaction contradicts that. The friend felt that the response was inappropriate and hurtful. The author's apology is coming, but the question is whether they were wrong initially.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone comes out, it's important to listen and offer support without turning it into a statement about oneself. The author's response might have made the friend feel that their personal revelation wasn't respected. Even if the author's intention was neutral or positive, the impact of the words led to a negative reaction. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not responding appropriately to their friend's emotional moment.\n"
