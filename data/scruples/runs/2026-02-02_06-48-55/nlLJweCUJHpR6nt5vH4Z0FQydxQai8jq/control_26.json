      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is at fault for how they responded when their friend came out as gay.\n\nFirst, the author was in a bar with a buddy who came out to them. The author had already suspected the friend was gay or bisexual because of a crush. The author wanted to express that they don't care about the friend's sexuality. They said, \"I don't give a fuck if you're gay, hell I don't give a fuck who you like. I got a girlfriend and ever since then I can't give a fuck who anyone but she likes.\"\n\nThe friend got angry, felt the author was dismissive, and that they were looking for comfort from a friend. The author had always tried to present themselves as someone who doesn't care about skin color, religion, or sexual orientation. But this led to an argument and the friend storming out.\n\nSo, why might the author be in the wrong? Well, when someone comes out, they're usually seeking support and validation. The author's response, while stating they don't care, might have been perceived as dismissive or not taking the moment seriously. The friend was sharing something personal, and the author's reply focused on their own girlfriend and not caring who others like. That could make the friend feel like their feelings weren't respected.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't say anything negative about being gay. They explicitly said they don't care. But the way it's phrased, especially the part about their own girlfriend and not caring about others' preferences, might have been insensitive. It's possible the author didn't realize the friend needed emotional support rather than a statement of indifference.\n\nThe key here is the context of someone coming out. Even if the author's intention was to show acceptance, the delivery might have been inappropriate. The friend felt hurt and angry, which suggests that the message wasn't received as intended. The author's response might have been too blunt or minimizing the emotional weight of the situation.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend was looking for comfort. The response didn't offer that. Instead, it shifted the focus to the author's own relationship. That could be why the friend felt dismissed.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone shares something personal, the expected response is empathy and support. The author's reaction, while not hostile, didn't provide that. So even if they meant to be accepting, the way they expressed it was hurtful.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely at fault for not providing the emotional support their friend needed in that moment, even though they weren't expressing prejudice.\n"
