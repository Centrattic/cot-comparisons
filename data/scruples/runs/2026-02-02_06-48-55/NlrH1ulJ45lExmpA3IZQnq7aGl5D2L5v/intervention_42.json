I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who is a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug issues. The brother is on VA disability and gets paid more than the author, who works full-time but makes less. The author pays $400 a month rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without taxes. The brother's vices cost around $870 a month, which is 1/4 of his monthly pay. The author is saving and paying off loans. \n\nThe brother asked the author to move in, promising a garage spot and a basement apartment. Now, the brother is in trouble because of his vices and went to their mother for help. The mother suggested raising the author's rent instead of cutting expenses. The author felt betrayed and told his mother to stay out of his finances, threatening to move out if the rent is raised.\n\nThe author's argument is that he's helping the family by living there, and his mother's suggestion is unfair. He's trying to protect his finances. The mother's advice is to make the author pay more so the brother can afford his vices. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is in a difficult situation. He's contributing to the household but is being exploited in a way. The brother's vices are a problem. The mother's advice is to pass the problem onto the author. The author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. He's not obligated to support his brother's habits. \n\nThe mother's suggestion is to raise rent for the brother's vices, which the author is resisting. The author is acting in his own financial interest. It's about personal responsibility. The brother needs to address his own issues, not pass them on to others. The author's response is a reasonable boundary. So, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
