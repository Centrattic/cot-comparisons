I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances. The situation involves his brother being his landlord, with a problematic lifestyle. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, alcohol and drug issues, and isn't working. The author lives there, pays $400 a month, which is half the mortgage, and gets some utilities covered.\n\nThe mother suggested raising the rent to help the brother afford his vices. The author refused, saying he'd move out if they tried to increase the rent. He's arguing that he's helping the family and that his mother's advice is unfair.\n\nFirst, the author is in a vulnerable position, working minimum wage and trying to save. His brother's situation is self-sabotaging. The mother's suggestion to raise rent doesn't solve the underlying issues and seems to shift the burden onto the author. The author is setting boundaries, which is important for his financial stability. \n\nThe brother's reliance on disability and the mother's enabler role might add stress. The author's decision to refuse the rent increase isn't about greed but about not funding someone else's vices. The alternative he presents\u2014moving out and letting the mother handle the costs\u2014puts responsibility back on them.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's maintaining his financial autonomy and not enabling destructive behavior. So answer B.\n"
