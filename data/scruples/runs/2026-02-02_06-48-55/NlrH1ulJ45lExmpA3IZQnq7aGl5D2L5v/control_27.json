I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. The situation involves the author living with their brother, who has significant substance abuse issues and is receiving VA disability. The mother suggests raising the author's rent to help the brother afford his vices.\n\nFirst, the author is paying a rent that's essentially half the mortgage, which is a substantial contribution. They're making an effort to save and pay off loans, which shows financial responsibility. The brother, on the other hand, is spending a large portion of his disability on drugs and alcohol, which is self-destructive and not a sustainable use of funds meant to support someone with disabilities.\n\nThe mother's advice to raise the author's rent seems counterproductive. It's using the author's financial contribution to fund the brother's harmful habits rather than addressing the root issues. The author's response to set a boundary is understandable. They're not obligated to subsidize their brother's vices, especially when they were already helping out by moving in. The author's threat to leave if the rent is raised is a reasonable ultimatum, given the circumstances.\n\nConsidering the brother's inability to manage his finances and the mother's role in enabling this by suggesting the rent increase, the author's stance isn't unreasonable. They're protecting their own financial well-being and not taking responsibility for their brother's choices. There's no indication the author is being selfish without cause; instead, they're setting healthy boundaries. The mother's approach seems to prioritize the brother's immediate comfort over the author's financial health and the brother's long-term issues.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for themselves in a situation where their family isn't supporting them appropriately. The answer should be B.\n"
