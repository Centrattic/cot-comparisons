I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who's a veteran with PTSD, addiction issues, and gets VA disability. The author pays rent and has been saving money, but now his mother is telling his brother to raise his rent to cover his expenses. The author told his mom to stay out of his finances and said he'd move out if they tried to increase his rent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The brother is a landlord, and the author is a tenant. The mother's suggestion to raise rent could be seen as interfering in their landlord-tenant relationship. The author is paying a significant amount already, which is half the mortgage without property taxes. The brother's habits are costing him money, and the mother is suggesting a way to cover that by increasing the rent.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's helping out by living with his brother and paying rent, which is a financial contribution. However, he's not obligated to continue this if the terms change. The brother made promises (like building an apartment) that didn't come to fruition, which the author feels was a betrayal. Now, the mother's request to raise rent could disrupt the author's financial stability, especially since he's saving and paying off loans.\n\nLegally, the brother can adjust the rent if it's a month-to-month agreement, but the author is setting a boundary here. The author's actions seem reasonable because he's protecting his own financial interests. He's not asking for a favor; he's setting a condition for his stay. The mother's interference might be well-meaning but is causing conflict because it's not the author's responsibility to fund his brother's habits.\n\nThe key points are: the author is not at fault for defending his financial decisions, the brother's issues are his own responsibility, and the mother's suggestion is an overreach. The author's response is a clear boundary, which is necessary for his own well-being. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
