I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances in a specific situation.\n\nThe author is a 35-year-old man living in his brother's home. His brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and a drug addict. The brother is on VA disability, which pays twice as much as the author's job. The author pays $400 a month in rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without property taxes. The brother promised a garage parking space and a basement apartment, but the author is now being asked to pay more rent because the brother can't manage his expenses. The mother is the one suggesting raising the rent to cover the brother's vices like weed, rum, and cigarettes, which cost around $870 a month. The author says this is 1/4 of his brother's monthly pay and that he can't work because he's high or drunk. The author responded by telling his mother not to interfere and that he'll find an apartment if needed, costing $600.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions are justified. The brother is an adult with his own financial responsibilities. The author is paying rent, which is a fair arrangement. The mother's suggestion to raise rent to cover the brother's vices seems like enabling his bad habits. The author is standing up for his own financial boundaries, which is important. He's not responsible for his brother's addiction issues. The brother's problems are his own, and the mother's advice is counterproductive. The author's threat to move out if the rent is increased is a reasonable way to protect his finances. \n\nThe key points here are the brother's inability to manage his own money due to addiction, the author's reasonable rent contribution, and the mother's role in advising against the author's financial autonomy. The author isn't being inconsiderate; he's setting clear boundaries. The brother's situation is self-inflicted, so the author isn't obligated to subsidize his vices. The mother's interference is the issue, not the author's response. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's asserting his right to control his own finances and isn't responsible for his brother's choices. The mother's advice is problematic, and the author is reacting appropriately to protect himself.\n"
