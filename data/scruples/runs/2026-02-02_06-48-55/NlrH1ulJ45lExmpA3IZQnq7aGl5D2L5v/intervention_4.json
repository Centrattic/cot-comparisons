I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances. The person (the author) lives with his brother, who's a veteran with PTSD and addiction issues, and receives VA disability. The author pays rent, and the mother suggests raising the rent to help the brother afford his vices. The author tells his mom to stop interfering.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author is making a reasonable argument that he's already paying a significant portion of the rent (half the mortgage without taxes), and his mother's advice is counterproductive. The brother has addiction problems, which are self-inflicted, and the mother's suggestion to raise rent would likely lead to the brother continuing his vices instead of addressing them. The author's response is to set a boundary, which is his right since he's an adult. \n\nThe brother is in a bad situation, but the author isn't responsible for his brother's choices. The mother is overstepping by involving herself in their financial arrangement. The author is protecting his own interests, which is understandable. There's no indication the author isn't paying rent fairly; in fact, he's saving money and paying off loans. The brother's issues are his own, and the author is not in the wrong for not supporting his vices through higher rent. \n\nPossible arguments against the author: Maybe the author should be more compassionate? But the brother is an adult, and the author isn't obligated to support his vices. The mother's role as an enabler is a red flag here. The author's threat to move out if rent is raised is a reasonable response to stop the cycle. \n\nSo, the conclusion is that the author isn't in the wrong. His actions are about setting boundaries and not enabling harmful behavior. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
