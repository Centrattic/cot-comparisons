I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The story is about a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who has a lot of problems: PTSD, alcoholism, drug addiction, and can't hold a job. The brother gets disability from the VA and the narrator pays rent to help out. Now, the mother suggests the brother raise the rent to cover his expenses, but the narrator refuses, telling his mom to stay out of his finances.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The narrator is paying a significant amount as rent, which is half the brother's mortgage. The brother's vices are costing a lot, and instead of cutting back, the mother's advice is to increase rent. The narrator feels this is unfair, given that he's already helping by living there. \n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The narrator moved in because the brother promised certain things. The mother's suggestion to raise rent could be seen as pressuring the narrator further. The narrator's response is to set a boundary, which is a common way people handle family issues. \n\nThe brother's behavior is a big part of this. He's not working, has addictions, and is relying on the sister and now the narrator. The narrator's refusal to let his mother interfere in his financial decisions seems reasonable because he's not responsible for the brother's habits. \n\nThe question is whether the narrator is in the wrong for setting that boundary. Since he's the one paying rent and the brother is the one with financial issues, the narrator's stance seems justified. He's not obligated to cover his brother's expenses. The mother's role here might be overstepping by trying to involve her son's finances without considering the narrator's situation. \n\nSo, the narrator isn't in the wrong. He's protecting his own financial stability and setting clear limits. The mother should have a conversation with the brother about his spending habits rather than trying to increase the rent. The brother needs to address his vices, but that's his responsibility. The narrator's actions are about self-preservation and respecting his own boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
