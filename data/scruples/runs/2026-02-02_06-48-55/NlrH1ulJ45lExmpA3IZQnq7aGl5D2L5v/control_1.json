I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is living with his brother, paying rent, and his mother is telling the brother to raise the rent so he can afford his vices. The author is upset about this and told his mom to stay out of his finances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The author is 35, works full-time but makes low money. His brother is on VA disability, has addiction issues, and spends a lot on drugs and alcohol. The brother originally asked the author to move in, offering some perks like a garage spot and future basement apartment. The author is paying $400 a month, which the author says is half the brother's mortgage without taxes, so maybe the brother's total mortgage is around $800? But the brother's disability is twice what the author makes, and the author says he makes enough in two weeks to cover the brother's monthly vices. \n\nThe mother's suggestion is to raise the rent so the brother can afford his home and vices. The author is against this, thinking that the brother should cut down on vices or work. The author is also considering moving out if the rent is raised, which would mean the brother would lose that income and the mother would have to support him instead.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's autonomy over their finances and the mother's interference. The author is essentially saying that they shouldn't have to subsidize their brother's bad habits. The brother is an adult with his own responsibilities, and the mother's advice is enabling his destructive behavior. The author is standing up for their own financial well-being and not wanting to be used as a financial crutch for the brother's issues.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it seems the author is not in the wrong. They moved in to help the family, but it's not their responsibility to support their brother's addictions. The mother's suggestion is essentially making the author pay more so that the brother can continue his harmful habits, which isn't just or ethical. The author has the right to set boundaries around their finances, especially since they are already contributing and facing their own financial struggles.\n\nAlso, the brother's behavior is self-destructive, and the mother's approach is enabling that rather than encouraging him to address his problems. The author is pointing out the hypocrisy here\u2014helping out by living there but not being complicit in the brother's vices. The author's threat to move out if the rent is raised seems reasonable as it removes their financial support from the brother's harmful lifestyle without the mother's interference.\n\nSo, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. They are protecting their own financial autonomy and not enabling their brother's addiction through their mother's misguided advice.\n"
