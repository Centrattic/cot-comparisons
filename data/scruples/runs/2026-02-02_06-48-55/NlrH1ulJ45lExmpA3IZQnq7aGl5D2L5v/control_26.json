I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances in the given situation. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is 35, living in his brother's home, paying $400 a month rent. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict, living off VA disability. The brother's expenses on vices are significant, and he's not working. The mother suggests raising the rent to help him afford his habits, but the author refuses, saying he'll move out if needed.\n\nThe key points here are the dynamics between family members, the financial responsibilities, and the author's justification. The author feels betrayed because he moved in to help the family, and now his mother is trying to increase his rent to support his brother's addictive behaviors. The author argues that his brother's vices are self-inflicted and that he shouldn't have to subsidize them.\n\nLegally, the brother is the landlord, so he can set the rent. However, the author is paying a fraction of the mortgage, and the mother's suggestion to raise rent could be seen as exploiting the family situation. The author's response is to threaten moving out, which is his right. Ethically, is it fair for the author to be expected to pay more for someone else's vices? The brother isn't working, so the author is essentially subsidizing his brother's lifestyle, which may not be fair. The mother's role as an enabler is questionable, pushing for higher rent instead of addressing the brother's addiction. The author's stance is about protecting his own finances and not enabling destructive behavior.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is standing up for himself and setting boundaries. He's not in the wrong for wanting to avoid being financially responsible for his brother's addiction. The mother and brother's behavior is problematic, and the author's reaction is reasonable. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
