I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is living with his brother, paying rent, and the brother has some serious issues with substance abuse and not working. The brother can't hold a job because of his addictions and is getting disability payments from the VA. The mother suggests increasing the rent to help the brother afford his expenses, but the author is upset and tells his mother to stay out of his finances, even threatening to move out if the rent goes up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is paying rent to his brother, who is both his landlord and family member. The brother is struggling with addictions and not working, which is causing financial strain. The mother's advice to raise the rent might be coming from a place of trying to help her son (the brother) but without addressing the root issues of addiction and unemployment. \n\nThe author feels betrayed because he moved in to help the family, expecting certain benefits like a garage space and a future basement apartment. Instead, the mother's suggestion to increase rent seems to undermine that original arrangement. The author is essentially saying he's not going to subsidize his brother's vices through higher rent. He's also pointing out that he's working hard, saving, and paying off loans, while the brother isn't contributing meaningfully. \n\nIs the author selfish for not wanting to pay more? Well, he's in a position where he's already paying a significant portion of the mortgage. If the brother is getting VA disability for being a veteran, perhaps the mother's idea is flawed because the brother should be able to maintain his home with that income. However, the brother's expenses on drugs and alcohol are high, which is a personal choice. The author isn't responsible for his brother's addictions. \n\nThe author's response to tell his mother to stay out of his finances seems justified because it's his money. He's not obligated to support his brother's habits. The mother's advice might complicate the living arrangement and create conflict. The author is asserting his right to manage his own finances without family interference, especially when the situation was already a favor to his brother. \n\nThe brother's inability to work due to addiction is his own issue, and the author isn't responsible for fixing that. The mother's suggestion to raise rent doesn't address the root problem and might be enabling the brother's behavior. So, the author is protecting his own interests, which is reasonable. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's standing up for himself and not allowing his family to pressure him into a financial arrangement that supports someone else's vices. It's about personal responsibility and boundaries.\n"
