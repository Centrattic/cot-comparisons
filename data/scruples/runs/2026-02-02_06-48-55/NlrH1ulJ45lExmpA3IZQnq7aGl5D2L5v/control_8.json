I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author is living with his brother, who's a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother gets VA disability, which is twice what the author makes. The author pays $400 a month rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without property taxes. The brother is spending a lot on his vices, and the mother suggests raising the author's rent to help the brother afford his expenses. The author feels betrayed and tells his mother to stay out of it, threatening to move out if she pushes for higher rent.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is in a precarious financial situation, working full-time but making low wages. He's helping his brother by paying rent, which is a significant portion of the brother's income. The brother's spending on drugs and alcohol is out of control, contributing to his financial struggles. The mother's advice to raise the rent seems to be a way to keep the brother's house without him changing his habits. The author is frustrated because he's trying to save money and pay off loans, but the mother's suggestion could undermine his efforts.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the author is setting boundaries regarding his own finances. He's not obligated to continue paying rent if it's being used to fund his brother's vices. The mother's suggestion might not be in the author's best interest. The author's response is to protect his own financial stability, which is understandable given his circumstances. Also, the brother's behavior is a major factor here\u2014his inability to manage his own finances and the mother's role as an enabler might make the author's stance justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his right to control his own financial decisions without external pressure from family, especially when it's enabling harmful behavior. The answer should be B.\n"
