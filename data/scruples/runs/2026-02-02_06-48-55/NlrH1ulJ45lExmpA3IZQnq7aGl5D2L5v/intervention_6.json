I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is living with his brother, who has a VA disability and uses his income for vices like alcohol and drugs. The brother and the author's mother suggested raising the author's rent to help the brother afford his expenses. The author tells his mother to stop interfering in his finances and says he'll leave if she does. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is paying rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without taxes. The brother has a higher income from the VA, which is meant to support his disability. However, the brother is using that money for drugs and alcohol, which is a problem. The author is in a situation where he's contributing, but the mother is trying to get him to pay more to help the brother's vice money. \n\nThe key points are about financial independence and boundaries. The author is trying to manage his own finances, which is reasonable. The mother's suggestion to raise rent could be seen as a way to help the brother, but it's putting the burden on the author. The brother's addiction is his own issue, and the author isn't responsible for it. \n\nThe author's response was to tell the mother to stay out of his finances. That seems justified because the mother is using her influence to change the rent, which the author isn't comfortable with. The author is also considering moving out if the rent is raised, which is a logical step since his original arrangement was to help the brother, not to subsidize his vices. \n\nBut maybe the mother is trying to help the brother, and the author is being selfish? However, the brother is an adult with a disability and addiction. The author isn't legally obligated to support him financially beyond what he's already doing. The mother's approach could be enabling the brother's bad habits by encouraging him to take more money from the author instead of addressing his addiction. \n\nThe author's stance is about protecting his own financial stability. Since he's making only $870 a month (from the brother's vices) and the rent is $400, raising it would eat into his savings and make it harder for him to pay off debts. The author's threat to move out is a practical response because he can afford to find a new place. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because he's setting boundaries for his own finances. The mother and brother are asking for more than a fair arrangement. The answer should be B (No).\n"
