I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances in this situation. The context is a family dynamic where the author lives with their brother, who has addiction issues and relies on disability. The mother is suggesting raising the author's rent to help the brother pay for his vices. The author is pushing back, saying they won't let their finances be used for that.\n\nFirst, the author is paying rent, which is a significant amount relative to their income. They\u2019re working full-time but making low money. The brother is getting disability, which is more than the author's income, but he's spending a lot on drugs and alcohol. The mother's advice is to increase the rent so the brother can afford his home and vices, which the author sees as a betrayal. The author is setting boundaries, which is understandable given their own financial struggles.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author didn't agree to their rent money being used to fund their brother's addictions. The mother is trying to involve the author's finances without their consent. The author is essentially saying, \"I'm not responsible for his problems, and I won't let my money be used this way.\" That seems reasonable. The brother also made promises he didn't keep, which adds to the author's frustration.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother might be trying to help the brother, but her method is using the author's resources without their agreement. The author is protecting their own financial well-being, which is a valid choice. There's no indication the author is being cruel or unfair; they're setting clear limits. So, I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
