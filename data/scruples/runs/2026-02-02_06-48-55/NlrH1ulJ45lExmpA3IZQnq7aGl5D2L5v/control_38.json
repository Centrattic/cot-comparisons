I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is living with his brother, who's a veteran with PTSD and some addiction issues. The brother lives off VA disability, and the author is paying rent to live in his house. The mother, who's an enabler, suggests raising the rent so the brother can afford his vices instead of cutting back. The author tells his mom to stay out of his finances and threatens to move out if the rent is increased.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is providing financial support by paying rent to a family member, which is more than half of the brother's mortgage. The brother's habits are costing him a lot, and instead of addressing those issues, the mother is pushing for raising the rent. The author feels like he's being taken advantage of because he's the one subsidizing his brother's lifestyle, and he's also struggling with low income.\n\nThe author's response was to set boundaries, telling his mother not to interfere. He's essentially saying that he's not responsible for his brother's addictions and that his financial decisions are his own. From an ethical standpoint, people have the right to manage their own finances, especially when they're dealing with a family member's personal issues. The mother's suggestion seems to be trying to shift the burden onto the author without considering his own financial limits or his brother's need to address his habits.\n\nIt also seems like the author is in a position where he's helping out, but there's an imbalance. The brother isn't contributing proportionally because of his vices. The author's threat to move out if the rent is raised could be a way to enforce his boundaries, which is reasonable. People can't be forced to support others' vices, even within a family. The mother's approach is probably enabling the brother's behavior without addressing the root problems.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his right to manage his own finances and isn't responsible for his brother's addiction. The answer should be B.\n"
