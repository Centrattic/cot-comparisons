I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is living with his brother, paying rent, and his brother is struggling with addiction. The mother suggests raising the rent to help the brother pay for his vices. The author tells his mom to stay out of his finances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is paying rent to his brother, who is a landlord here. The brother has significant issues with substance abuse and isn't working. The mother's advice is to raise the rent to help him afford his expenses, but the author feels this is unfair and confronts his mom. \n\nNow, the key points: The author is paying rent to his brother, which is a financial arrangement. The brother is using the mother's suggestion to increase the rent to fund his addictions. The author feels this is a betrayal because he's already helping out by living there for less than market rate. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's contributing to the household, helping his brother, and now the mother is trying to push for higher rent, which he sees as taking advantage of him. The author's response is to set a boundary, saying he won't let his mom interfere. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's standing up for his own financial boundaries. The mother's suggestion might not be in the author's best interest, but is it the author's fault for refusing to be exploited? The brother is a landlord, so the rent should be a business arrangement. However, the brother is clearly in a bad place, and the mother's advice is enabling his addiction. \n\nThe author is protecting himself, which is reasonable. He's not obligated to subsidize his brother's lifestyle. The mother's role as an enabler might be part of the problem. The author's response, while maybe direct, is about maintaining personal boundaries. \n\nI think the author is justified in his stance. So, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
