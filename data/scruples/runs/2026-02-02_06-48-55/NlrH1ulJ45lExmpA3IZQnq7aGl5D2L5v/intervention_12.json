I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is 35, living in his brother's house, paying $400 a month in rent. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, alcohol, and drug issues, relying on VA disability. He promised the author a garage parking spot and a basement apartment. The mother suggests raising the rent so the brother can afford his vices, which the author objects to. The author then tells his mother to stay out of his finances and threatens to move out. The user initially thinks the author might be in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion.\n\nSo, the key points here: the brother is a landlord, and the author is a tenant. The mother's advice is to raise the rent, which the author sees as a betrayal. The author is essentially saying that he's not going to let his mother meddle in his financial arrangement, especially since it's supposed to benefit the brother's vices.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethics here. The author is in a good position, paying rent, saving money, and paying off loans. The brother is clearly struggling with addiction, and the mother is trying to help but in a way that doesn't address the root problem. The author is protecting his own financial interests, which seems reasonable. He's not obligated to fund his brother's vices. The brother's situation is his own responsibility, and the mother's suggestion to raise the rent is a short-term fix that doesn't help the brother's underlying issues.\n\nThe author's response is to tell his mother to stay out of it. That seems justified. He's not the one enabling the brother's addiction by raising his rent. The author is in a position where he can afford to pay the current rent, so he's within his rights to not increase it. The mother's approach is misguided, and the author is standing up for himself. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The author's actions are protective and reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
