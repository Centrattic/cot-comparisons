I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the 35-year-old man) is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances. Let's look at the situation.\n\nFirst, the man lives with his brother, who has significant issues with alcohol and drug use. The brother is on VA disability, making twice as much as the man, but spends a lot on vices. The man pays $400 a month in rent, which is half the brother's mortgage (excluding taxes), and gets a small room, parking, and utilities. He's been saving and paying off loans, so he's managing okay despite low income.\n\nThe brother was in poor shape, so he asked the man to move in, promising things like a garage spot and future basement apartment. Now, the brother is struggling again because of his habits, and the mother is suggesting he raise the rent to cover his expenses. The man feels betrayed because he moved in to help, and he's telling the mother to stay out of his finances, threatening to move out if they try to increase his rent.\n\nSo, is the man in the wrong? Let's consider the key points. He pays rent, but it's a deal where he's helping out a family member. The mother's suggestion to raise rent is to help the brother cover his vices, which the man finds unfair. The man is asserting his financial autonomy here, which is reasonable. He's not the one with the addiction; he's working hard and saving. The brother's own choices led to his financial issues, so making the man pay more because of that seems unfair. The mother's role as an enabler by suggesting this might not be the best approach. The man's response to set boundaries and take action (moving out) is a way to protect his own interests, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the mother's intention was to help her son, but the man feels it's unfair to shift the burden onto him. The brother's own vices are the root problem, not the man's rent. So the man isn't wrong to protect his finances, especially since he's already helping by paying a significant amount. The brother's issues are his own responsibility, and the mother's interference complicates things. Therefore, the man isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
