I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who lives with his brother, paying rent, and his mother suggesting increasing his rent to cover the brother's expenses. The man tells his mom to stay out of his finances. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is 35, works full-time but makes little money. His brother is a veteran with PTSD, alcohol, and drug addiction, living off VA disability. The brother's income is twice what the author earns. The author moved in to help, paying $400/month rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without property taxes. The brother's vices cost around $870 a month, which is what the author makes in two weeks.\n\nThe brother promised things like garage parking and a basement apartment. Now, the brother is struggling because of his habits and the mother suggests raising the rent. The author refuses, saying he'll just move out if that happens.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider rights and responsibilities. The author is paying rent; the brother is the landlord. The mother's suggestion is to use the rent to cover the brother's personal expenses. The author is asserting his financial autonomy.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the author isn't obligated to subsidize his brother's vices. The arrangement was a personal agreement, and the brother isn't using the rent to maintain the house but for his own habits. The author is protecting his financial stability. \n\nThe brother's situation is his own problem, and the mother's role as an enabler by pushing for higher rent is problematic. The author's response is to set a boundary, which is reasonable. He's not at fault for defending his financial interests here. \n\nPossible counterpoints: Maybe the author should help his brother more, but the original arrangement wasn't to cover the brother's vices. The author moved in to help, but the mother's suggestion changes the agreement. The author is within his rights to say no. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
