I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA for \"Am I the Asshole?\") is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances. The situation involves the author living with his brother, who has significant issues with addiction and doesn't work, and the mother suggesting raising the author's rent to help the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is paying rent, which is half of his brother's mortgage but without property taxes. His brother has a VA disability, which covers more than the author's income. The brother's vices are costing him a lot, and the mother is advising the brother to increase the author's rent. The author resists, saying he'll leave if they push for higher rent.\n\nThe main issue here is whether it's wrong for the author to set boundaries around his finances. The brother is an adult, so he's responsible for his own actions. The mother's suggestion to raise the rent is essentially using the author as a financial solution for her son's problems. The author is standing up for himself, which might be seen as self-preservation rather than wrongdoing.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The author moved in with the brother because he was promised certain things like garage parking and a basement apartment. Now, the brother can't fulfill those promises, and the mother is trying to make the author pay more. The author's response is to say he won't allow that and will leave if necessary. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the brother is an adult, so the mother's role as an enabler could be part of the problem. The author is not responsible for his brother's lifestyle choices or financial mismanagement. By refusing to let his rent be increased, he's protecting his own financial stability. \n\nThe brother's addiction is his own fault, and the mother's approach is enabling him by not addressing the root issues. The author is setting a boundary, which is reasonable. So, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong). He's advocating for himself in a situation where others are trying to impose financial burdens on him.\n"
