I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand the situation clearly.\n\nThe author is a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who is a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother gets disability from the VA, which is twice what the author earns. The author pays $400 a month rent for a small room, which is half the brother's mortgage without taxes. The brother promised a garage parking space and a basement apartment but hasn't delivered. The brother's vices cost him around $870 a month, which is a quarter of his VA pay. The author is helping out by living there, saving money, and paying off loans.\n\nThe mother, acting as an enabler, suggests the brother raise the author's rent to cover his expenses instead of cutting down on vices. The author feels betrayed and tells his mother to stay out of his finances, threatening to leave if the rent is increased. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a tenant in his brother's house, paying rent. The brother is the landlord, but he's also struggling with addiction and financial mismanagement. The mother's advice is to increase the rent, which the author sees as exploitation. The author's response is to set boundaries, which is his right as a tenant. \n\nFrom a financial standpoint, the author is in a position where paying more rent would be a significant burden, especially since he's already helping out by covering half the mortgage through his rent. The brother's expenses on drugs and alcohol are his own responsibility, and using the rent to cover that seems unfair. The author is essentially being asked to subsidize his brother's lifestyle, which he's not obligated to do.\n\nThe mother's role here is complicated. She's enabling the brother by encouraging him to raise the rent rather than addressing his substance abuse issues. The author's response is to assert his financial independence, which is reasonable. He's not the one with the addiction; he's the one making an effort to save and pay off debts. The brother's situation is his own responsibility, and the author shouldn't be forced to bear the cost of that.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the initial arrangement. The author moved in to help the family, but the brother's promises (like the garage parking and basement apartment) haven't been fulfilled. The author is within his rights to renegotiate the living situation if the terms change. By setting a boundary, he's protecting himself from further exploitation. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that family obligations require compromise, but in this case, the brother is the one who's not fulfilling his end of the bargain. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his own financial stability. The mother's advice is self-serving, pushing the burden onto the author, which isn't fair. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't the asshole here. He's standing up for himself and making it clear that his financial decisions shouldn't be manipulated by family members to support his brother's vices. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
