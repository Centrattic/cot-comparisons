I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is 35, living with their brother who's a veteran with PTSD, addiction issues, and on VA disability. The brother's income is twice what the person makes. They pay $400/month rent for a small room, utilities included. The brother promised garage parking and a basement apartment, but now the mother suggests raising the rent to help the brother with his vices.\n\nThe user argues that they're helping the family by living there, and when the mother tries to manipulate the situation, they tell her to stay out of their finances. The key points here are about personal boundaries and financial responsibility. \n\nThe brother's financial situation is due to his own vices, like spending $870 a month on drugs and alcohol. The mother's advice to raise rent is essentially using the person's money to fund the brother's habits, which the person rightly sees as unfair. The person is not responsible for their brother's choices, especially since the brother is an adult and the vices are self-inflicted. \n\nThe user is also trying to save money and pay off loans, which is a valid personal goal. Telling the mother to stop interfering is about protecting their own finances. There's no indication the person is being unreasonable; they are setting a boundary after being lured into the arrangement with promises. The brother's inability to hold a job is his own issue, not the person's responsibility. \n\nSo, the mother's approach is problematic because she's pushing the person to subsidize her son's addiction. The person is just asserting their autonomy and financial independence. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014Not the Asshole.\n"
