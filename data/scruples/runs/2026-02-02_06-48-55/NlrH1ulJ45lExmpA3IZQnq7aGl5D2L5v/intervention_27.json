I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. The situation involves their brother, who's a landlord, and the mother suggesting raising the rent to help the brother with his vices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is living with their brother, paying rent, and the brother has significant issues with addiction. The mother, as an enabler, is suggesting increasing the author's rent to help the brother. The author is upset and tells the mother to stop interfering with their finances.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they moved in to help the family, but now they feel exploited. The brother isn't contributing much, relying on disability and struggling with his addictions. The mother's advice seems to be shifting the burden onto the author instead of addressing the brother's problems. The author is setting boundaries, which is about respecting their own financial autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother might be trying to find a solution to support her son, but her approach is problematic. Raising the rent could be seen as taking advantage of the author's situation. The brother isn't working, so relying on the author's rent to cover his expenses is unfair. The author's response\u2014telling the mother to stay out of it and threatening to leave if the rent is raised\u2014is about self-preservation.\n\nEthically, the author isn't wrong for protecting their own interests. They should have the right to control their finances. The mother's suggestion is enabling the brother's behavior, and the author is pushing back against that. The brother's actions are self-destructive, and the author isn't responsible for fixing that. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're setting boundaries, which is necessary for their own well-being.\n"
