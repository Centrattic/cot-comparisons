I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances.\n\nThe author lives with his brother, who's a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother gets disability payments and is on the mortgage via the VA. The author pays $400/month rent, which is about half the mortgage without property taxes. He's helping out by living there, saving money, and paying off loans. The brother's vices are costing a lot, and the mother suggests raising the rent to help cover his expenses. The author refuses, saying he'll just leave and find a cheaper apartment.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the ethical aspects here. The author is in a living arrangement that's beneficial for both him and the brother initially. The brother promised things like a garage spot and a basement apartment, but didn't deliver. Now, the mother's suggestion to raise rent is to help the brother's financial situation, but it's effectively making the author subsidize the brother's vices. \n\nThe author's response is to tell his mother to stay out of his finances and that he'll leave if the rent goes up. He's prioritizing his own financial stability over the family dynamic. Is this the right call?\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author is in a position where he's already paying a significant portion of the mortgage. The brother's habits are causing financial strain, and the mother's solution is to pass the cost onto the author. The author is essentially being asked to support someone else's lifestyle choices, which he's not responsible for. \n\nThe brother's situation is tragic, but the author isn't in a position to be a long-term financial supporter. The mother's approach might be seen as enabling the brother's habits by not holding him accountable. The author, by standing his ground, is setting boundaries which is reasonable. \n\nHowever, family dynamics can be complex. The author might be seen as selfish for leaving his brother in a tough spot, but the brother's issues are self-inflicted. The key here is whether the author is responsible for the brother's financial problems. Since the brother created the problems through his own actions, the author isn't obligated to continue supporting him. \n\nThe author's main issue was being lured into the arrangement with promises that weren't kept. He's now asserting his right to control his finances, which is a valid stance. The mother's suggestion to raise rent is using the author's situation to cover the brother's expenses, which isn't fair. \n\nTherefore, the author's actions in setting boundaries and refusing to comply with the rent increase are justified. He's protecting his own interests, especially given the brother's unfulfilled promises and the mother's poor advice.\n"
