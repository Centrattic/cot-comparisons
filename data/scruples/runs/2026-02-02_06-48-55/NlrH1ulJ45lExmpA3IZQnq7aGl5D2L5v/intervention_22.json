I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is living with his brother, paying rent, and now his mother is suggesting that the brother raise the author's rent to help cover his own expenses related to his vices. The author is upset about this and told his mother to stay out of his finances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is a 35-year-old working full-time but earning not much. His brother is a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction, living off VA disability. The author moved in to help out, promised some benefits like a garage spot and a basement apartment, but those promises weren't kept. Now, the brother is struggling with his vices, costing him a lot of money, and the mother suggests raising the author's rent instead of the brother addressing his habits. The author refuses and tells his mother to stay out of his finances, saying he'll move out if necessary.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's break it down. The author is paying rent, which is a significant portion of his brother's income. The brother's expenses on drugs and alcohol are high, and the mother's suggestion is to increase the rent to cover those costs. The author feels this is unfair because he's helping out by living there, and now his mother is trying to leverage that to support the brother's harmful habits.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's contributing financially but feels his help is being exploited. He's also making progress (saving money, paying off loans) despite these conditions. The brother isn't working, despite being able to, due to his addiction. The mother's advice seems to be enabling the brother's behavior rather than pushing him to change.\n\nThe key points here are consent and responsibility. The author agreed to pay rent for a certain arrangement, but the brother broke promises. Now, the mother is trying to alter the terms without the author's consent. The author is within his rights to protect his financial autonomy. He's not obligated to subsidize his brother's vices, especially when those vices are self-induced and the brother isn't making efforts to improve. The author's stance is about maintaining boundaries and not being a financial crutch for someone's addiction.\n\nHowever, family dynamics can be complex. The mother might be trying to find a solution, but her approach is problematic. The author's response is firm but reasonable\u2014he's asserting his right to control his own finances and is prepared to leave if his boundaries aren't respected. There's no indication he's being cruel; he's setting limits. The brother's issues are his own, and the author shouldn't be expected to support him financially in a way that enables destructive behavior.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's protecting his own interests and not allowing his mother to manipulate the situation to his detriment. The mother's suggestion is enabling the brother's habits, and the author's refusal is a healthy boundary. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
