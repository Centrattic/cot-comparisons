I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, their brother, and their mother. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. He's living off VA disability and has invited the author to live with him, paying rent. Now the mother is suggesting the brother raise the author's rent to cover his expenses, which the author is against. The author tells the mother to stay out of his finances.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is paying a decent chunk of the brother's mortgage (half without taxes) and utilities are covered. The brother's vices are costing a lot, and the mother's advice is to raise rent instead of the brother cutting expenses. The author is upset because they feel they're being asked to subsidize the brother's habits. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they moved in to help the family, but now the mother's suggestion feels like a betrayal. The author is standing up for their own financial autonomy. The brother's situation is complex\u2014disabled, but capable of working yet unable to due to addiction. The mother's role as an enabler is mentioned, possibly enabling the brother's substance use by not holding him accountable.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is protecting their own finances and not wanting to be exploited. The brother's habits are his own issue, and the mother's approach might not address the root problems. The author isn't being cruel; they're setting boundaries. The mother's suggestion could be seen as using the author as a crutch for the brother's problems, which is unfair. \n\nHowever, maybe the mother is trying to help the family, but the method is flawed. The author is within their rights to refuse. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong). The mother's advice is problematic, and the author is justified in asserting their own financial boundaries.\n"
