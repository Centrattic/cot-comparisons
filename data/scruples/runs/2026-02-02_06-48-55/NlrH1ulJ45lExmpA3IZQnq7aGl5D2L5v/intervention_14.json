I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a brother living with his sibling, who's struggling with addiction and financial issues. The key points here are the brother's behavior, the mother's suggestion to increase rent, and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and a drug addict. He lives off VA disability and has expensive vices. He asked the author to move in, promising some future benefits. Now, when the brother is in trouble, the mother suggests raising the author's rent to help cover his expenses.\n\nThe author feels this is a betrayal and tells his mother to stay out of his finances, threatening to move out if the rent is increased. The user is wondering if the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The author is paying rent, which is a significant portion of the brother's mortgage. The brother is not contributing much beyond that, and his vices are costing a lot. The author is trying to save money and pay off loans. The mother's suggestion seems to prioritize the brother's habits over the author's financial well-being.\n\nThe author's response is to set boundaries. He's stating that he won't let his mother manipulate his finances to support his brother's addiction. That seems reasonable because the author isn't responsible for his brother's lifestyle choices. The brother made his own decisions leading to his current situation, and the author isn't obligated to subsidize that.\n\nThe brother initially lured the author with promises that didn't materialize. Now, the mother is trying to further exploit the arrangement. The author defending his financial autonomy by saying no to rent increases is self-preservation. He's not the asshole for protecting his own interests here. The brother and mother are in the wrong for exploiting him.\n"
