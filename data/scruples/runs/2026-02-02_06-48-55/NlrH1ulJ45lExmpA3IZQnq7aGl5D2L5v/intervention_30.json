I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author lives with their brother, pays rent, and the brother has substance abuse issues. The mother suggests raising the author's rent to help the brother afford his vices. The author refuses, saying they'll move out if that happens.\n\nSo, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is in a financial arrangement where they're helping their brother by paying rent, but the brother's habits are problematic. The mother's advice seems to be enabling the brother's bad behavior by making the author pay more. The author's response is to set a boundary, which makes sense because they don't want to subsidize their brother's vices.\n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, the mother is a parent, and the author is an adult. The author has the right to control their own finances. The brother is an adult too, but his choices are leading to the need for more money. The author isn't responsible for their brother's habits. The mother's suggestion is using the author to cover for the brother's mistakes, which is unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the mother is trying to help the family, but her method is wrong. The author standing up for themselves and refusing to be used like that seems justified. They're not in the wrong for protecting their own finances. The brother's issues are his responsibility, not the author's. The author's threat to move out if the rent is raised is a reasonable way to enforce their boundary. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're setting a healthy boundary and not taking responsibility for their brother's actions.\n"
