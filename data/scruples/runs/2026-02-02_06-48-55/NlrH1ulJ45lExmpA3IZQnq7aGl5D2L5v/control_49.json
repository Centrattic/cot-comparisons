I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances in this situation.\n\nFirst, the author lives with their brother, who has significant issues with alcohol and drug use. The brother is on VA disability and uses a lot of the income on vices. The author pays rent, which is a substantial portion of the brother's mortgage. The mother, acting as an enabler, suggests raising the author's rent so the brother can afford his habits. The author refuses, feeling it's unfair and decides to move out if necessary.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author didn't agree to be a financial solution for their brother's problems. They're already paying a significant amount, and the mother's suggestion is essentially asking the author to subsidize the brother's addictions. The author is asserting their right to control their own finances, which is a personal boundary. The brother's issues are his own responsibility, and the mother isn't helping by shifting the burden to the author. The author's response is about protecting their own interests and not enabling the brother's harmful behavior. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to set limits, especially when it's their own money and decisions. The mother's approach is problematic, and the author's reaction is a reasonable self-defense of their financial autonomy.\n"
