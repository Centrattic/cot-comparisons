I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author is a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who's a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother has a VA disability that pays twice as much as the author's full-time job. The author is paying $400 a month towards the brother's mortgage, which seems to be half of the mortgage without property taxes. The brother promised things like a garage parking space and a basement apartment, but hasn't delivered. Now the brother is struggling with his vices, and the mother suggests raising the rent to help him afford his lifestyle. The author tells his mother to stay out of his finances and threatens to move out if she pushes for a rent increase.\n\nSo the question is, is the author wrong for doing that?\n\nLooking at the situation, the author is already contributing financially to his brother's home, which is a significant amount considering his own low income. The brother's habits are costing a lot more than the author's rent. The mother's suggestion to raise rent seems to be a way to help the brother without addressing his substance abuse or employment issues. The author feels betrayed because he helped his brother move in under false promises and is now being asked to pay more despite the brother's own problems.\n\nThe key points here are the author's right to his own finances and the mother's overstepping. The author isn't obligated to support his brother beyond what he's already doing. The mother's suggestion is essentially using the author's money to fund the brother's vices, which isn't fair. The author is setting boundaries, which is a reasonable response. He's not in a position where he should be forced to help cover the brother's expenses just because of family ties. Also, considering the brother's inability to manage his own life, the author is protecting himself from being further taken advantage of.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's setting necessary boundaries and protecting his own financial well-being. The mother's actions are enabling the brother's harmful behavior, and the author has the right to refuse further financial contributions without guilt.\n"
