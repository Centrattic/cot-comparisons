I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. The situation involves the author living with their brother, who has significant issues with addiction and isn't working. The mother suggests raising the author's rent to help the brother afford his vices instead of addressing his problems. The author refuses, stating they'll leave if the rent is raised.\n\nFirst, the author is paying rent to their brother, who's their landlord. The brother's financial issues are due to his own vices. The mother's advice to increase rent is essentially shifting the burden onto the author. The author feels this is unfair because they're already helping by living there and paying rent. They're concerned about their own financial stability and future, especially since they're working hard to save and pay off loans.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author didn't agree to be the solution to their brother's financial problems. The mother's suggestion implies that the author's money should subsidize the brother's lifestyle, which isn't the author's responsibility. The author is entitled to protect their own finances and set boundaries, especially since they're not the one with the addiction or the one receiving government benefits.\n\nAdditionally, the brother's behavior\u2014using the author's presence to maintain his lifestyle\u2014suggests exploitation. The author's decision to leave if the rent is raised is a reasonable consequence to enforce those boundaries. The mother's role as an enabler by suggesting this approach might not be helping the brother address his issues but instead making others financially support his habits.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to control their finances and not be coerced into supporting someone else's vices without their consent. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
