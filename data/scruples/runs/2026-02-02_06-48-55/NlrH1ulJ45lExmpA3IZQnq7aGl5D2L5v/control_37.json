I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nThe author is 35, living with his brother, paying $400 a month rent. His brother is a veteran with PTSD, alcohol addiction, and drug use. The brother gets VA disability, which is twice what the author earns working full-time. The brother's expenses on vices are about $870 a month, which is a quarter of his VA pay. The author is saving money and paying off loans by living there.\n\nThe brother had promised things like a garage spot and basement apartment, but now he's struggling with his habits. The mother suggests raising the author's rent to help the brother afford his lifestyle. The author refuses, saying he'll move out if they try to increase the rent, and that the mother should just support the brother financially.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the mother's suggestion is to raise the author's rent, but that's not addressing the brother's spending. The author is essentially a tenant, paying for this setup. The brother's financial issues are his own, and the mother is trying to shift the burden to the author. The author is protecting his own finances and not taking responsibility for his brother's vices. He's also not in a position to help; his income is low. He's making a rational decision to maintain his financial independence. \n\nThe mother's approach is enabling the brother's bad habits. The author is standing up for himself, which seems reasonable. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
