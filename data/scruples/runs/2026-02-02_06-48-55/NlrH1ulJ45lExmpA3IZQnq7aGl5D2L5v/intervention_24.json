I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by telling his mother to stay out of his finances. The situation involves him living with his brother, who's a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother has a VA disability that pays him twice as much as the author's salary. The author is paying $400 a month towards the brother's mortgage, which is half the mortgage without property taxes. The brother is using a lot of his income on vices, and the mother suggests raising the author's rent to help the brother afford his lifestyle.\n\nSo, the author is upset because his mother is pushing his brother to increase his rent, which is essentially to fund his brother's addictions. The author's response is to tell his mother to stay out of his finances and threatens to leave if the rent is raised. The user is wondering if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is helping out his brother by paying towards his mortgage, which the brother might not be able to manage alone due to his addictions. The brother's vices are costing a significant portion of his disability income. The mother's advice seems to shift the financial burden onto the author, which he's not comfortable with.\n\nThe author's argument is that he's helping the family by living with his brother, and he's saving money and paying off loans. If the rent is increased, he can't afford it, so he'd leave, and the mother would have to support the brother then. The key point is whether it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries regarding his own finances, especially when the mother is encouraging a change that's not in his best interest.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't responsible for his brother's addictions. It's his brother's responsibility to manage his own income and seek help. The mother's suggestion to raise the rent is placing an unfair financial burden on the author. The author is justified in protecting his own financial situation. He's already contributing by paying part of the mortgage and providing help by living there. Forcing him to pay more to fund the brother's habits is unreasonable.\n\nAdditionally, the brother's behavior and inability to work due to his addictions make it his own issue to handle. The author isn't in a position to be the solution to his brother's problems. The author's response is about maintaining his own financial independence and not allowing his mother to manipulate the situation to his detriment.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his own financial boundaries, which is a reasonable and necessary action. The mother's approach is not helpful, and the author's threat to leave if the rent is increased is a logical consequence to enforce his stance.\n"
