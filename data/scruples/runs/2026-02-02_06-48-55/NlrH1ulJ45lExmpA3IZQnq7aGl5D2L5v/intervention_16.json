I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's mother suggesting they raise their rent to help the brother cover his expenses related to his vices. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction, and he has a disability from the VA. The author moved in with the brother, paying $400 a month, which covers half the mortgage without property taxes, and utilities are free. The author is working full-time but making low wages, and has managed to save and pay off loans.\n\nThe mother's advice is to raise the rent instead of the brother cutting his spending on weed, rum, and cigarettes. The author tells the mother to stay out of their finances and threatens to leave if she continues to push the brother to increase the rent. The author feels this is a betrayal because they moved in to help, not to subsidize the brother's vices. The mother's intention is to help the brother, but the author sees it as using them as a cash cow.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The brother is in a tough spot due to his own choices, but he also has a disability. The author is paying a significant portion of the mortgage and utilities, which are essential for the house. If the mother is advising the brother to raise the author's rent, that would mean the author is paying more, effectively funding the brother's addiction. The author's argument is that they were helping in good faith, and the mother's suggestion is unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother might be trying to help her son by making his finances more stable through increased rent. But the brother's vices are a problem because they prevent him from managing his money properly. The author's response was to set a boundary, which is understandable given the situation. They are working hard and not getting much in return for their rent, and they don't want to support their brother's harmful habits.\n\nThe brother's own responsibility is an issue here. He's capable of work but can't hold a job due to his addictions. That's his fault, and the author isn't responsible for that. The mother's advice could be seen as shifting the burden to the author. The author's decision to stand up for their finances is a form of self-respect and personal responsibility. \n\nI think the key points are: the author is in a position where they're helping, but not being compensated fairly. The brother is making poor financial choices, and the mother's suggestion to raise the rent is not a sustainable solution. The author is within their rights to protect their financial well-being. So, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they're setting a boundary to prevent being exploited, and the brother's issues are his own responsibility. The mother might be overstepping, and the author's reaction is justified.\n"
