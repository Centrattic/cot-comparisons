I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The options are A or B, but I need to figure out the reasoning first.\n\nSo the situation is: a 35-year-old man lives in his brother's house, paying $400 a month rent. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and a drug addict, getting disability from the VA. The brother's income is twice as much as the author's, and he uses a lot of it on vices. The mother suggested raising the rent so the brother can cover his expenses and vices, but the author felt this was a betrayal and told her to stay out of his finances, saying he'll move out if the rent increases.\n\nThe author is defensive, saying he was doing a favor by moving in, and now the mother's suggestion is making him consider leaving. The key points here are the financial dynamics, the brother's issues, and the mother's role.\n\nFirst, the author is paying a significant portion of the brother's mortgage. However, the brother is using part of his disability for vices, which is a problem. The mother's advice to raise rent is to help the brother manage his money, but that's essentially exploiting the author to pay for the brother's habits. The author is asserting his independence by refusing to be part of that.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, he's in a family situation where he's contributing to his brother's home. The brother asked him to move in, promising future benefits. The mother's suggestion might be coming from a place of trying to help, but it's not the author's responsibility to subsidize his brother's addiction. The author has the right to control his own finances and set boundaries. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have discussed this directly with his brother instead of his mother. But the brother's pattern of behavior (not working, using vices) suggests he's not in a good place. The author might feel that his mother is overstepping by using him as a financial solution. \n\nThe mother's approach could be seen as enabling the brother's bad habits by suggesting a rent increase rather than pushing him to cut back or seek help. The author's decision to leave if the rent goes up is a valid response to protect himself. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is not in the wrong for setting boundaries. The mother's advice is problematic, and the brother's situation is his own responsibility. The author has the right to prioritize his own financial stability.\n"
