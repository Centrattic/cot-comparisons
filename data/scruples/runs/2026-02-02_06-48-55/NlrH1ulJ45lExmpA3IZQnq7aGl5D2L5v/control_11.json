I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 35-year-old man living with his brother, a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother is on VA disability, and the man pays rent. The mother suggests the brother raise the rent to help with his expenses.\n\nThe man feels betrayed because he moved in to help, expecting some benefits like a garage and basement apartment, which didn't happen. He tells his mother to stay out of his finances and threatens to leave if rent is increased. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The brother is a landlord; the man is a tenant. The mother's suggestion to raise rent is to cover the brother's vices. The man is paying rent, which is a significant portion of his income, and is saving. He's not the one with addiction issues. The brother's problems are his own, and the mother's approach might not be the best way to help him.\n\nThe man's response is to set boundaries. He's not at fault for prioritizing his own financial stability. He was taken advantage of when he moved in under false promises. The brother's addiction is a personal issue, and the man shouldn't be responsible for funding it. The mother's suggestion to raise rent is a way to avoid addressing the brother's problems, which isn't helping him. The man's decision to leave if necessary is reasonable. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
