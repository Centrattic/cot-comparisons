I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who has some issues with addiction and doesn't work. The brother is getting disability payments, and the author pays rent. Now the mother is telling the brother to raise the rent to cover his own expenses, which the author is against.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is paying a significant amount for rent\u2014$400 a month, which is half the brother's mortgage without property taxes. The brother isn't working, has substance issues, and the mother is suggesting increasing the rent. The author is pushing back, saying he'll move out if the rent is raised, which would force the mother to support her son instead.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's in a difficult position. He's trying to manage his finances and help his brother but has his limits. The brother isn't contributing much, living off his disability while spending on vices. The mother's suggestion might not be the best solution for the brother's problems, as it's just a temporary fix. The author is standing up for his own financial stability, which seems reasonable. He's not obligated to subsidize his brother's lifestyle. The brother's vices are self-inflicted, and the mother's approach might be enabling him further. The author's response is about setting boundaries, which is important for his own well-being. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
