I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stop interfering with their finances in a situation involving their brother's home and his vices.\n\nFirst, the author is 35, pays $400 a month in rent, and works a low-paying job. Their brother is a veteran with PTSD, alcohol addiction, and drug use, living off VA disability. The brother initially promised to build the author an apartment in the basement but hasn't kept that promise. Now, the brother is struggling financially because of his vices, and the mother suggests raising the author's rent to help him cover costs. The author refuses, saying they'll move out and the mother can then handle the rent herself.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's role as an enabler. The author feels that their mother is encouraging the brother to take money from them instead of addressing the brother's addiction and job issues. The brother's addiction is costing him a significant portion of his income, and the mother's advice to raise the author's rent is essentially shifting the financial burden onto the author. \n\nThe author's response is to set a boundary, which is understandable given that they are contributing to the household and the mother's suggestion is harmful. The brother's problems are due to his own vices, not the author's. The mother's approach might be enabling the brother's bad habits instead of pushing him to seek help or responsibility. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong for protecting their own financial interests. They are in a position where they can't afford a substantial rent increase, especially when the brother isn't addressing his issues. The mother's advice is misguided, and the author is justified in standing up for themselves. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
