I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The person is 35, works full-time but makes low wages. They live in their brother's house, pay $400 a month in rent, which is half of the brother's mortgage without taxes. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, alcohol and drug addiction, living off VA disability. The brother can work but doesn't hold jobs because he's under the influence. The brother's expenses on drugs and alcohol are about $870 a month, which is roughly a quarter of his VA pay. The brother had promised to build the narrator a basement apartment and offer garage parking, which is why the narrator moved in. Now, the mother is advising the brother to raise the rent so he can afford his lifestyle. The narrator feels betrayed and told his mother to stop interfering in his finances, threatening to move out if the rent is raised.\n\nSo, the question is whether the narrator is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances.\n\nI need to consider ethics, family dynamics, and personal boundaries. The narrator is paying rent, but it's a significant portion of his income. The brother is not in a good place with addiction, and the mother's advice seems to prioritize the brother's habits over the narrator's financial stability. The narrator is in a position where he's trying to manage his own finances, pay off loans, and save. He's also helping his brother by living there, but the mother's suggestion could jeopardize his financial progress.\n\nIs the narrator being selfish? Maybe, but he's also in a situation where his help is being exploited. The brother isn't contributing to his own recovery and is instead relying on his family. The mother's advice could be seen as enabling the brother's addiction by shifting the financial burden to the narrator. The narrator is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. He's not trying to help the brother's addiction by increasing his own rent to support it. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the narrator should be more flexible, considering family. But the brother's addiction is a personal responsibility. The mother's suggestion is not helping the brother address his issues but rather shifting the problem to the narrator. The narrator's response is to set a limit, which is a healthy boundary. \n\nI think the key here is that the mother's advice is enabling the brother's harmful behavior, and the narrator is standing up for himself. The brother should be held accountable for his actions, and the narrator is not at fault for not supporting the brother's vices at his own expense. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
