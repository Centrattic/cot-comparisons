I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a 35-year-old man living with his brother. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction, living off VA disability. The author pays $400 a month rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without property taxes. The brother isn't working because he can't hold a job due to his vices. The mother, being an enabler, suggests raising the rent so the brother can afford his habits instead of cutting down. The author feels betrayed and tells his mother to stop interfering, threatening to move out if the rent is increased.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal responsibility and boundaries. The author is in a situation where he's helping his brother by paying rent, but the brother is using that money for vices. The mother's advice seems to be enabling the brother's behavior rather than encouraging responsibility. The author is standing up for his own financial autonomy, which is a valid concern. He's not taking sides in the brother's issues but is asserting his right to control his own finances without familial pressure. The brother's problems are his own, and the mother's suggestion to raise rent to support those habits isn't fair to the author. The author is essentially saying, \"I'm here to help, but not at the expense of my own financial well-being.\" That makes sense. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
