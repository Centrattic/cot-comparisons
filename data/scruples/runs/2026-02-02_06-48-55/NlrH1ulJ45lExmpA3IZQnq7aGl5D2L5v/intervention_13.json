I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances.\n\nFirst, let me recap the scenario. The author is 35, lives with his brother, pays $400 a month in rent. His brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and a drug addict. The brother gets disability payments which are twice what the author earns. The brother's vices cost him about $870 a month, which is more than the author makes in two weeks. The brother had promised to build the author an apartment in the basement in exchange for living there. Now, the brother's mother is advising him to increase the author's rent so he can afford his vices instead of changing his habits.\n\nThe author feels betrayed because he helped his brother out by moving in, expecting some improvements like a garage parking and basement apartment. His mom's suggestion to raise rent is seen as using the author to support the brother's bad habits. The author told his mother to stop interfering, and if she does, he'll just move out and pay $600 a month.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for doing this. The user initially thought the author is wrong but is unsure.\n\nLet me break it down. The key points are about personal boundaries, family responsibilities, and financial independence. The author is in a situation where he's helping his brother financially, which is a family matter. However, his financial decisions are being pushed by his mother to further support the brother's vices. The author is asserting his right to control his own finances, which is a personal boundary. \n\nIs it reasonable for the author to set this boundary? He's paying rent to live in the brother's house, which is a fair arrangement. The brother is not in a good place, but the author isn't responsible for his brother's vices. The mother's suggestion to raise rent seems to be a way to shift the burden from the brother to the author. The author is saying \"no more\" to that, which could be seen as standing up for himself rather than being the family's financial support system for someone else's issues.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that as a family member, the author has a responsibility to help. But the author hasn't been asked directly by his brother; it's his mother's suggestion. Also, the brother's promises (like building an apartment) weren't kept, so the author is just fulfilling his part of the agreement by paying rent and now is asserting his autonomy.\n\nThe author's decision to move out and pay more if forced is a reasonable response. He's not in the wrong for protecting his own financial interests and setting limits. The mother's approach is enabling the brother's behavior, and the author is pushing back against that interference.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
