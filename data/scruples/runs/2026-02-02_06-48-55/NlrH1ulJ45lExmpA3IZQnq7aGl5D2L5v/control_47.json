I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given story is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 35, living with his brother, who is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and a drug addict. The brother gets VA disability, which is more than the author's income. The author pays $400 a month for rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without taxes. The brother's expenses on drugs and alcohol are about $870 a month, which the author says equals his two weeks of work. The brother can't work because of his addictions. The mother suggested raising the author's rent to help the brother pay for his habits. The author told his mother to stop interfering with his finances and threatened to move out if she continued.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, the author is paying rent to his brother, so if the brother wants to raise the rent, he could, but the author is saying he'll move out if that happens. The author is also saying that the mother shouldn't be involved in his financial decisions. \n\nThe brother is the landlord here. The mother's suggestion is essentially asking the brother to adjust the rent, which affects the author. The author feels this is a betrayal because he moved in to help the brother, and now his mother is encouraging the brother to exploit him. The author is setting boundaries, which is his right. He's financially responsible, paying off debts, and saving. The brother's financial irresponsibility is his own problem, and the author is protecting his own interests. \n\nThe mother's role here is questionable. She's enabling the brother by pushing for higher rent, which doesn't address his addictions. The author is standing up for himself, which seems reasonable. The brother's addictions are his own fault, and the author isn't responsible for fixing that. So the author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the mother is trying to help the family, but her method is poor. The author's refusal to let her interfere is justified. Also, the brother's behavior is self-destructive, so the author isn't obligated to support him beyond paying rent. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
