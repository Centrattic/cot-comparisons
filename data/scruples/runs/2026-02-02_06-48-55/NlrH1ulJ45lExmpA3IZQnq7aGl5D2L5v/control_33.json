I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's 35, lives with his brother, pays $400 a month in rent, and the brother has a lot of issues with addiction and job stability. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, and he gets disability payments from the VA, which is twice what the author makes. The author is saving money and paying off his college loans, which is a good sign.\n\nThe mother, who's the enabler, suggests the brother raise the author's rent so he can afford his own vices and the house. The author is upset about this and tells his mother to stay out of his finances, even saying he'll move out if he has to, since he can find an apartment for $600. Now, the question is whether he's an asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, from a financial responsibility angle, the author is paying rent that's already a significant portion of his income (half the brother's mortgage minus property taxes). The mother's suggestion to increase rent so the brother can fund his addictions seems counterproductive. The author isn't responsible for his brother's spending on drugs and alcohol. If anything, the brother's addictions are the problem here, not the author's rent.\n\nThe brother originally asked the author to move in because he wanted the help. The author did that, even though the conditions (like sharing a home with someone who has substance abuse issues) might not be ideal. The mother's advice is essentially telling the author to pay more to support his brother's destructive habits, which the author is justified in objecting to. The author is within his rights to set boundaries, especially regarding his own finances. Plus, the author is making responsible choices by saving money and paying off debt, which his mother's suggestion could undermine.\n\nHowever, maybe the mother thought she was helping by trying to make the rental arrangement more equitable? But the brother's addiction is the root cause, and the author isn't to blame for that. The brother's financial mismanagement isn't the author's responsibility. The author's response is firm but reasonable\u2014he's not attacking his mother directly but is setting a clear boundary. The mother's role as an enabler is problematic as well, so her suggestion might be enabling the brother's addiction further. The author's threat to move out if the rent is raised is a logical consequence based on his own financial situation. He's not in the wrong for protecting his own finances and not subsidizing his brother's vices. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), he's not in the wrong. The mother's advice is misguided, and the author is justifiably standing up for himself.\n"
