I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who's a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother has a higher VA disability income, and the author pays $400 a month in rent, which is half the brother's mortgage (excluding taxes). The mother suggests raising the rent to help the brother cover his expenses related to his vices.\n\nThe author tells his mother to stay out of his finances and threatens to move out if she pushes for a rent increase. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the author is right or wrong here.\n\nFirst, the brother is the landlord, and the author is a tenant paying rent. The brother's financial situation is partly due to his own vices. The mother's suggestion to raise rent to help the brother manage his expenses seems to suggest that the author should subsidize his brother's drug and alcohol use. The author is within his rights to refuse to support someone's harmful habits through his finances. \n\nEven though they're family, the author isn't obligated to fund his brother's addictions. The brother's problems are his own, and the mother's advice is enabling rather than solving the issue. The author is standing up for himself, which is reasonable. He's not the one with the addiction, so he shouldn't be responsible for covering the costs. \n\nThe brother initially promised a garage spot and a basement apartment, but those haven't materialized. The author is in a good position to leave and find another place, even if it's a bit more expensive. The key point is that the author is not at fault for refusing to support his brother's vices. The mother's role as an enabler is part of the problem here. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. He's setting a boundary to protect his own financial well-being and isn't responsible for his brother's choices. The answer should be B.\n"
