I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances in this situation.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The author is 35, living in his brother's house, paying $400 a month rent. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, addiction issues, and relies on VA disability. The mother suggested raising the rent to help the brother afford his expenses, which includes his vices. The author is upset and told his mother to stop interfering.\n\nSo, the key points here are the dynamics between the siblings and the mother. The author feels he's helping by living with his brother, even though the brother's situation is problematic. The mother's advice to increase rent is seen as a betrayal by the author.\n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong in this. The author is setting boundaries for his own finances. He's essentially saying that he's paying rent for a place that's not as good as what he could get elsewhere. The brother's vices are causing financial issues, and the mother's solution is to raise the rent instead of addressing the brother's habits.\n\nThe author's response is to tell his mother to stay out of his finances. Is that justified? Well, he's an adult, and it's his right to manage his own money. The brother's financial problems stem from his own addiction and inability to work. The mother's approach doesn't address the root cause but shifts the burden onto the author.\n\nThe author is also pointing out that he's saving money and paying off loans, which suggests he's managing his finances responsibly. The brother's request for higher rent could be financially exploitative. The author is protecting himself from being taken advantage of.\n\nIn family matters, boundaries are important. The author is clearly stating his limits, which is reasonable. He's also offering to leave if the rent is raised, which is a logical consequence. The mother's role as an enabler by not addressing the brother's issues and instead suggesting rent increases might be part of the problem.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. He's asserting his autonomy and protecting his financial stability. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
