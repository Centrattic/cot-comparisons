I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances. The situation involves the author living with his brother, who has addiction issues and is receiving disability. The brother's wife, the author's mother, is trying to get the author to pay more rent to help the brother.\n\nFirst, the author is paying $400 a month for a room in a house he doesn't own, and he's helping out his brother, who's struggling with addiction. The mother's suggestion to raise the rent seems to be to help the brother cover his expenses from his vices. The author feels this is unfair, as he's already paying a significant portion of the mortgage and is making less money. He's also saving and paying off loans, so he's not in a position to support his brother's habits.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author moved in because the brother promised certain benefits like a garage and basement apartment. Now, the mother is pushing to increase rent without the brother fulfilling his promises. The author is setting a boundary by saying he won't be used to fund his brother's addictions. Since the brother's addictions are his own responsibility, the author isn't obligated to subsidize them. The mother's role as an enabler might be problematic, and the author is asserting his right to control his finances. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't the one causing the problem. The brother's habits are leading to the financial issues. The mother's suggestion is essentially asking the author to pay more for someone else's vices, which isn't reasonable. The author's response\u2014telling her to stay out of his finances and leaving if needed\u2014is a valid way to set boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
