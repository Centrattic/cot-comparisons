I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. The situation involves the author living with their brother, who has some serious issues like addiction and not working. The author pays rent, which is a significant portion of the brother's income, and the mother suggests raising the rent to help the brother afford his vices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a vulnerable position, working hard but making little money. They moved in to help the family, expecting some improvements like a garage spot and a basement apartment. Now, the brother is struggling with addiction, and the mother's advice to raise rent feels like a betrayal. The author is standing up for their own financial well-being, which seems reasonable.\n\nThe brother is an adult, so he's responsible for his own actions. The author isn't obligated to subsidize his habits. The mother's suggestion to increase rent is essentially using the author's money to fund the brother's addictions, which isn't fair. The author is setting a boundary, which is necessary for their own stability. They have the right to protect their finances, especially since they're already contributing a lot.\n\nBut wait, maybe the mother's intention is to help the brother. However, the method is wrong. Encouraging higher rent doesn't address the root problem (addiction) and instead shifts the burden onto the author. The author is right to push back, as they shouldn't be the one funding their brother's lifestyle. The answer seems to be that the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to manage their own money without family interference, especially when it's being used for harmful purposes.\n"
