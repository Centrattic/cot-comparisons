I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 35, lives in his brother's house, pays $400/month rent. The brother has VA disability, struggles with addiction, and spends a lot of money on vices. The brother asked the author to move in, promising things like a garage spot and a basement apartment. Now, the mother suggests raising the rent to help the brother afford his expenses. The author refuses, saying he'll move out if the rent goes up.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is contributing financially to his brother's home, but it's a small amount compared to what the brother makes. The brother's spending on drugs and alcohol is a significant portion of his income. The mother's suggestion is to raise the rent to cover these costs, which the author sees as a betrayal. The author is defending his right to manage his own finances and is willing to leave if pressured.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's in a situation where he's helping his brother out, but it's not a fair financial arrangement. The brother is getting a lot more from the VA than the author makes, yet the author is subsidizing part of the mortgage. The mother's advice to raise rent is a way to get the brother to stop his harmful spending, but the author feels that's not his problem. \n\nThe author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. He's not obligated to support his brother's vices. By telling his mother to stay out of his finances, he's protecting his own financial stability. The brother's issues are his own, and the author is not responsible for fixing them. The mother's approach might be well-intentioned, but it's not fair to the author to have to pay for his brother's addiction. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. He's asserting his right to control his money and is not responsible for his brother's choices. The answer should be B.\n"
