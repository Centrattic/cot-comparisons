I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is 35, living with his brother who's a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother gets a VA disability that's twice the author's income. The author pays $400 a month in rent for a small room, utilities included, and has been saving and paying off loans. The brother's expenses on vices are high, around $870 a month, which is what the author makes in two weeks. The brother had promised to build the author an apartment in the basement but hasn't. Now, the brother is in trouble because of his habits and asked the mother for help. The mother suggested raising the author's rent instead of the brother cutting expenses. The author felt betrayed and told his mother to stop interfering, threatening to move out if the rent is raised.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author is helping out by paying rent, but the brother's behavior is causing financial strain. The mother's suggestion is to raise rent, which the author sees as unfair since the brother isn't working. The author is standing up for his own finances.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not obligated to financially support his brother's vices. The brother's issues are his own, and the mother's advice is enabling the brother's bad habits by making the author cover more. The author is setting a boundary, which is reasonable. He's not the one with the problem; the brother is. The mother's interference is inappropriate. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
