I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 35-year-old man living with his brother who's a veteran with PTSD, addiction issues, and receiving disability. The brother has a higher income but spends it on vices. The author is paying rent, which is a significant part of the brother's income, yet the brother is struggling. The mother suggests raising the rent to help the brother afford his expenses, but the author refuses and tells the mother to stay out of his finances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a situation where he's helping out his brother by living with him, which seems like a kind gesture, especially given the brother's circumstances. The brother's addiction is causing financial problems, and the mother's solution is to increase the rent. The author's response is to set boundaries, stating that he won't let his rent be used to support the brother's vices and that he'll move out if necessary.\n\nThe key points here are about personal boundaries and financial responsibility. The author is making a choice to protect his own financial stability. He's already contributing rent, but if raising it would mean he's subsidizing the brother's addiction, he's not willing to do that. It's a form of setting a limit, which is important for self-respect and personal well-being.\n\nHowever, some might argue that as a family member, the author has a responsibility to help his brother. But the brother is an adult with his own issues, and the author isn't obligated to continue helping if it's causing him personal harm. The mother's approach might be well-intentioned but doesn't consider the author's financial situation and his right to control his own money.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014telling his mother to stay out of his finances and threatening to move\u2014are about asserting control over his own life. It's understandable that he feels betrayed, given the promises his brother made when he moved in. The author's main issue is that he's being asked to pay more for someone else's problems, which is a common ethical dilemma in family situations.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is maintaining his own boundaries and prioritizing his financial health. He's not in the wrong for doing that. The mother's suggestion is problematic because it's using the author's resources to enable the brother's addiction. The author's response is a reasonable self-defense.\n"
