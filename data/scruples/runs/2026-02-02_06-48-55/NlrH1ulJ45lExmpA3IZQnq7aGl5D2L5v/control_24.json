I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is 35, living in his brother's home, paying $400 a month as rent. His brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and a drug addict, getting disability payments. The brother isn't working and uses a lot of money on his vices. The author is working hard, making less money, and managing to save and pay off loans. His mother suggested the brother raise the author's rent to cover his expenses, which the author refused, saying he'll leave if they try that.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author is helping out his brother by paying rent, but the brother's habits are out of control. The mother's suggestion to raise rent is essentially exploiting the author's situation. The author is standing up for his financial autonomy, which seems reasonable. He's not obligated to subsidize his brother's lifestyle, especially since the brother's issues are self-inflicted. The author is in a position where he can leave if needed, so enforcing his boundaries isn't wrong. The mother's approach is enabling the brother's bad habits instead of encouraging him to seek help. The author's response is about self-respect and not being manipulated. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
