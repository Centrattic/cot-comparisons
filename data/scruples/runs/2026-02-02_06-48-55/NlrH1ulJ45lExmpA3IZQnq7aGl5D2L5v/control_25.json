I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves family dynamics and financial responsibilities. The main character is a 35-year-old man living with his brother, paying rent, and trying to save money. His brother has several issues\u2014PTSD, alcoholism, drug addiction, and isn't working. The mother suggests raising the son's rent to help the brother pay for his vices. The son tells his mother to stay out of his finances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is paying a significant amount in rent (half the mortgage) but feels that his mother is overstepping by suggesting a rent increase. The brother's behavior is self-destructive, and the mother's advice might be enabling his habits. The author is trying to maintain his own financial stability while helping the family. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author has a right to control his own finances. The brother's situation is his responsibility, not the author's. The mother's suggestion seems to be using the author's contributions to cover the brother's vices. The author's response is to set a boundary, which is reasonable because he's not obligated to support his brother's harmful habits. \n\nHowever, family dynamics can be complex. The author did move in to help, but the brother's actions are his own. The mother's interference might be well-intentioned but misdirected. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting his financial autonomy. He's making a logical choice to avoid enabling the brother's addiction. \n\nAlso, the rent increase suggestion is unfair because the author is already paying a substantial amount. The brother's issues need addressing, but it's not the author's responsibility to fund them. The author is prioritizing his own financial health and future, which is valid. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He's setting healthy boundaries and protecting his own interests, which is necessary given the brother's circumstances and the mother's misguided advice.\n"
