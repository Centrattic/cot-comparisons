I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. The situation is that the author lives with their brother, who's a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother gets VA disability and uses that money to support his vices. The author pays rent, which is a significant portion of their income, and has been saving and paying off loans. The mother suggested the brother raise the rent to cover his expenses, but the author refused, saying they'd move out if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is working full-time but making low wages. They live with their brother, who has serious issues but gets disability. The brother uses a lot of his income on vices, and the mother's advice is to raise the author's rent. The author feels this is unfair and tells their mother to stop interfering. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they're helping their brother out by living there, even though they're sacrificing their own financial stability. The brother isn't taking responsibility for his habits, and the mother is enabling him by suggesting raising the author's rent instead of dealing with the root problems. The author's response is to set a boundary and move out if necessary. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother might be trying to help the brother by involving the author's finances, thinking it's a way to support the family. But the author sees this as a betrayal. The brother isn't working and is dependent on the VA, so the mother's solution seems like a way to shift the burden onto the author.\n\nLegally, if the author is a tenant, the brother as the landlord could adjust the rent, but the author is in a family situation where personal dynamics complicate things. The author is essentially paying a large portion of the mortgage, which isn't fair given the brother's circumstances. The author's refusal to let the mother interfere is about protecting their own financial well-being. \n\nThe mother's suggestion to raise rent to cover the brother's vices is problematic because it's enabling his destructive behavior. The author is right to prioritize their own situation and not let family obligations force them into a worse financial position. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is standing up for themselves in a situation where their brother is not taking responsibility. The mother's advice is enabling the brother's addiction and the author is justified in setting boundaries. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
