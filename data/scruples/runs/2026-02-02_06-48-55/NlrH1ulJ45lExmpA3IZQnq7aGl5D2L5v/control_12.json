I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is living with his brother, who has a VA disability because of PTSD and other issues. The brother isn't working and is using his disability money for vices like alcohol and drugs. The author pays rent, which is a significant portion of the brother's mortgage, but the brother isn't delivering on the promises he made, like building a basement apartment or giving the author a garage spot.\n\nNow, the mother suggests raising the author's rent so the brother can afford his living expenses and his vices. The author tells the mother to stay out of his finances and threatens to move out if the rent is increased. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. He's working a full-time job with low pay, paying a lot in rent relative to his income, and trying to save money and pay off loans. He moved in to help his brother, but the brother isn't holding up his end. The mother's suggestion seems to be enabling the brother's bad habits instead of pushing him to be responsible. The author is standing up for himself and setting boundaries, which is understandable. He's not in a position to support the brother's vices, especially when it's coming out of his own pocket.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother might be trying to help the brother, but maybe not realizing how the increased rent would affect the author. However, the brother's situation is self-inflicted. He has the ability to work but isn't due to his addictions. The author isn't the one with the problem, so it's reasonable for him to set limits. The mother shouldn't be pressuring her son to increase someone else's rent to cover her son's (the brother's) vices.\n\nI think the key points here are the author's responsibility to his own finances and the brother's accountability for his actions. The author is not in the wrong for protecting his own interests. He's in a difficult position and is trying to maintain his financial stability while living in an agreement that isn't being honored by his brother. The mother's suggestion is enabling the brother's destructive behavior, and the author is right to push back. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
