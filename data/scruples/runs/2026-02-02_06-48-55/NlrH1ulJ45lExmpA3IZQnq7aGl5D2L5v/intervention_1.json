I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who is a veteran with addiction issues. The brother gets disability money, and the man pays rent. The mother suggests increasing his rent to help the brother pay for his vices. The man tells his mother to stay out of his finances.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The brother is on VA disability, which is a government benefit. He has addiction problems, leading to poor job performance. The narrator is paying a significant portion of the brother's mortgage, which isn't a typical landlord-tenant situation. The mother's advice is to raise rent so the brother can afford his vices. The narrator, in turn, threatens to leave if the rent is raised.\n\nFrom a family dynamics perspective, the narrator is in a tricky spot. He's helping out his brother, but the brother's behavior is self-destructive. The mother's suggestion might be coming from a place of trying to help the brother, but it's not addressing the root issue of his addiction. The narrator is essentially being asked to subsidize his brother's habits, which he's not responsible for.\n\nLegally, if the narrator is paying rent, the terms should be clear. If the brother is the landlord, any rent increase would need to follow proper procedures. However, the situation is more about family and personal responsibility. The narrator isn't obligated to cover his brother's vices. By setting boundaries, he's protecting his own financial stability.\n\nThe mother's approach might be well-intentioned, but it's enabling the brother's behavior. The narrator pointing this out and refusing to be part of that cycle seems reasonable. He's not the one with the addiction; he's the one making an effort to save and pay off loans. It's his money, and he has the right to decide how to manage it.\n\nSo, considering all that, the narrator isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for himself against a family dynamic that's not healthy. The mother's advice is misguided, and the brother's behavior is the real issue here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
