I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. The situation is a bit complex. The author is a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who has a disability and gets VA benefits. The brother's drug and alcohol habits are costing a lot, and the mother suggests raising the author's rent to help cover those expenses. The author refuses and threatens to move out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is paying rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without taxes. The brother isn't working, relying on disability, and spends a significant portion of his income on vices. The mother's suggestion to raise the rent seems to be to cover the brother's expenses, but the author sees this as unfair since he's already contributing and the brother isn't making efforts to cut back.\n\nThe author's main argument is that he's helping by living there, and the brother isn't trying to improve his situation. The mother's advice feels like a betrayal because she's not addressing the brother's issues but instead shifting the burden to the author. The author's response was to set a boundary, which is understandable. He's maintaining his financial independence and not allowing his mother to meddle in his decisions. \n\nThe brother's behavior is problematic\u2014his addiction and inability to work. The mother, as an enabler, might be trying to help but in a way that's not sustainable. The author's stance is about protecting his own finances and not enabling the brother's habits. From a fairness perspective, the author isn't obligated to subsidize his brother's vices. The brother's initial promise of a basement apartment wasn't kept, which adds to the author's frustration.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. He's setting boundaries for himself. The mother's approach doesn't address the root issues, and the author is asserting his right to control his finances. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
