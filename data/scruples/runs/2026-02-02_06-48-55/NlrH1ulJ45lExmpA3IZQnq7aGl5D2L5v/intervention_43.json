I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a 35-year-old man living with his brother, paying rent, but his brother is struggling with addictions and his mother suggested increasing the rent to help him out. The author told his mother to stay out of his finances and threatened to move out if she tried to push for higher rent.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The author is clearly in a tough spot. He's working full-time but making low wages, yet pays a significant portion of his brother's mortgage. His brother's financial situation is due to his own vices\u2014drugs, alcohol, etc. The mother's suggestion to increase rent seems to be a way to balance the brother's expenses, but the author feels it's unfair given that he's already paying a lot.\n\nThe key points here: the author is paying rent to his brother, who is the landlord here. Normally, a landlord can set the rent as they see fit, but the brother is asking the mother to meddle in the rent amount. The author is standing up for his financial boundaries, which is understandable. He's not obligated to subsidize his brother's lifestyle, especially when the brother's habits are causing financial strain. The author's main argument is that he's helping by paying rent but shouldn't have to pay more to cover the brother's vices. \n\nThe mother's role is also important. She's the enabler here, suggesting that the son increase the rent instead of addressing the brother's addictions. That's a red flag because it's enabling the brother's harmful behavior instead of encouraging responsibility. The author is protecting his own interests, which is reasonable. Moving out is a viable option if the rent is raised beyond his means. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to let family pressure dictate his financial decisions. He's in a position where he's already making sacrifices, and he has the right to set limits. The brother's issues are his own to handle, not the author's responsibility. The mother's approach is problematic because it's shifting the burden onto the author instead of addressing the root cause (the brother's addictions). \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer should be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. He's asserting his autonomy and protecting his financial stability. The mother and brother are in the wrong for expecting him to foot the bill for their issues. The author's actions are justified in maintaining his own boundaries.\n"
