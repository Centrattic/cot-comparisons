I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his mother to stay out of his finances in this situation. The scenario involves the author living with his brother, who has significant issues with addiction and unemployment. The mother is advising the brother to increase the rent the author pays to help cover his expenses.\n\nFirst, the author is paying rent to his brother, who is essentially living off VA disability. The brother's habits are costing him a lot, and the mother suggests raising the rent instead of cutting back on vices. The author feels betrayed and sets a boundary, threatening to move out if the rent is increased.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's already helping by living with his brother and paying a significant portion of the mortgage. The brother isn't contributing much beyond the disability check, and the mother's advice seems to exploit the author's situation. The author is essentially protecting his own financial stability. \n\nThe brother's behavior is self-destructive, and the mother is enabling him by encouraging further exploitation of the author. The author is setting a boundary to prevent being taken advantage of, which is a reasonable action. He's not in a position where he should be subsidizing his brother's addiction. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother might feel she's trying to help the family, but her approach is misguided. The author's response, while firm, is about self-preservation. He's not wrong to prioritize his own needs, especially when the brother isn't making efforts to improve his situation. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for himself in a situation where others are not taking responsibility. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
