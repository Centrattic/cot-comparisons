I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is a 35-year-old man living with his brother. His brother is a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother is on VA disability, which he gets twice as much as the author makes working full-time. The author moved in with his brother because he was asked and promised a garage parking spot and a future basement apartment. He pays $400/month rent, which is half of the brother's mortgage (excluding property taxes). The brother's vices cost him around $870 a month, which is the same as the author earns in two weeks.\n\nThe mother, acting as an enabler, suggested the brother raise the author's rent to cover his expenses. The author got upset, told his mother to stay out of his finances, and said he'd move out if the rent increased. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, let's look at the brother's situation. He's on disability, which is a form of income, but he's using it to feed his addictions. The author is paying rent, which is a significant portion of the brother's income. The mother's suggestion is to raise the rent so the brother can afford his home and his vices. The author feels this is a betrayal and that he's helping by staying and paying rent, but his mother's solution is to exploit him further.\n\nThe author's main argument is that he's helping the family by living there and paying rent, but his mother is pushing for more money, which he feels is unfair. He's also pointing out that the brother isn't working despite being able to and that the brother's problems are self-inflicted. The author's response was to threaten to move out if the rent increases, which would make the brother responsible for the full mortgage and his expenses without the author's help.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong. The author is in a position where he's paying a significant portion of the mortgage. If his mother pushes for higher rent, the author would have to pay more, which he can't afford given his income. The brother's situation is his own vices, so the mother is enabling him by not addressing the root problem (addiction) and instead suggesting to take more money from the author.\n\nThe author is standing up for his own financial well-being. He's not wrong to want to set boundaries. The brother is an adult, and the mother shouldn't be dictating financial arrangements between him and his adult son. The author is also not responsible for his brother's addiction; he's helping by living there, but it's not his duty to subsidize his brother's lifestyle indefinitely.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have been more diplomatic. But the question is about being in the wrong. The mother is encouraging the brother to exploit the author, which is not right. The author's response is to protect himself, which is reasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
