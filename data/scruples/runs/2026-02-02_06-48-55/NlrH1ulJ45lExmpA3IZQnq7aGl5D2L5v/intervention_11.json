I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a 35-year-old man, is living in his brother's house. The brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and a drug addict, relying on VA disability payments. The author pays $400 a month in rent, which is half of the brother's mortgage without property taxes. The brother's vices are costing him a lot each month, and the mother is suggesting raising the author's rent so the brother can afford his expenses.\n\nThe author feels betrayed because he moved there to help the family, was lured by promises of a garage parking and a basement apartment, but now the mother is pushing for higher rent. He told his mother to stop interfering with his finances and said he'd move out if needed.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries in family relationships, financial responsibility, and whether the author has the right to set limits. The author is essentially saying that his financial decisions are his own, and he's not responsible for his brother's addictions or his mother's attempts to use his money to support them. \n\nOn one hand, the mother might think she's helping the brother by adjusting the rent, but the author feels it's an unfair burden. The brother's inability to manage his own finances and the mother's role in trying to manipulate the rent could be problematic. However, the author is in a dependent position, paying rent to his brother who is not managing his resources well. \n\nThe author is setting a boundary, which might be necessary for his own well-being and financial stability. He's not responsible for his brother's habits, and if the mother is pressuring him to increase rent, he's right to push back. The brother's promises about building an apartment didn't materialize, which adds to the author's frustration. \n\nI think the author is justified in standing up for himself. The mother's approach is enabling the brother's bad habits and not respecting the author's financial autonomy. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
