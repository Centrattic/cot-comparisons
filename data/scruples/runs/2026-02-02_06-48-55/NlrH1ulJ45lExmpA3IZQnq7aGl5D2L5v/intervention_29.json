I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a 35-year-old man living with his brother, who's a veteran with PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother is on VA disability and makes twice as much as the author. The author pays $400/month in rent, which is half of the brother's mortgage (without taxes), and gets a small bedroom, street parking, and access to common areas. The author has managed to save some money and pay off college loans.\n\nNow, the brother is struggling with his vices: $100 weed a week, two pints of rum a day (which is $11 each?), and a pack of cigarettes a day. That adds up to about $870 a month. The author makes that in two weeks, and it's a quarter of his brother's monthly pay. The brother had promised to build the author an apartment in the basement and offer garage parking, but now he's in trouble and asked their mother for money. The mother suggested raising the author's rent instead of the brother cutting down on his vices. The author felt betrayed and told his mother to stay out of his finances, threatening to move out to a $600 apartment if she tried to get the brother to raise the rent. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at the brother's situation. He's a veteran with PTSD and addiction issues. He's on disability, which is his income. He's using a significant portion of that on vices, which is a problem. The author is paying rent, but the brother is not using his own money to cover his expenses. The mother's advice is to raise the author's rent so the brother can afford his home and vices. The author is resisting this, arguing that he's helping the family by subsidizing his brother's lifestyle and that it's unfair to expect him to pay for his brother's vices.\n\nThe author's main points: He moved in to help his brother, who promised improvements (garage parking, basement apartment). The brother isn't fulfilling those promises and is using the author's rent to support his addiction. The mother's suggestion is to increase rent, which the author sees as a betrayal because he's already helping out, and it's not his responsibility to support his brother's vices. The author is essentially saying that he's not going to take on more financial burden for someone else's issues.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is in a position where he's contributing financially to a household where the other person is not using their income responsibly. The mother's suggestion to raise the rent is effectively making the author subsidize his brother's vices. The author is within his rights to set boundaries around his finances. He's not obligated to support his brother's addiction, even if they live together. The brother's promise of future improvements (basement apartment) isn't being fulfilled, which adds to the author's frustration.\n\nThe mother's approach might be well-intentioned, but it's placing the burden on the author, who is already in a lower income bracket. The author's response is about protecting his own financial stability, which is reasonable. He's not wrong for wanting to live within his means and not having his money used for someone else's vices. The brother has the means to address his own issues (since he's on disability and could potentially get help for his addiction), but instead, he's offloading the problem onto his family. The author is not in the wrong for setting limits here.\n"
