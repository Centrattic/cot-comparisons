I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the original story is in the wrong for telling his mother not to tell his brother to raise his rent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 35, lives in his brother's house, pays $400 a month in rent. His brother has a VA disability, which is twice the author's income, but the brother uses the money on vices like weed, rum, and cigarettes. The brother originally promised garage parking and a basement apartment in exchange for the author moving in. Now, the brother is in financial trouble, and the mother suggests raising the author's rent so the brother can afford his expenses. The author refuses, saying he won't let his mother meddle in his finances.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the brother is the landlord, so he could technically raise the rent. The mother's advice might be well-intentioned, thinking it's helping the brother. The author might feel that his mother is overstepping by suggesting this, especially since the brother's spending is his own problem. The author is also contributing to the household and might not want to pay more when the brother is misusing the money.\n\nOn the other hand, as a family member, the mother might feel she's trying to help her son (the brother) by adjusting the financial situation. The author's refusal could be seen as being selfish or not supporting family. But the author argues he's already helping by living there and paying rent, and he's not responsible for the brother's vices.\n\nKey points: The author is paying a fair amount for the space he gets. The brother's behavior is self-destructive, and the mother's solution seems to shift the problem onto the author. The author is asserting his right to control his finances, which is reasonable. The brother's financial issues stem from his own choices, so the author isn't obligated to subsidize him further.\n\nI think the author is justified in standing up for himself. The mother's suggestion is unfair and doesn't address the root problem (the brother's addiction). The author is not in the wrong for protecting his own financial stability.\n"
