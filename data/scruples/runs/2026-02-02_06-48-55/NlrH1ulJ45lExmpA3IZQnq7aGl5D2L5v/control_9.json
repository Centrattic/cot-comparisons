I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their mother to stay out of their finances. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 35, living with their brother who has PTSD, alcoholism, and drug addiction. The brother is on VA disability, making twice as much as the author, who works full-time but with low pay. The author pays $400 a month rent, which is half the brother's mortgage without taxes, and gets a small bedroom with access to shared facilities. The brother's vices cost around $870 a month, which is about what the author makes in two weeks. The brother had promised to build the author a basement apartment and provide a garage space, but instead, when he can't manage his expenses, the mother suggests raising the rent instead of the brother cutting costs or working.\n\nThe author feels betrayed because they moved in to help the family, and now the mother wants to increase their rent to cover the brother's expenses. The author refuses, saying they'll leave and get their own place if that happens.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries in family finances. The author is essentially saying that their money shouldn't be used to subsidize their brother's vices, even if it's from a well-meaning family member. They're asserting their right to control their own finances, especially since they're helping out under certain conditions (promises of an apartment, parking). The brother isn't fulfilling those promises, and the mother is pressuring the author to pay more rent, which the author sees as unfair.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author isn't wrong in setting boundaries. They've already paid a significant amount in rent and are trying to save and pay off debts. It's reasonable for them to say that their financial contributions shouldn't cover the brother's habits, especially since the brother is capable of working but isn't. The mother's suggestion might be coming from a place of trying to help, but it's not considering the author's personal financial limits and the original agreement.\n\nAlso, the author is not the one causing the problem. The brother's issues with addiction and inability to work are the root causes. The mother's advice is a Band-Aid solution that doesn't address the underlying issues and unfairly places the burden on the author. The author's response to set a limit and be prepared to leave is a valid self-advocacy step.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their own interests in a situation where they've been helping a family member but can't sustain the financial strain caused by the brother's behavior.\n"
