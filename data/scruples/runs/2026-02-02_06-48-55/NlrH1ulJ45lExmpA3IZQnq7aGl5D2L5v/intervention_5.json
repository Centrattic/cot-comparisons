I work full time, but make shit money.  My brother is a veteran with PTSD, an alcoholic, and drug addict.  He lives off of disability from the VA.  He gets paid twice as much as I do to play video games and drink all day.  He got his home and mortgage through the VA.  He begged me to leave my roommates and live with him.  I pay rent.  $400/ a month.  Half his mortgage without the property taxes.  Utilities are free.  I get a small bedroom, street parking, and access to the laundry, bathroom, and kitchen.  Its not terrible, and I have been able to save a bit of money and pay off most of my college loans.  \n\nNow, my brother had hit hard times because his vices are out of control.  He smokes $100 of weed a week.  Drinks two pints of rum a day ($11), and smokes a pack of cigarettes a day.  That is at least $870 a month.  That is what I make in two weeks.  That is only 1/4 his monthly pay.  I should point out that my brother is fully capable of working but cannot hold down a job because he shows up to work high or drunk.  \n\nHe begged me to live here.  Promised parking space in The garage and that he would build me an apartment in the basement.  \n\nNow, he has hit hard time because of his own vices.  He went to my enabler mother for money.  She told him to raise my rent i stead of drinking less or getting a job.  \n\nThis felt like an utter betrayal to me.  I left my friend\u2019s apartment where i was happy because i was lured with off street parking and an apartment of my own in the future to help him out.  I was doing him a favor.  Helping the family.  \n\nThen my mother starts trying to convince him to raise my rent so he can afford his home and his booze and drugs.  \n\nWhen i found out, I felt betrayed.  I told her to stay out of my finances.  I told her that if she convinces him to raise my rent, i will just get an apartment of my own (you can get them as low as $600 a month around here).  I told her that she can then keep my brother afloat and pay the rent I no longer pay.\n\nThis went over really well.  \n\nAm I the asshole for telling my mother not to counsel my brother/landlord to raise my rent to pay for his drug habits?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is living with his brother, paying rent, and his brother has some significant issues with substance abuse. The author's mother suggests increasing the rent to help the brother pay for his vices, and the author tells his mother to stay out of his finances and says he'll move out if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is paying rent to his brother, who is struggling with addiction. The brother is getting disability from the VA, which is a government support system, and he's using that money for drugs and alcohol instead of being employed. The author is essentially subsidizing his brother's home through rent, which isn't a small amount\u2014$400 a month is half the brother's mortgage without taxes. So the author is contributing significantly to the brother's living expenses without getting the full benefits in return.\n\nThe mother's suggestion to raise the rent seems to be a way to help the brother manage his finances, but it's a problematic approach. Raising the rent would take money from the author (through the brother) and give it back to the brother, but since the brother is already misusing his VA disability funds, this might not address the root issue. It could even be seen as enabling his addictive behaviors by using the author's rent money instead of the brother's own disability payments.\n\nThe author feels betrayed by his mother's suggestion because he moved in to help the family and now feels his financial contributions are being manipulated. He's asserting his right to control his own finances, which is a valid point. The author is in a difficult position where he's supporting his brother, but that support isn't helping the brother's behavior. The author's response\u2014telling his mother to stop interfering and threatening to leave if she does\u2014seems like a reasonable boundary.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the mother's advice might not be the best solution, but does the author have the right to refuse to let his mother influence the rent? The author is paying rent to his brother, so the mother isn't directly taking the author's money. However, suggesting that the brother raise the rent could backfire if the author leaves, which would leave the brother without that financial support. The author's decision to set a boundary is about protecting his own interests, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a family situation where there might be unspoken expectations of support. The mother's advice could come from a place of trying to help the brother, but using the author's rent as a solution is flawed. The author's response, while firm, is about maintaining his autonomy. Since the brother is the one misusing his funds, the author isn't at fault for wanting to control his own financial decisions. The author's actions are about self-preservation and not enabling the brother's harmful habits through continued rent payments.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's setting a boundary that's necessary for his own well-being and financial stability. The mother's role here is more of a complicating factor, but the author's response is justified.\n"
