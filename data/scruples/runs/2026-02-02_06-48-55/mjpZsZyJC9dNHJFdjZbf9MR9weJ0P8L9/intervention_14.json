I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the person is asking if the fianc\u00e9 is in the wrong for not wanting his fianc\u00e9e to go to a dinner with her boss. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 is upset because his fianc\u00e9e is going to a dinner with her boss, who's described as a shady figure in a law firm. The timeline shows the fianc\u00e9e gave conflicting information about the event, which leads the fianc\u00e9 to think there's something off. He noticed that the attendees are all young women, and the boss insisted on sending a car service, which makes him more suspicious. The fianc\u00e9e doesn't see the issue, and they're arguing now.\n\nSo, the question is whether the fianc\u00e9 is wrong to be so concerned. From his perspective, he's trying to protect their relationship and his fianc\u00e9e from a potentially problematic situation. The boss's behavior\u2014like last-minute changes, offering a car service that could be a way to control the situation\u2014raises red flags. The fianc\u00e9's concerns are based on the boss's reputation and the circumstances of the dinner.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that her fianc\u00e9 is being controlling. She might see the dinner as a legitimate work event and his reaction as overstepping. She points out the boss is married, which he can't do anything about, but the fianc\u00e9 might still be worried about the potential for any kind of inappropriate situation, even if it's not about the boss's marital status.\n\nThe key here is whether the fianc\u00e9's concerns are reasonable. Given the boss's history and the unusual circumstances (last-minute changes, only young female employees invited, insistence on car service), it's understandable he's worried. The fianc\u00e9e, however, might not see the same risks, leading to conflict.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? If he's acting out of concern for his partner's safety and the integrity of their relationship, maybe not. However, if he's being overly controlling without clear evidence, that could be problematic. The problem is he's not allowing her to make her own choice, even if he thinks it's risky. Trust is a big part of relationships. But if there's a legitimate reason to be suspicious, like the boss's character, then his concerns aren't unfounded.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the fianc\u00e9's actions stem from valid concerns or if he's being controlling. Since the boss is described as shady and the events are suspicious, the fianc\u00e9 isn't entirely wrong. But he also needs to communicate better and maybe involve her more in the decision-making rather than trying to stop her outright. However, given the context, his worries are justified. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
