I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for not wanting his fianc\u00e9e to dine with her boss. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9e works at a law firm with a shady reputation. The boss is known for being unethical, and there are red flags throughout the timeline. The author is concerned about the boss's intentions, especially since the boss insisted on sending a car service, which seems suspicious. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, doesn't see the issue and is pushing to go. \n\nThe key points here are the author's concerns about the potential for inappropriate behavior or manipulation from the boss. The boss's actions\u2014like last-minute changes and providing a car\u2014could be attempts to create a situation where the fianc\u00e9e is isolated. The author is trying to protect his partner, which is a valid concern in a relationship. However, the author's reaction is pretty intense\u2014threatening to break off the engagement, calling the fianc\u00e9e a controlling asshole. That's a lot.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that her fianc\u00e9 is being overly controlling. She might see the dinner as a professional obligation and feel that her partner is undermining her career. But given the suspicious circumstances and the boss's history, the author's caution makes sense. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether his concerns are reasonable. Since the boss has a shady reputation, and there are multiple red flags (like the car service), the author's worry is justified. However, how he's handling it could be problematic. Instead of confronting her with evidence and being confrontational, maybe a more collaborative approach would be better. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about how he handled it. \n\nSince the author is acting out of concern for his partner's safety and the situation is indeed fraught with potential issues, he's not in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's boss has a history, and the circumstances are suspicious. The author isn't just being paranoid; he's reacting to real red flags. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
