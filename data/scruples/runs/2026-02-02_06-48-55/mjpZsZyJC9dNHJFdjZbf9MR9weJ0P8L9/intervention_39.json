I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 not wanting his fianc\u00e9e to go to dinner with her boss, and they're arguing about it. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The fianc\u00e9 is in a high-profile law firm known for controversial methods. The boss is described as an ambulance chaser, which isn't great. The timeline shows that the fianc\u00e9e kept changing the details about the dinner, and eventually, it's just her and another young female employee. The boss insists on sending a car service, which makes the author suspicious.\n\nThe author is worried about the situation because of the boss's history and the way the dinner is being arranged. He feels it's shady and doesn't want his fianc\u00e9e to go. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, thinks he's being controlling and accused him of being an asshole. She's confident that the boss can't do anything because he's married.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are key. The author is expressing his concerns based on the timeline and the boss's behavior. He's not acting out of jealousy but because he's worried about her safety and the firm's reputation. However, he's also taking a firm stance without maybe discussing it calmly. The fianc\u00e9e might feel that he's overstepping, especially if she feels the situation is harmless. \n\nBut the boss's actions\u2014offering a car service after changing the plans last minute\u2014do seem a bit odd. The author's concerns might be valid, especially given the boss's reputation. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reaction is also valid because she might feel her autonomy is being questioned. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. The author has a right to be concerned, but his approach might come off as controlling. The fianc\u00e9e might be in the wrong for not seeing the red flags and brushing off his concerns. But since they're engaged, it's a mutual issue. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having concerns, but his reaction might be too harsh. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering the boss's history and the suspicious circumstances, the author's concerns are justified. The fianc\u00e9e dismissing his worries as controlling might be the bigger issue here. So the author isn't in the wrong for the concerns, but maybe his approach could be better. But the core question is if he's in the wrong. Since he's acting out of legitimate concerns, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
