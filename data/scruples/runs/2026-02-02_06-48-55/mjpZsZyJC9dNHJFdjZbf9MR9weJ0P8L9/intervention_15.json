I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 not wanting her to go to a dinner with her boss, leading to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm with a shady reputation. The boss is known for being an ambulance chaser. The fianc\u00e9 was initially planning to take her SO (the author) to the dinner but later changed her mind, then clarified it's just a work party, then it's only certain people. The author notices that the invitees are young females, and the boss insists on sending a car service, which makes him suspicious. He objects, she calls him controlling. The author thinks there's something fishy and refuses to let her go, leading to a breakup threat.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be wrong but wants my opinion. I need to consider both sides. The author's concern is about the boss's behavior being inappropriate, especially with the history of the firm and the boss's character. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, thinks the author is being too controlling and doesn't see the issue.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. The author is showing concern for his fianc\u00e9's safety and the potential for harassment or inappropriate situations. The fianc\u00e9's boss's history raises red flags. The timeline shows the author is trying to gather information and understand the situation, which is reasonable. However, the way he's reacting\u2014calling it \"shady as fuck,\" not allowing her to go, leading to an argument where he's called a controlling asshole\u2014could be seen as overstepping if he's not giving her the autonomy. \n\nBut considering the boss's history and the suspicious circumstances (only young female employees invited, last-minute car service), the author has legitimate reasons to be concerned. The fianc\u00e9's dismissal of these concerns and insistence on going might be more problematic. The author's actions are protective, but the method of handling it could be seen as controlling. However, given the context, maybe he's justified in his suspicion.\n\nIn AITA posts, often the person who has a valid concern but handles it poorly is not entirely at fault. The author is trying to protect his fianc\u00e9 from a potentially risky situation, even if his approach is confrontational. The fianc\u00e9's boss's behavior and the firm's reputation add layers to the situation. The author's actions are motivated by genuine concern, so while his reaction might be intense, he's not in the wrong if the situation is indeed risky. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to see the warning signs and her own admission that there are implications (by saying the boss can't do anything that affects his marriage) suggests she also has some understanding but is choosing to ignore it.\n\nSo, the answer is likely that the author is not in the wrong (B). He has valid reasons based on the boss's history and the suspicious setup of the dinner. The fianc\u00e9's response is dismissive and possibly putting herself in a compromising position. The author's protective instincts, though maybe expressed poorly, are justified given the context.\n"
