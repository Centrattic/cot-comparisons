I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting her to go to a dinner with her boss. The author (the fianc\u00e9) has given a detailed timeline of how the plans for the dinner changed, leading to suspicion. The boss started by inviting the fianc\u00e9's partner, then changed his mind, then it turned out only a select few were invited, specifically young women, and the boss offered a car service which the author found suspicious. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and considers calling off the engagement, while the partner is upset with him for being controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is concerned about the potential for inappropriate situations given the boss's known reputation and the way the dinner was arranged. The boss is known for aggressive legal tactics and has a reputation as a scammer. The author's concerns might be valid because the boss is in a position of power, and the fianc\u00e9 is a young female employee in a male-dominated field. The fact that the dinner is only with certain young female employees raises red flags about possible ulterior motives.\n\nHowever, the author's reaction is also intense. He's threatening to break off the engagement, calling the fianc\u00e9 a controlling asshole, and she's feeling cornered. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that her partner is overreacting and not trusting her. It's important to note that the fianc\u00e9 has accepted the invitation and dismissed his concerns, which could lead to conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's concerns aren't baseless. The boss's actions\u2014changing the invitation details, offering a car service\u2014could be seen as attempts to create a private setting, which is concerning given the power dynamic. The fianc\u00e9's job at a law firm with such a boss adds to the potential for exploitation.\n\nBut where is the line between justified concern and overstepping? The author is expressing his discomfort and wanting to protect his fianc\u00e9, which is understandable. However, he's also making decisions for her, not allowing her to attend, which could be seen as controlling. Trust in a relationship is important, so if she feels that he's not respecting her decisions, that's a problem. At the same time, if the situation truly has red flags, he's justified in being cautious.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's response\u2014that the boss is married and can't act on any impropriety\u2014might be an attempt to reassure him, but it's not a solid argument. It doesn't negate the possibility of inappropriate behavior, just that the boss might not want to risk his marriage. However, the author's reaction to that reassurance by escalating the situation could be problematic.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. It seems like they didn't discuss the concerns adequately beforehand. The author's approach of not letting her go and calling her a controlling asshole is harsh. He might have a valid point about the situation being shady, but his method of handling it is extreme. The fianc\u00e9 might also be in the wrong for dismissing his concerns and not considering the implications, especially given the boss's history.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's not entirely. His concerns are valid given the circumstances. However, his response\u2014threatening to break off the engagement and acting unilaterally\u2014might be too harsh. He should have tried to discuss it with her and come to a mutual decision rather than making the final call. On the other hand, her dismissing his concerns and not seeing the red flags might also be part of the problem. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the author. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's not entirely the case. The author's actions stem from valid concerns, even if he handled it poorly. So maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if the fianc\u00e9 is within her rights to attend the dinner and the author is overstepping, then he would be in the wrong. But given the boss's reputation and the suspicious setup, it's hard to say he's entirely wrong.\n\nI think the answer is a balance, but since the question is a yes/no for the author being in the wrong, and considering the potential for the boss to exploit, the author might not be in the wrong. However, his approach is problematic. But given the options A or B, the user is asking for a choice. Maybe the correct answer is B (not in the wrong) because his concerns are reasonable, even if his handling of it is flawed.\n"
