I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to go to dinner with her boss. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm that's known for maybe unethical practices. The boss is described as an ambulance chaser, which immediately raises red flags. The author is concerned about the boss's intentions, especially after a series of conflicting information about the dinner invitation. The boss initially says the significant others are invited, then changes his mind, and then arranges a car service, which seems suspicious. The fianc\u00e9 is going with the boss, and the author is worried about potential impropriety or harassment.\n\nThe author's main issue is the timeline of the invitations and the boss's actions. The fact that the boss is sending a car service on the day of the event, after changing plans multiple times, could indicate that the dinner is more than just a celebration. The author is trying to protect their fianc\u00e9 from a potentially uncomfortable or dangerous situation. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, doesn't see the issue and is upset that the author is being controlling.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, from the author's perspective, they're acting out of concern for their partner's safety and the integrity of their relationship. The boss's behavior does seem shady\u2014changing plans, selective invitations, arranging transportation last minute. The author is pointing out these inconsistencies and trying to prevent a situation that could lead to problems. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels that the author is being overbearing and controlling. \n\nBut considering that the boss is married, and the author's fianc\u00e9 is being singled out for a dinner with him, especially under these circumstances, the author's concerns are valid. The author is trying to protect their partner from a potentially inappropriate situation. The fianc\u00e9's dismissive reaction might indicate she's not aware of the risks or is downplaying them. In relationships, trust and communication are key, but there's also a responsibility to address red flags, especially in professional settings where power dynamics are at play. \n\nSo, the author isn't being unreasonable here. They're reacting to a series of suspicious events. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is being too controlling, but given the boss's reputation and the circumstances, the author's actions are justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
