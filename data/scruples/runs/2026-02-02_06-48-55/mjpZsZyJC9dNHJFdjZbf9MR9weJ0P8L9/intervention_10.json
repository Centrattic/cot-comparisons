I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 not wanting her to go to a dinner with her boss. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The fianc\u00e9 is working at a law firm, and the boss is known for being shady. The author of the post is the fianc\u00e9's partner, and he's upset about the sudden changes in the event details, the selection of attendees (young, female), and the last-minute car service offer from the boss. He's interpreting these things as potentially problematic, maybe even a setup for something inappropriate. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, is dismissing his concerns, calling him controlling, and wants to go. The author is considering breaking off the relationship because of this conflict.\n\nSo the question is: is the author right to be concerned, or is he overreacting (hence being the asshole)? \n\nIn relationships, trust is a big factor. The author is acting on his intuition that something is off, based on the timeline and the boss's behavior. The boss's actions\u2014like sending a car service after the fianc\u00e9 mentions her partner driving\u2014could be seen as trying to create a private setting, which is a red flag. The fact that only young female employees are invited might also contribute to the author's suspicion. \n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9 doesn't see the same red flags and is confident that everything is okay. She even points out that the boss is married and can't risk his marriage. The author's reaction might be seen as controlling if he's not giving her the benefit of the doubt. But if there are valid reasons to be concerned (like the boss's history and the suspicious setup), then the author might be justified.\n\nIn many cases where someone is accused of being controlling, it's about whether the concerns are based on real issues or just jealousy. Here, the author has specific details that suggest the boss's behavior could be problematic. The boss's quick response and the changing plans add to the unease. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is making a big deal out of this and threatening to end the relationship, which might be an overreaction if the fianc\u00e9 is genuinely not seeing any issues and the situation is innocent. However, given the boss's reputation and the suspicious circumstances, it's not unreasonable for the author to have concerns.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's concerns are reasonable. If the boss's actions are indeed questionable, then the author isn't in the wrong for trying to protect his fianc\u00e9. However, if there's no evidence of wrongdoing and the author is just being overly paranoid, then he might be the one being unreasonable. \n\nGiven the information, the boss's behavior does seem sketchy, so the author's concerns are valid. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to prevent his fianc\u00e9 from being in a potentially dangerous situation. The fianc\u00e9, meanwhile, might be dismissing legitimate concerns, which could be her issue. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
