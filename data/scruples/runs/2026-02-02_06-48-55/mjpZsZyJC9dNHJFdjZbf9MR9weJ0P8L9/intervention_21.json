I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting his fianc\u00e9 to go to dinner with her boss. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The fianc\u00e9 got invited to a dinner with her boss, which was supposed to be a celebration of the company's biggest year. The timeline is a bit confusing, with the fianc\u00e9 changing her story about who's invited. At first, she says the SOs are invited, then it's just a work party, then it's only certain people. Then it turns out the invitees are mostly young women. The boss arranges a car service, which makes the author suspicious. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't see the problem and wants to go, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe author is frustrated and considering breaking off the engagement because he feels this is a red flag. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and calls him controlling. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nNow, thinking about typical relationship dynamics. Jealousy or controlling behavior can be problematic. If the author is overreacting without solid evidence, he might be in the wrong. But there are some red flags here: the boss is known for shady behavior, the dinner only includes young female employees, the last-minute change to a car service, which could be a way to prevent spouses from coming. \n\nThe author's concerns might be valid. It's possible the boss is trying to create an opportunity for inappropriate interactions. The fianc\u00e9 downplays the situation, which could indicate she's either unaware or not taking his concerns seriously. However, the author is making decisions for her, telling her she can't go, which is controlling. He should discuss it with her instead of unilaterally deciding. \n\nOn one hand, the author has legitimate concerns about the situation. On the other hand, he's being controlling by not allowing her to make her own choice. The key is whether his actions are based on valid concerns or just jealousy. The situation has elements that are concerning, so maybe his reaction isn't entirely unwarranted. But taking away her agency is problematic. \n\nHmm. So, is the author in the wrong? If he's preventing her from going without her consent, that's controlling. But if the situation is genuinely risky, maybe he's justified. But in a healthy relationship, you discuss concerns and make decisions together. He shouldn't dictate her actions. So maybe the author is in the wrong for being controlling, even if his concerns are valid. The fianc\u00e9 might need to take his concerns seriously, but he shouldn't force her to stay home. \n\nSo the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong for being controlling, but there's nuance. But the question is straightforward, answer A or B. Given that, maybe A is correct because controlling behavior is wrong, even if the concerns are valid.\n"
