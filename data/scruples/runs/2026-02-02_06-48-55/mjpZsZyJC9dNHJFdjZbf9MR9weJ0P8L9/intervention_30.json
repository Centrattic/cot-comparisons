I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether the fianc\u00e9 should go to a dinner with her boss. The author is really frustrated and even says they might break off the engagement because of this.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm with a boss who has a shady reputation. The author is clearly uncomfortable with the boss's behavior, especially since the boss is offering a car service for the dinner. The timeline shows that the fianc\u00e9 kept changing the details about the event, which might have made the author suspicious. The author points out that only two people are being invited\u2014both young women\u2014and the boss is pushing for the car service, which could be a red flag.\n\nThe author's reaction is based on distrust of the boss and concern about the situation being inappropriate. They tried to communicate their concerns using the timeline and evidence from the fianc\u00e9's own messages. The fianc\u00e9, however, dismisses these concerns and accuses the author of being controlling. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, the author has valid concerns given the boss's reputation and the unusual circumstances. On the other hand, the author is making a decision for the fianc\u00e9, not allowing her to make her own choice, which could be seen as controlling. The fianc\u00e9's boss is married, and the author argues that he wouldn't risk his marriage, but that's an assumption. \n\nHowever, the key point is whether the author has the right to dictate the fianc\u00e9's actions. The author is trying to protect their partner, but respecting each other's autonomy is important in a relationship. The author's approach might be overstepping, especially if they're not giving the fianc\u00e9 the chance to assess the situation herself. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that her judgment is being undermined. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If the author can't trust the fianc\u00e9 to handle situations like this, it might indicate deeper issues. The author's reaction is intense, leading to a potential breakup, which is a big step. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether their concerns are justified and how they handle the communication. \n\nGiven that the boss's behavior is questionable and the author has legitimate reasons to be concerned, but the method of handling it by forbidding the fianc\u00e9 from attending might be too controlling. The author's intent is protective, but the execution lacks mutual discussion and respect for the fianc\u00e9's autonomy. So the author is partially at fault for not addressing the issue in a more collaborative way. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
