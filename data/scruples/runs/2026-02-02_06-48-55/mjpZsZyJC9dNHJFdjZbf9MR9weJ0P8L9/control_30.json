I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 not wanting his partner to go to a dinner with her boss. Let me look at the details.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm known for its controversial reputation. The boss is described as an ambulance chaser, which immediately raises red flags. The timeline shows that the boss kept changing the story about the dinner, initially saying the fianc\u00e9e's partner could come, then not, then narrowing the invite to young female employees. The boss even arranges a car service last minute, which seems suspicious. The fianc\u00e9 is concerned about the boss's intentions, especially since the boss is married but maybe could be taking advantage of a situation with a vulnerable employee.\n\nThe author of the post (the fianc\u00e9) is worried about his partner being in a potentially compromising situation. He points out the inconsistencies in the event's setup and the boss's behavior. His fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, dismisses his concerns, calls him controlling, and wants to go. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction suggests she might be aware of the boss's possible intentions but still chooses to attend, which is concerning.\n\nNow, considering the context, the author is voicing legitimate concerns about his partner being placed in a scenario where there could be ethical issues or harassment. The boss's actions\u2014changing the event details, selecting only young female employees, arranging a car service\u2014do indicate something shady. The author is trying to protect his partner, not being controlling without reason. The fianc\u00e9e's dismissive attitude and the boss's history add weight to the author's concerns.\n\nHowever, the author might be overreacting if there's no direct proof of wrongdoing. But given the suspicious circumstances and the boss's reputation, it's reasonable for him to be cautious. The key here is whether the author's actions are based on valid concerns or just jealousy. The evidence presented by the author (changing plans, targeted invitations, car service) supports his suspicion. So, he's not in the wrong for wanting to prevent a potentially risky situation for his fianc\u00e9e. The fianc\u00e9e's insistence on attending despite these red flags is more concerning from a judgment perspective.\n"
