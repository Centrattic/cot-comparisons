I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 not wanting his partner to go to a dinner with her boss. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 is working at a law firm that's known for being a bit shady, with the boss having a reputation as an ambulance chaser. The author is concerned about the boss's intentions, especially since the dinner invitations seem to be narrowing down to just the fianc\u00e9 and another young female employee. The timeline shows the boss changing his mind about inviting partners, then suddenly offering a car service, which the author sees as a red flag.\n\nThe author's main concerns are about the boss's possible ulterior motives, given the history of the company and the boss's character. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, doesn't see any issues and is upset that the author is trying to control her. The author is frustrated and feels justified in his concerns, while the fianc\u00e9 thinks he's being controlling.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. In relationships, trust is key, but there's also a point where valid concerns about a partner's safety or the appropriateness of a situation come into play. The author isn't just being jealous; he's pointing out specific red flags: the boss's reputation, the changing nature of the dinner invitation, and the car service offer. These could indicate that the boss is trying to create an isolated situation, which is a common tactic in harassment scenarios.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9, however, is dismissive of these concerns. She doesn't see the problem and is even more determined to go after the author expresses his worries. Her reaction suggests she might not be fully aware of the potential risks, or perhaps she's downplaying them. \n\nIn terms of relationship dynamics, it's important to communicate concerns, but the author's approach might be confrontational. He called her a \"controlling asshole,\" which is harsh. However, his underlying concern is about her safety and the ethical implications of the boss's actions. \n\nThe key question is whether the author overstepped by trying to prevent her from going. If the author had a history of controlling behavior, that would be a different story, but based on the information given, his actions are driven by specific, legitimate concerns. The boss's behavior does raise red flags, especially in the context of workplace harassment. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author isn't in the wrong. He's acting on valid concerns for his partner's well-being and safety, and while his communication could be smoother, the intent is protective. The fianc\u00e9's boss's actions are questionable, and the author is trying to prevent a potentially dangerous situation. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
