I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9 going to a dinner with her boss, which the author finds suspicious and is causing a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is concerned about the boss's behavior. The timeline shows the boss's invitations keep changing, which is a red flag. The boss is known for shady practices, and the dinner is last-minute with a car service offered. The author is worried about potential inappropriate situations, especially since the boss has a history that makes people distrustful.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 thinks the author is being too controlling. She might feel that her job and her achievements are important, and she might not see the same red flags. Her boss is married, so she might believe he wouldn't do anything to risk his marriage. However, the boss's actions\u2014like the last-minute changes and the car service\u2014could still be problematic.\n\nThe author's main issue is the boss's suspicious behavior and the potential for a compromising situation. He's trying to protect his fianc\u00e9, which is understandable. The fianc\u00e9, however, might feel her autonomy is being questioned. But given the boss's reputation and the way the dinner was arranged, the author's concerns are valid. The fianc\u00e9 not recognizing the red flags might indicate she's not seeing the potential risks, which could put her in a vulnerable position.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't being controlling without cause. The boss's actions are questionable, and the author is voicing legitimate concerns. The fianc\u00e9 dismissing those concerns as controlling might be overlooking the real issues. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. He's trying to prevent a situation that could lead to problems, both for his fianc\u00e9 and their relationship.\n"
