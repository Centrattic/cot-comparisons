I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is engaged to his fianc\u00e9, and there's a conflict about her attending a dinner with her boss. The fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm that's known for being shady, specifically in DUI cases. The boss is described as an ambulance chaser, which probably means he's not reputable. The timeline shows that the dinner plans changed multiple times, and eventually, it turned out that only two young female employees, including the author's fianc\u00e9, were invited. The boss offered a car service to her, and that's when the author freaked out.\n\nThe author is worried that the situation is inappropriate. He feels the setup is fishy because the boss is a married man, the dinner is last-minute, and the boss is offering a car. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't see the problem, calling him controlling. The author is conflicted because he's trying to protect his fianc\u00e9 but she's upset.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. From the author's perspective, he's concerned about his fianc\u00e9's safety and potential impropriety. The boss's actions seem to be creating a private setting with just two young female employees, which could be a red flag. The fact that the boss is making last-minute changes and insisting on a car service instead of allowing the fianc\u00e9 to bring her own partner might be an attempt to create a situation where he's alone with her. The author has reasons to be suspicious given the boss's reputation.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 thinks the author is overreacting. She might not see any wrongdoing and believes her boss is just celebrating their success. However, the situation does have elements that could be considered predatory. The boss is in a position of power over the employees, and inviting only young female employees for a dinner, then arranging a car service, could be an attempt to isolate them.\n\nThe author is expressing concern about his fianc\u00e9's professional environment and potential risks. His reaction is based on the information he's gathered over time. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to acknowledge the red flags might be a bigger issue here. But the author's intentions are to protect his partner, which is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, the author is also in a committed relationship, so he has a right to be involved in major decisions, especially if they could affect their relationship. The problem might be his communication style\u2014accusing her of being an \"asshole\" or \"controlling\" could be hurtful. But his core concern seems valid given the context.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for having concerns. The situation is shady, and his reaction is a response to protect his fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9's dismissal of his concerns without addressing the real issues might be more problematic. The key here is whether the author's actions were unjustified. Since the scenario he presents is questionable, he's not in the wrong for being cautious.\n"
