I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to attend a dinner with her boss. The situation involves a series of events where the fianc\u00e9's boss seems to be creating a scenario that looks a bit suspicious. The author is concerned about the boss's intentions, especially after the timeline reveals that only young female employees are invited, and the boss insists on providing a car service.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They're worried about their fianc\u00e9 being in a potentially uncomfortable or inappropriate situation. The boss's behavior\u2014like changing the event details and arranging a car service\u2014raises red flags. The author's reaction is based on trying to protect their partner, which is a common concern in relationships. However, the fianc\u00e9 feels that her autonomy is being undermined, calling the author controlling. \n\nNow, from the fianc\u00e9's side, she might feel that her partner is overreacting and not trusting her. She's been invited to a work event, which is a professional setting, and she might see it as a normal part of her job. The fact that she's a recent graduate and the company is in a questionable industry could add complexity, but she might not see it as a red flag. \n\nThe key here is about boundaries and communication. The author's concern is valid because they're trying to protect their partner from potential harassment or inappropriate situations. However, the way they've approached the situation\u2014by insisting she can't go\u2014might be controlling. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and the author needs to balance their protective instincts with respecting their fianc\u00e9's autonomy. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's boss's behavior does seem off, especially with the last-minute car service. But the author's decision to prevent her from attending without discussing it together could be seen as overstepping. It's possible the author is right to be cautious, but the method of handling it is problematic. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect and open dialogue rather than unilateral decisions.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for being concerned, but their approach could be better. However, the fianc\u00e9's reaction is also valid if she feels controlled. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions cross into controlling behavior despite valid concerns. Given the information, the author's intentions are protective, but the execution might be the issue. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) but with caveats. However, some might argue the author is in the wrong for not trusting their partner's judgment. Hmm.\n"
