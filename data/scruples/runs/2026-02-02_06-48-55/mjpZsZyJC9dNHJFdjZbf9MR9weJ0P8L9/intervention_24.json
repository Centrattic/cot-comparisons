I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting his fianc\u00e9e to go to dinner with her boss. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e works at a law firm owned by a guy with a shady reputation. The boss is known for being an ambulance chaser. The fianc\u00e9e was invited to a dinner with her boss, but the details keep changing. The author is getting suspicious because the invitees are young, female, and the boss is arranging a car service last minute. The fianc\u00e9e thinks the author is being controlling, while the author is worried about potential impropriety.\n\nThe key points here are the timeline of the invitations changing, the selective invitation of young female employees, and the boss's insistence on a car service. The author is concerned about the boss's intentions, given his reputation. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, doesn't see the issue and wants to go, even after the author lays out his concerns.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Being protective in a relationship is common, but does it cross into controlling behavior? The author has valid concerns based on the boss's reputation and the suspicious circumstances of the dinner. The fianc\u00e9e's boss has a history of unethical behavior, which adds weight to the author's worries. The fact that the boss is arranging a car service at the last minute could be seen as trying to isolate the employees, which is a red flag.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might come off as controlling. He's not giving his fianc\u00e9e the benefit of the doubt and is making a big deal about it. The fianc\u00e9e feels her autonomy is being questioned. But given the boss's track record and the unusual circumstances, the author's concerns aren't entirely unfounded. It's a balance between trust and valid concerns.\n\nIn some cases, a partner might overreact if they don't see the red flags. The fianc\u00e9e might not realize the implications of her boss's behavior. The author is trying to protect their relationship by addressing these issues, even if his method is harsh.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, he's acting out of concern for his fianc\u00e9e's safety and their future. On the other hand, he's being confrontational and possibly controlling. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction is also extreme, locking herself in the room. But considering the boss's reputation and the suspicious dinner setup, the author's concerns are justified. Therefore, maybe he's not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any other angle I'm missing. Maybe the author should have communicated differently or given her more space to decide, but the situation itself has legitimate issues. So, probably answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
