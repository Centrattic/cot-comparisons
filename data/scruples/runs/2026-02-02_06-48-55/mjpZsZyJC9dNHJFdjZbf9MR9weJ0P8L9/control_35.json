I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to go to dinner with her boss. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author is really concerned about the boss's intentions. The boss is described as someone with a shady reputation, and the dinner seems to be set up in a way that makes the author suspicious. The timeline provided shows that the fianc\u00e9 initially said SOs were invited, then changed her mind, and later the invite was only for young female employees. Then the boss insists on sending a car service, which adds to the red flags.\n\nThe author feels like this situation is potentially dangerous or inappropriate. He's trying to protect his fianc\u00e9, which seems like a reasonable concern. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is frustrated that her partner doesn't trust her and is calling him controlling. She might feel that he's overreacting, especially since the boss is married and she might believe he wouldn't act unethically.\n\nBut considering the boss's reputation and the way the dinner was arranged\u2014last-minute changes, only young women invited, offering a car service\u2014it's understandable why the author is worried. The fianc\u00e9 not recognizing these signs could indicate she's either in denial or not seeing the potential issues. The author is trying to communicate his concerns using the evidence he's gathered, which is a valid approach. \n\nThe key points here are the boss's questionable background and the suspicious setup of the dinner. The author's actions are driven by protective instincts rather than controlling behavior, especially since he's not preventing her from going in a safe manner but is concerned about the specific circumstances. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of labeling him as controlling might be a defense mechanism if she feels her achievements are being undermined or if she's in a situation where she doesn't want to cancel plans.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is safety. The author is raising valid concerns based on the situation's specifics. It's possible that the fianc\u00e9 isn't acknowledging the real risks, which could lead to a bigger problem. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. He's trying to navigate a potentially problematic scenario and is communicating his feelings, even if the communication led to conflict. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
