I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's read through the situation again to understand both sides.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who's upset because their partner wants to go to a dinner with her boss. The timeline shows the boss kept changing the story about the dinner\u2014first saying the SOs could come, then it's just a work party, then narrowing down to specific people. The boss even arranges a car service for her, which the author finds suspicious. The fianc\u00e9 feels this is shady and doesn't want her to go, but the fianc\u00e9 insists and calls the author controlling. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author is concerned about the situation with the boss. The boss is described as a questionable person, and the circumstances around the dinner seem odd. The author's intuition about the potential for a problem might be valid, especially since the boss went out of his way to arrange a car service, which could be a red flag. The fianc\u00e9's boss is also a known ambulance chaser, so there's a history there. The author is trying to protect their partner from a potentially uncomfortable or inappropriate situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is making a big deal about this. The fianc\u00e9 was invited to the dinner, and even though the story kept changing, she was still invited. The author is acting on suspicion without concrete evidence. The fianc\u00e9 is an adult and might feel that her fianc\u00e9 is overstepping by not allowing her to make her own decision, especially since the boss is married and there's no direct evidence of anything inappropriate happening. The author's reaction could be seen as controlling because they're preventing her from attending based on their suspicions rather than facts. \n\nThe key points here are about trust in the relationship. If the fianc\u00e9 is comfortable going and the boss is married (as stated), then maybe the author is being overly cautious. However, the boss's behavior does seem odd, and the pattern of the invitations changing could indicate that the dinner is not what it seems. The author is trying to protect their partner, but they might be doing so without clear evidence, leading to conflict. \n\nSo, the author's intentions are to protect, but their approach could be controlling. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that their autonomy is being undermined. However, the situation does have elements that are suspicious, so the author isn't entirely wrong to be concerned. It's a balance between trust and valid concerns. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then the author is wrong for being controlling. If B, then the author is right to be cautious. Given that there's no concrete evidence of the boss's intentions, the author's suspicion might not be justified, and their reaction could be disproportionate. However, the boss's actions do seem shady, so there's a valid concern. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important. If the author doesn't trust their partner's judgment, that's a problem. But if the partner is being invited to a dinner with a questionable boss under odd circumstances, it's understandable to be concerned. The author might not be in the wrong because they're acting on legitimate concerns, even if they are suspicions. However, the way they're handling it\u2014telling the fianc\u00e9 she can't go\u2014could be controlling. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the author's actions are reasonable. Since there's a pattern of the boss's behavior (ambulance chasing) and the dinner's setup (only young women, last-minute car service), the author's concerns are somewhat valid. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. But if the author is not giving their partner the benefit of the doubt and is making a show of evidence to control the situation, that's where they could be wrong. \n\nGiven the context, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the situation does have red flags, and the author is trying to protect their partner. However, the author's approach could be better handled with discussion rather than ultimatums. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since the author is acting on concerns that have some merit, even if they are suspicions, they might not be entirely in the wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
