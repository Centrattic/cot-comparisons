I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to go to dinner with her boss.\n\nFirst, the situation: The fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm that's known for some shady practices. The boss is a controversial figure. There's a dinner being organized, and the timing and details around it are a bit sketchy. The author is concerned because the boss is offering a car service, and the invite seems to be only for younger female employees. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't see the problem and wants to go anyway. The author is frustrated and considering ending the relationship.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they're worried about the potential for inappropriate situations. The boss is sending a car, which could be a red flag. The fact that the dinner is last-minute and only includes certain employees (young, female) is raising alarms. The author is expressing concern based on these signs, which might indicate a pattern of behavior from the boss that's inappropriate.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 doesn't see the issue. She might be underestimating the risk or not seeing the same red flags. The author's approach is to tell her she can't go, which could come off as controlling. The fianc\u00e9 is upset and feels controlled, which is a common conflict point in relationships.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is the author justified in their concerns? The boss's reputation and the specific circumstances (car service, select employees) do suggest potential issues. The author isn't preventing her from going based on jealousy but because of legitimate red flags. However, the way he's handling it might be overreacting. He's using evidence from her past communications, which could be seen as \"hoarding evidence\" as she accused. The argument is that he's trying to protect her from a potentially dangerous situation.\n\nBut is he overstepping? Trust is important in a relationship. If the fianc\u00e9 is being offered a reward (car service) and the boss is married, maybe she believes she's safe. However, the author's concerns are valid given the context. The problem is whether the author's reaction is proportionate. He's threatening to break up the relationship, which is a significant response. His actions might be seen as controlling if he's not allowing her autonomy unless there's a clear danger.\n\nIn some cases, partners might have different thresholds for risk. The author's approach is to be protective, but if it's to the point of controlling her decisions, that's a problem. However, the situation does have elements that could lead to a problematic scenario, especially with the boss's reputation.\n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong because he's trying to protect his fianc\u00e9 from a potentially risky situation. The boss's behavior (car service, selecting certain employees) is suspicious. However, his method of handling it\u2014insisting she can't go and using her own words against her\u2014might be seen as controlling. The fianc\u00e9's reaction also shows a lack of communication.\n\nSo, the answer is a bit nuanced. The author has valid concerns but may be overreacting in his approach. However, given the red flags, he's not without reason. Therefore, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), but it's a close call. Alternatively, if the controlling behavior is the main issue, then A. But considering the context of the boss's actions, B seems more accurate.\n"
