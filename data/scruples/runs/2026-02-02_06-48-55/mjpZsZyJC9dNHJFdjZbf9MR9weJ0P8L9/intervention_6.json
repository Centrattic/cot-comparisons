I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting his partner to go to a dinner with her boss. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The fianc\u00e9 is engaged for several years, and his partner works at a law firm known for aggressive advertising. The boss is described as shady. The timeline shows the fianc\u00e9 was initially told the dinner was for spouses, then it changed, and eventually, it's just two young female employees. The boss offers a car service, which the fianc\u00e9 finds suspicious. The fianc\u00e9 confronts his partner, who is upset and calls him controlling.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and overreaction. The author is concerned about the boss's intentions, but the partner doesn't see any issue. The author is using the timeline and evidence to argue that something's wrong, but the partner dismisses it. The author's actions led to a confrontation where he's now threatening to break off the relationship if the partner goes.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he's trying to protect the relationship by addressing his concerns. On the other, he might be overstepping by not trusting his partner's judgment, especially since she's in a professional setting and the boss is married. However, the boss's behavior does seem questionable\u2014offering a car service after the partner mentions her fianc\u00e9 knowing the restaurant. That could be a red flag.\n\nBut the author's approach might be too confrontational. Instead of discussing his concerns calmly, he's accused the partner of being in on a shady situation and now is threatening to end the engagement. The partner might feel his lack of trust is more harmful than the actual situation. Also, the partner's insistence on going despite the author's concerns could indicate that she doesn't see the issue, which might mean the author is projecting his own fears.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about perspective. If the author's actions are based on unfounded suspicions and he's being controlling, then he's in the wrong. But if there are legitimate red flags and he's trying to prevent a potential problem, he might not be. The balance here is tricky. The author's evidence (changing details, targeting young female employees, suspicious car service) does point to possible inappropriate intentions by the boss. However, the way he's handling it\u2014accusing his fianc\u00e9 of being okay with it and refusing to let her go\u2014might be where he's wrong. Trust is essential in a relationship, and his reaction could be seen as overbearing.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong for not trusting his partner and the way he's handling the situation, even if there are red flags. The partner's refusal to acknowledge the potential issues could be her own fault, but the author's approach is problematic.\n"
