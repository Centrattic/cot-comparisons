I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting his fianc\u00e9 to go to a dinner with her boss. The author is frustrated and even considering breaking off the relationship. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the timeline shows that the fianc\u00e9 kept changing the details of the dinner. Initially, it was supposed to be a staff event with spouses, then it became a work party where the fianc\u00e9 could make other plans, then it narrowed down to only certain people. The author notices that all the invitees are young, female, and under 30. Then the boss offers a car service, which seems a bit odd. The fianc\u00e9 dismisses the author's concerns, calling him controlling. The author feels the situation is shady and wants her to cancel, but she insists on going.\n\nNow, is the author wrong for not wanting her to go? Well, in a relationship, trust and communication are key. The author has valid concerns given the boss's reputation and the suspicious circumstances around the dinner. The boss's quick response and insistence on the car service could be a red flag. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is being selected for this dinner with other young female employees might raise eyebrows. The author is expressing his concerns based on the evidence, which he presented through their communication history. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that her partner is being overprotective or distrustful. However, given the context\u2014working for a boss with a shady reputation, the last-minute changes, and the specific selection of attendees\u2014it's reasonable for the author to be worried. The fianc\u00e9's reaction, calling him controlling, might be a deflection from the real issue. The author isn't forbidding her from going out of jealousy but because of genuine safety concerns. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for voicing his concerns. It's a matter of judgment about the situation. The fianc\u00e9's boss's behavior is questionable, and the author is trying to protect her. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on attending despite the red flags shows she might not take the risks seriously. So, the author's actions stem from concern for her safety, which is a legitimate reason. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
