I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting his fianc\u00e9 to go to dinner with her boss.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm that's known for being a bit shady. The boss is a controversial figure. The fianc\u00e9 was initially told her SO would be invited to a dinner on January 20th. Then she changes the details multiple times, downplaying the event. The author notices that the invitees are all young, female, and only two people, including his fianc\u00e9. The boss offers a car service, which the fianc\u00e9 dismisses as no problem, but the author finds it suspicious. The fianc\u00e9 insists on going, calls the author controlling, and locks herself in the room.\n\nSo, the author is upset because he feels the situation is unethical or possibly a harassment setup. He's trying to protect his fianc\u00e9 and their relationship. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, thinks he's being overbearing and controlling.\n\nNow, the key points here: the author is acting out of concern for his partner's safety and the potential for inappropriate situations. The boss's behavior\u2014like offering a car service last minute\u2014raises red flags. The fianc\u00e9's inconsistent communication about the event's nature is also a problem. The author is trying to prevent a scenario that could lead to issues, especially if the boss is known for shady practices.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, he's not preventing her from going permanently; he's expressing his concerns based on the timeline and inconsistencies. He's not physically stopping her, just refusing to take her. The fianc\u00e9, however, is choosing to go despite his concerns, which could strain their relationship.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is safety. If the author's concerns are valid (and the boss's behavior is questionable), then his reaction is understandable. However, if the fianc\u00e9 feels her autonomy is being threatened, that's also a valid concern. The line between protectiveness and control can be thin here.\n\nBut given the context\u2014multiple changes in the event details, the boss's history, the car service as a possible non-optional arrangement\u2014it seems the author has legitimate reasons to be suspicious. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on going despite these red flags might make her the one at fault. However, the author's approach could come off as controlling if he's not allowing her to make her own decisions, especially if there's no concrete evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nBut considering the boss's reputation and the circumstances, the author's vigilance is justified. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems dismissive of his valid concerns. In such cases, the author is not necessarily in the wrong, especially if the situation could lead to harassment or exploitation. The AITA here might lean towards the fianc\u00e9 for not taking the concerns seriously and for going against her partner's wishes without addressing the underlying issues.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
