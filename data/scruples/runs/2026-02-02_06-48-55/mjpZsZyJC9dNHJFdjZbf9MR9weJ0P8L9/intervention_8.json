I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 being upset that their fianc\u00e9e is going to dinner with her boss, and there's a lot of red flags involved.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 is really frustrated because the timeline from the fianc\u00e9e kept changing. Starting with saying the SOs are invited, then it's not, then the details about who's going\u2014only young women. The boss offering a car service seems suspicious, and the fianc\u00e9e doesn't see the problem. The fianc\u00e9 is worried about the situation being inappropriate and is trying to stop her, leading to an argument where the fianc\u00e9e calls them controlling.\n\nThe user thinks the author (fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The fianc\u00e9's concerns are valid because the situation does seem shady. The boss is known for unethical behavior, the dinner is only with certain employees, and the car service offer seems like it's to prevent the fianc\u00e9e from bringing a partner. The fianc\u00e9e dismissing these concerns and calling the fianc\u00e9 a controlling asshole might be a problem. However, the fianc\u00e9 is expressing valid concerns based on the timeline and the boss's behavior. \n\nBut maybe the fianc\u00e9 overreacted? The fianc\u00e9e is an adult and might feel her autonomy is being questioned. The key is whether the fianc\u00e9 has a legitimate reason to be concerned. The boss's actions and the pattern of exclusivity do raise red flags. The fianc\u00e9 isn't just being paranoid; they're pointing out inconsistencies and potential issues. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be defensive, but that doesn't mean the fianc\u00e9 is wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might have handled it differently. Instead of outright refusing to let her go, maybe discussing the concerns and setting boundaries together could have been better. But given the situation, their reaction is understandable. The question is whether the fianc\u00e9 is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the concerns are legitimate. Since the boss's behavior is questionable and the fianc\u00e9e is being selective about the information, the author's concerns are valid. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being concerned and trying to protect their partner from a potentially problematic situation.\n"
