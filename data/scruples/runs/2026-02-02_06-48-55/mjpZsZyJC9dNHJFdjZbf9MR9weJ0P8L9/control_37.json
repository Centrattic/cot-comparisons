I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9e to go to dinner with her boss. Let me start by reading through the situation again to understand all the details.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e works at a law firm that's known for being a bit shady, especially since the founder is portrayed as an ambulance chaser. The author is really uneasy about this boss, feeling uncomfortable even after meeting him in person. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is invited to a dinner with the boss, but the details keep changing. Initially, it's supposed to be for spouses, then it's just a work party, then it's narrowed down to specific people. The author notices that all the invitees are young, female, and under 30. Then, the boss offers a car service, which makes the author even more suspicious. The fianc\u00e9e, however, insists it's all fine and accuses the author of being controlling.\n\nSo, the author is frustrated and considering breaking off the engagement because of this. The fianc\u00e9e is defensive, saying the author is being unreasonable and controlling. The author is trying to protect their fianc\u00e9e from what they perceive as a risky situation, while the fianc\u00e9e feels her autonomy is being violated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They have valid concerns about the boss's character and the suspicious circumstances surrounding the dinner. The fact that the invitations are only to young, female employees, the sudden change in the reason for the dinner (from the firm's biggest year to being responsible for it), and the boss's insistence on arranging a car service all point to potential issues. The author is trying to address these red flags to protect their fianc\u00e9e, which is a common concern in relationships to avoid potential problems like harassment or inappropriate behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e feels that the author is being controlling. She might believe that she's an adult and capable of making her own decisions, especially in a professional context. The author's approach of gathering all the evidence and confronting her might come off as overbearing, even if their intentions are good. It's possible that the author didn't communicate their concerns effectively, leading to the fianc\u00e9e feeling accused rather than supported.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, trust is crucial. The author's actions are rooted in concern, but they might not be respecting the fianc\u00e9e's autonomy. However, the fianc\u00e9e's dismissal of the concerns as paranoia or controlling behavior could be undermining the author's valid worries. It's a delicate balance between being protective and respecting each other's independence.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic in the workplace. The boss is in a position of authority, and inviting a female employee to a dinner with a car service arranged could be seen as a conflict of interest. The fianc\u00e9e might not see the issue, but the author is right to be cautious. This isn't about controlling behavior but about potential exploitation.\n\nHowever, the author's way of handling it\u2014keeping evidence and confronting the fianc\u00e9e in a way that feels like an ambush\u2014might be contributing to the problem. Instead of a collaborative approach to discuss the risks, it seems like the author is trying to force a decision, which can backfire. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction suggests she feels her freedom is being restricted, which is a legitimate issue in a relationship.\n\nIn summary, while the author has valid concerns about the situation, their method of addressing them might be overstepping, leading to the accusation of being controlling. At the same time, the fianc\u00e9e's insistence on attending despite the red flags could be a problem. The key issue is whether the author's actions are reasonable in protecting their partner versus being unnecessarily controlling. Given the circumstances, the author's concerns are justified, but their approach might need adjustment. So, the answer might depend on whether the author's actions are seen as protective or controlling. Given the evidence presented, it's more about protecting against a potentially problematic situation, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
