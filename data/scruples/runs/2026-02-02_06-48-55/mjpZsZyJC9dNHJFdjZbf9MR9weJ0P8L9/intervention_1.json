I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for not wanting his fianc\u00e9e to go to dinner with her boss. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is upset because his fianc\u00e9e is going to a dinner with her boss, and there are a bunch of red flags he's pointing out. The timeline shows that the boss keeps changing the details about the event. Initially, it's supposed to be for the whole staff and spouses, then it's only a work party where the fianc\u00e9 can make other plans, then it's narrowed down to just the people the boss thinks contributed to the company's success. Then, the people invited are all under 30 and female. The list narrows down to his fianc\u00e9e and another young attorney. The boss offers a car service, which seems a bit suspicious because maybe it's to avoid any awkward situations if they were alone together. The fianc\u00e9 is worried that this dinner could lead to something inappropriate, given the boss's reputation and the way the event was set up. His fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, doesn't see the issue and is calling him controlling.\n\nSo, the key points here are the red flags the fianc\u00e9 is noticing. The boss's company has a shady reputation, there's a history of changing the event details, the invitees are young women, and the boss is providing a car service. The fianc\u00e9 is concerned about potential misconduct, especially since the boss is known for questionable behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the fianc\u00e9 is expressing concern for his partner's safety and well-being, which is natural in a relationship. He's pointing out the suspicious elements and trying to protect her. On the other hand, he's refusing to let her go, which could be seen as controlling or not trusting her. The fianc\u00e9e feels that his actions are controlling, and she's asserting her independence.\n\nI need to weigh the fianc\u00e9's concerns against the control issue. The fact that the boss has a known reputation as a scammer and ambulance chaser (as described in the scenario) adds weight to the concerns. The way the event was arranged\u2014changing plans, selecting specific people, providing a car\u2014could be seen as creating a situation where inappropriate behavior is more likely. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is based on these observations, which might be valid. However, his insistence that she can't go might overstep, especially if the fianc\u00e9e feels that her autonomy is being violated.\n\nBut in a relationship, partners are allowed to have concerns and discuss them. The problem arises when one partner dismisses the other's feelings. In this case, the fianc\u00e9 is trying to communicate his concerns, and the fianc\u00e9e is reacting negatively. However, the fianc\u00e9's approach of not letting her go at all might not be the best solution. Instead, discussing boundaries, like maybe going to the dinner together or having someone else present, could be a better approach.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's response that the boss is married and can't act on any impulses might be a valid point, but the fianc\u00e9's concern is about the situation's potential risk. The boss's past reputation and the way the dinner is set up could still pose a risk, regardless of the boss's marital status.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the fianc\u00e9 isn't necessarily in the wrong for having concerns, but his method of handling it\u2014refusing to let her go without discussion\u2014might be overbearing. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure, I need to decide if the fianc\u00e9's concerns are valid enough to justify his actions, or if he's being too controlling.\n\nIn many relationships, it's important to respect each other's autonomy. The fianc\u00e9's approach could be seen as controlling, especially if he's making the decision for her. However, his concerns are based on real red flags. The line between being protective and being controlling is thin here. The fact that the boss has a problematic history might support the fianc\u00e9's concerns. But the way he's handling it\u2014by not allowing her to go at all\u2014might not be the right approach. A better approach would be to discuss the situation and find a compromise, like attending the dinner together or ensuring transparency.\n\nGiven that the fianc\u00e9 is trying to protect her from a potentially unsafe situation, but is doing so in a way that could be seen as controlling, the answer might depend on cultural or personal relationship norms. However, in general, the fianc\u00e9e has the right to make her own decisions, even if it's risky. The fianc\u00e9's role should be to communicate his concerns and support her decision, rather than dictate it.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his fianc\u00e9e's autonomy, even if his concerns are valid. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
