I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to go to a dinner with her boss. The situation seems pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 is working at a law firm that's known for questionable practices. The boss there is described as an ambulance chaser, which isn't great. The fianc\u00e9's partner initially thought the dinner was a company event for all, but then it got narrowed down. The key points here are the timeline and the details about the attendees. The boss sends a car, which raises red flags when the fianc\u00e9 questions it. The fianc\u00e9's partner then gets upset and calls them controlling.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants to confirm. The question is whether the author (fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong. \n\nSo, the arguments for the author being in the right: The boss's past behavior is shady, the dinner is last-minute and only certain people are invited, the car service adds to the suspicion. The fianc\u00e9 is concerned about possible inappropriate situations and is trying to protect their partner, which is a common concern in relationships. The fianc\u00e9 presented a timeline of events that show the dinner's setup as suspicious. The partner's own acknowledgment that the boss can't do anything to affect his marriage (implying he might be married) might indicate some understanding of the situation's potential issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is being accused of controlling behavior. The partner wants to attend the dinner, and the fianc\u00e9 is forcing their will onto them. The fianc\u00e9 might be overreacting based on assumptions. Maybe the dinner is just a legitimate celebration, and the fianc\u00e9's distrust is unfounded. The partner's frustration is understandable if they feel their autonomy is being challenged.\n\nBut considering the context, the boss's shady reputation, the suspicious setup of the dinner (select few, all young women), and the immediate offer of a car service when the fianc\u00e9 questions it, there's a reasonable basis for concern. The fianc\u00e9 isn't just being paranoid; they have specific reasons to be worried. The partner's own statement about the boss's marriage implies she's aware of the potential issues but still wants to go, which complicates things.\n\nIn relationships, trust is key, but so is safety. If there are legitimate red flags, it's reasonable for one partner to express concern. However, the fianc\u00e9's approach might be too controlling. The partner's reaction is also valid because they feel their autonomy is being taken away. The key here is whether the author's concerns are justified by the facts presented. Since the situation is suspicious and the partner is in a position that could be risky, the author's concerns are valid. But the way they handled it\u2014refusing to let the partner go without discussion\u2014could be seen as overstepping. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the concerns are valid, then they're not in the wrong for expressing them. However, controlling behavior is when you prevent someone from making their own choices without good cause. Here, the cause seems to be based on real issues. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong; they have valid reasons. The partner's choice to go despite the concerns is their decision, but the author's role is to express their concerns, not to force a decision. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
