I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is upset because his fianc\u00e9e is going to a dinner with her boss. The boss is described as someone with a shady reputation, part of a law firm that does DUI charges and is known as an ambulance chaser. The fianc\u00e9 is really frustrated because the setup of the dinner seems suspicious. The timeline shows that the boss initially invited the fianc\u00e9e's significant other, then changed his mind, then the invite got more exclusive, ending up with just the fianc\u00e9e and another young female employee. The boss even arranges a car service, which the fianc\u00e9 finds really odd.\n\nThe author, the fianc\u00e9, is arguing that this whole situation is shady and he's trying to protect his fianc\u00e9e from potential harassment or something. He's even gone as far as telling her not to go, leading to a big argument where she calls him controlling. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The fianc\u00e9's concerns are based on the boss's reputation and the strange circumstances of the dinner. The boss is known for unethical behavior, and the setup of the dinner\u2014changing who's invited, providing a car service\u2014raises red flags. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, doesn't see the issue and is defensive, arguing that the boss is married and can't do anything. But the fianc\u00e9 is worried about the potential for inappropriate behavior.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author tried to communicate his concerns using the timeline and evidence. However, he ended up forbidding her from going, which can be seen as controlling. In a healthy relationship, both partners should have autonomy, and making decisions for each other without mutual agreement can be problematic. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of protecting each other from potential harm. If the situation is genuinely dangerous or inappropriate, the fianc\u00e9's concerns are valid. However, the way he's handling it\u2014declaring he can't let her go and causing a major argument\u2014might be overstepping. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction suggests she feels her autonomy is being threatened, which is a legitimate issue in itself.\n\nSo, the balance here is between the fianc\u00e9's legitimate concerns about her safety and the method he used to address it. If he had communicated his worries and discussed options (like him going with her or attending the dinner), that might be more constructive. Instead, he's taking a more authoritarian approach, which could be seen as controlling, especially if the fianc\u00e9e feels her employer's actions are not inherently threatening.\n\nOn the other hand, given the boss's reputation and the suspicious setup, the fianc\u00e9's caution is understandable. The key point is whether his response was justified. If he's acting out of genuine concern for her safety, that's one thing. But if he's being overbearing without sufficient evidence, that's another. The situation is a bit of a toss-up, but since the author is the one who is more aware of the potential issues and is taking action, even if his method is flawed, it's hard to say he's in the wrong entirely. However, the way he's handling the situation\u2014trying to prevent her from going without mutual discussion\u2014does come off as controlling. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because while his concerns are valid, his response is controlling and not allowing his fianc\u00e9e to make her own decisions, which isn't healthy in a relationship. But I'm a bit conflicted because the situation does have elements that are concerning. Still, the main focus here is on the relationship dynamics and autonomy.\n"
