I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the fianc\u00e9 is upset because his fianc\u00e9e is going to a dinner with her boss, and he's really against it. The fianc\u00e9e works at a law firm that's known for being shady, and the boss is a bit of a controversial figure. The author is frustrated because the fianc\u00e9e kept changing the details about the dinner, and now it's clear that it's a dinner just for her and another young female employee, with the boss sending a car service.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is worried about the situation because the boss is known to be a bit of a scoundrel, and the setup seems to be a bit suspicious. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, doesn't see any issue and is getting upset that the author is trying to control her. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the situation is shady, with the boss providing a car service after being told the fianc\u00e9e's partner knows the restaurant. That seems like a red flag. The fianc\u00e9e is in a position where she's being singled out, maybe for inappropriate reasons. The author is trying to protect their relationship by not letting her go, but the fianc\u00e9e feels it's an invasion of her privacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e is an adult and has the right to accept social invitations, especially from her boss if it's part of her job. However, the situation does seem a bit off. The boss's quick response and the way the event was set up might indicate something inappropriate. The author is acting out of concern for his fianc\u00e9e's safety and the potential risks involved, given the boss's reputation.\n\nBut where's the line drawn here? If the author is overstepping by not allowing her to go without her consent, that's a problem. However, the fianc\u00e9e isn't considering the potential risks, and the author has valid reasons to be concerned. It's a tough balance between respecting her autonomy and protecting her from a possibly dangerous situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's being controlling and not trusting her judgment, then maybe. But if the situation is genuinely risky, his concerns are valid. The key here is whether the author has a reasonable basis for his concerns. The boss's history and the unusual setup of the dinner suggest there's a reason to be cautious. However, the author shouldn't prevent her from going without a discussion and mutual agreement. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be overreacting, but his concerns aren't baseless. The fianc\u00e9e should be aware of the risks, but the author shouldn't unilaterally decide for her. They need to communicate and find a middle ground. But whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his actions are controlling or protective. Since he's using evidence and trying to protect her, maybe he's not entirely wrong, but his approach could be better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is A for yes, then maybe because he's being controlling. Or B for no because he's protecting her. Hmm.\n"
