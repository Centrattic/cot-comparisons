I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA) for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to go to dinner with her boss. So, the main issue here is about trust and possible jealousy.\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm with a boss who has a bad reputation. The boss is known for being a bit of a shady character, and he's inviting the fianc\u00e9 and another young female employee to a dinner, which is supposed to be a celebration. The timeline shows that the fianc\u00e9 kept changing the story about who's invited, which might be a red flag. The fianc\u00e9's boss insists on sending a car service, which makes the author suspicious. The author is concerned that there might be inappropriate situations, especially since the boss is married and the fianc\u00e9 is also in a committed relationship.\n\nThe author is worried about the potential for the boss to take advantage of the situation, given his reputation. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, seems to downplay the concerns, calling the author controlling. The author feels they're justified in their concerns because of the boss's history and the way the dinner was set up. The fianc\u00e9 is not picking up on the red flags, which is causing a major conflict.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong, we need to consider if their concerns are reasonable. The boss has a known bad reputation, the dinner is arranged in a way that might isolate the employees (like sending a car service), and the fianc\u00e9 is being selected from a list that seems to exclude others. These factors can be legitimate reasons for concern. The author is trying to protect their partner from a potentially risky situation, which is a valid action in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is preventing the fianc\u00e9 from attending a work function. However, the fianc\u00e9's boss is the one arranging the dinner, and the author's concerns are based on credible information about the boss's character. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on going despite the red flags might indicate that she doesn't recognize the risks, which could be a problem in itself.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for partners to communicate concerns about safety and well-being. The author is expressing legitimate fears based on the situation. The fianc\u00e9's reaction of calling the author controlling might be a defense mechanism if she's aware that there could be something inappropriate. However, the author's actions aren't just about jealousy; they're about preventing a potentially dangerous situation. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid reasons to be concerned given the boss's background and the way the dinner is set up. The fianc\u00e9 should be considering these concerns instead of dismissing them. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
