I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong regarding their fianc\u00e9 going to dinner with her boss. The writer is really frustrated and considering breaking off the relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9 is in a high-profile law firm known for aggressive marketing, and the boss is described as a shady character. The writer is concerned because the boss has been inviting the fianc\u00e9 to various dinners, with the final plan being a dinner where he sends a car service. The fianc\u00e9 insists on going, and the writer feels it's inappropriate.\n\nThe writer's main arguments are the timeline of the invitations, the selection of attendees (all young women), and the boss's insistence on providing a car service, which the writer interprets as a red flag. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, dismisses these concerns, says the writer is controlling, and wants to go anyway. The writer is worried about potential impropriety, possibly even harassment.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The fianc\u00e9 is in a professional role and might need to attend work events. However, the boss's behavior\u2014especially the last-minute change to a car service\u2014could be a way to isolate her. The writer is acting out of concern for his fianc\u00e9's safety and to protect their future marriage. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that her partner is being overly controlling and not trusting her. The writer is using evidence from the timeline to support his concerns, which is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9 not recognizing the same concerns could indicate a lack of communication or differing priorities.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The writer is trying to express valid concerns based on observed patterns. While it's important for the fianc\u00e9 to have her own autonomy, the writer's actions stem from a place of wanting to avoid potential issues. However, the writer's approach may come off as controlling if not handled with more open dialogue. \n\nThe question is whether the writer is wrong for not wanting her to go. The situation has enough red flags that the writer's concern is understandable. However, forcing the decision without mutual understanding could be seen as overstepping. \n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. The writer has valid concerns but the way they handled it might contribute to the conflict. However, the fianc\u00e9's insistence without acknowledging the risks also plays a role. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and considering the context, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the concerns are justified, even if the approach could be improved.\n"
