I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to go to dinner with her boss. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm known for shady practices. The boss is a controversial figure, and the dinner setup seems odd. Over time, the fianc\u00e9's communication about the dinner changes\u2014initially saying the SO is invited, then it's a work party, and then it's clear it's just for selected employees. The big red flag is that all attendees are young, female, and the boss insists on sending a car service when told the fianc\u00e9's partner knows the restaurant. \n\nThe author is worried about the situation being inappropriate, maybe even predatory. The fianc\u00e9, however, doesn't see the issue and calls the author controlling. She even mentions the boss is married and can't do anything, implying she sees the risk but still wants to go. The author is frustrated and considers breaking off the engagement.\n\nNow, considering trust in a relationship, the author has valid concerns based on the timeline and the boss's behavior. The fianc\u00e9 isn't acknowledging the red flags, which the author has documented. The author isn't trying to control her but is protecting her from a potentially dangerous situation. The fianc\u00e9's reaction (locking herself in the room) suggests she's defensive and not engaging constructively. \n\nIt's a judgment call. The author isn't being paranoid; the scenario has clear warning signs. The fianc\u00e9's dismissive attitude might indicate she's in denial. So, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing concerns. Answer B (No).\n"
