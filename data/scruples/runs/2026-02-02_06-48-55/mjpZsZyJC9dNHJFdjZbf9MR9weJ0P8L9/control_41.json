I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the fianc\u00e9 not wanting her to go to a dinner with her boss. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm that's known for being a bit shady, with the boss having a bad reputation. The author is concerned because the boss is sending a car service to pick up the fianc\u00e9 and another young female employee for a dinner. The timeline shows that the event was initially supposed to include spouses, then changed to a work party, then narrowed down to specific people. The author is worried about the potential for inappropriate behavior, especially since the boss is known for being unscrupulous.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the situation is suspicious. The boss's last-minute change to send a car service instead of letting the fianc\u00e9 drive herself raises red flags. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, doesn't see the issue and is upset that her partner is being controlling. She argues that the boss is married and can't do anything to affect his marriage, implying that the author is overreacting.\n\nNow, considering the points: The author is expressing concern about his fianc\u00e9's safety and the ethical implications of the situation. The boss's behavior\u2014suddenly providing a car service when asked to change transportation\u2014could be seen as an attempt to isolate the employees, which is a red flag. The author isn't trying to control her in a general sense but is reacting to specific concerning circumstances. The fianc\u00e9's dismissal of these concerns and insistence on attending despite the risks might suggest she's not taking the situation seriously enough.\n\nIs the author being controlling? Well, he's not preventing her from working or other aspects of her life, just this specific event which he finds problematic. His concerns are based on the boss's history and the unusual circumstances of the dinner. On the other hand, he should communicate his feelings without being overly domineering. However, given the context, his worries aren't unfounded. The fianc\u00e9's reaction\u2014calling him a controlling asshole and locking herself in\u2014shows tension, but the core issue is about potential harassment or unsafe situations.\n\nIn relationships, trust is key, but so is addressing legitimate concerns. The author isn't preventing her from going out in general; it's a specific instance where the situation is questionable. The boss's actions (changing transportation last minute) are suspicious. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being concerned. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to see the problem and her defensiveness might be the bigger issue here.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. His concerns are valid given the circumstances, and he's trying to protect his fianc\u00e9 from a potentially risky situation. The fianc\u00e9's dismissive attitude and the boss's odd behavior support the author's stance.\n"
