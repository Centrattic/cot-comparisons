I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author (the person asking the question) is in the wrong in their situation with their fianc\u00e9. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm that's known for being a bit sketchy. The boss, who is also married, is taking selected employees, mostly young women, to a dinner. The author is really upset about this and wants their fianc\u00e9 to not go. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, doesn't see the problem and is pushing to go, even calling the author controlling.\n\nThe author provided a timeline where the fianc\u00e9 kept changing the details about the dinner, which the author found suspicious. The boss sends a car service, which adds to the author's suspicion. The fianc\u00e9 dismisses the concerns, even after the author presents the timeline. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about the key points here. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're worried about their fianc\u00e9 being in a situation that could be inappropriate, especially with a married boss known for shady practices. The author's actions are based on protecting their fianc\u00e9 and the relationship. They are not forcing the fianc\u00e9 to do anything, just expressing serious concerns. However, the author might come off as overreacting if there's no direct evidence of wrongdoing. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is being controlling. The author is trying to prevent her from attending an event she was invited to, which could be seen as an overreach. But considering the context\u2014like the boss's reputation and the suspicious circumstances\u2014the author's worry isn't unfounded. \n\nThere's also the dynamic of the relationship. The author is trying to communicate concerns, but the fianc\u00e9 isn't taking them seriously. The argument is about whether the author's concerns are valid or if they're being too controlling. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't forcing the fianc\u00e9 to do anything, but their refusal to let the fianc\u00e9 attend might be seen as controlling if there's no legitimate threat. However, given the boss's background and the way the dinner was arranged, there's reasonable cause for concern. \n\nI think the key here is the balance between being overprotective and being justified in one's concerns. The author has reasons to be suspicious, but they need to communicate in a way that respects their partner's autonomy. However, the fianc\u00e9's dismissal of the concerns and the author's frustration might tip the scales. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're acting from a place of concern, even if their approach could be better. The fianc\u00e9's boss has a questionable reputation, and the circumstances around the dinner are odd, which supports the author's worries. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). But wait, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong. Maybe I need to check again. \n\nWait, the user's own thought was they thought the author was in the wrong. But when analyzing, maybe the author isn't. The problem is whether the author's concerns are valid. If the boss is a known scammer and the event is arranged in a way that's isolating the fianc\u00e9 with a married man, the author's concern is valid. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). So the final answer is B.\n"
