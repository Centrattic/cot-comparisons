I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9 going to a dinner with her boss, and the author is really upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details provided. The author and their fianc\u00e9 have been together for several years. The fianc\u00e9 has a new job in HR at a law firm that's known for being a bit shady, especially the boss who's portrayed in commercials as an ambulance chaser. The author met the boss and felt uncomfortable, like needing a shower afterward, which suggests they don't trust him.\n\nThen there's the timeline of the dinner invitation. The fianc\u00e9 first said SOs are invited, but later she changed it to a work party where he could make other plans. Then came the revelation that it's not the whole office but only selected people, and then it turns out that the two people chosen are both young, female, and recent grads. The boss insists on sending a car service, even when the fianc\u00e9's partner (the author) suggests he drive instead. The fianc\u00e9 dismisses the author's concerns, calling him controlling and an asshole, and even points out that the boss is married and wouldn't risk his marriage. The author is now considering breaking off the engagement because of this.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know what I think. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nSo, to determine who's right, I should consider both perspectives. The author is worried about the boss's intentions, especially given the boss's reputation and the selective nature of the invite. The boss's behavior, like offering a car service even when the fianc\u00e9's partner is available, might be a red flag. The author is trying to protect their fianc\u00e9 and the relationship, but the fianc\u00e9 is upset about being controlled. \n\nBut maybe the author is overstepping? The fianc\u00e9 was invited to the dinner, and the author is trying to dictate her decision. However, the boss's actions do seem suspicious, and the fianc\u00e9 might be in a vulnerable position. The author has reasons to be concerned based on the boss's history and the situation's progression. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's argument is that the boss is married and can't do anything that would affect his marriage. But the author's perspective is that the boss might still be trying to create a situation where he can be alone with her, especially with the car service offer. \n\nIn relationships, it's common for partners to have different boundaries and comfort levels. The author isn't physically or verbally abusive, but is expressing concern. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might feel that the author is being overly controlling without sufficient reason. \n\nHowever, the boss's insistence on the car service even when the author is available could be a sign that he wants to be alone with her. The author might be justified in their concern. The fianc\u00e9 not recognizing the potential issues and dismissing them as controlling might indicate that she's not taking the author's valid concerns seriously. \n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? If the author is making a reasonable concern based on the boss's reputation and the situation's unusual aspects, then maybe not. On the other hand, if the author is being overly controlling without clear evidence of wrongdoing, then they might be in the wrong. \n\nBut the boss has a history of questionable behavior, and the way the invitation was handled (changing details, selecting only young females, insisting on car service) adds up to a potentially inappropriate situation. The author's actions are based on protecting their fianc\u00e9, which is a common reason for concern in such cases. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reactions seem to be more about the control rather than the actual risks. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
