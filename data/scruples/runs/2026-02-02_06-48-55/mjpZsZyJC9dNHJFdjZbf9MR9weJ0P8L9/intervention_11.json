I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The story is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting their partner to go to a dinner with her boss. The author is frustrated and considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm that's known for being a bit sketchy, with the boss having a bad reputation. The boss is inviting the fianc\u00e9 to a dinner, but the setup seems a bit off. The timeline has the fianc\u00e9 changing her story multiple times about the event, and eventually, the boss arranges a car service, which the author sees as a red flag. The fianc\u00e9 is going despite the author's objections, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe author is arguing that the situation is shady, especially since the boss is married and the fianc\u00e9 is being the only one picked, especially when the list narrows down to two young women. The author is worried about potential inappropriate situations. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, thinks the author is being controlling and insists on going, even after the author presents the timeline.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking validation. Let me consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He's concerned about his fianc\u00e9's safety and the potential for impropriety, especially with a boss known for dubious practices. The changing details and the boss's insistence on a car service are reasonable red flags. His reaction is based on those concerns. He's trying to protect his fianc\u00e9 and their future marriage.\n\nFrom the fianc\u00e9's perspective: She might feel her partner is being overly controlling. She could argue that the boss is married and that there's no evidence of wrongdoing. She might also feel that her career achievements are being downplayed, given that she was recognized by the boss. She might also feel that the author isn't trusting her, which could be a bigger issue in their relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author has valid concerns based on the circumstances described. However, his approach might be seen as overstepping if he's not allowing his fianc\u00e9 to make her own decisions, unless there's clear evidence of wrongdoing. The fianc\u00e9 has the right to her own career and decisions, but she might also need to consider the potential risks in a situation that seems suspicious.\n\nThe key points are the boss's reputation, the changing nature of the event, and the special treatment with the car service. The author's concerns are not baseless, but his reaction (threatening to break off the engagement) might be extreme. The fianc\u00e9's response of calling him controlling could also be valid if he's not allowing her autonomy. However, the fianc\u00e9's insistence on going despite the red flags might not be the wisest choice, especially if there's a real risk of impropriety.\n\nIn many cases, communication and mutual understanding are key. The author might not be in the wrong for expressing his concerns, but his approach could be improved. The fianc\u00e9 isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to attend, but she should also be cautious given the circumstances. However, the author's reaction to potentially break up over this might be excessive if there's no concrete evidence, but given the red flags, it's understandable.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong. His concerns are valid, and he's trying to protect their future. The fianc\u00e9's actions might be risky, but she has her own autonomy. The answer likely depends on cultural or personal values regarding trust and autonomy in relationships. But based on the information given, the author's concerns are justified, so he's probably not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
