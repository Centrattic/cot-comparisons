I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The main issue is about the fianc\u00e9 not wanting her to go to a dinner with her boss, leading to a potential breakup. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who feels something's off with the work dinner. The timeline shows that the boss is known for shady practices, and the dinner seems to have been planned with suspicious changes. The author is worried about possible inappropriate situations, especially after the boss insists on a car service despite the fianc\u00e9 being a young female employee. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, doesn't see the problem and accuses the author of being controlling.\n\nThe key points here are trust and communication. The author is acting out of concern for their partner's safety and the potential risks involved, especially given the boss's reputation. The fianc\u00e9, however, feels that her autonomy is being questioned and that the author is overreacting. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If the author is constantly second-guessing their partner's decisions without clear evidence, that could be seen as controlling. But in this case, there are specific red flags: the boss's shady reputation, the last-minute changes to the dinner plans, and the fact that only young female employees are invited. These could legitimately cause concern. \n\nThe author's actions are based on these red flags, and they're trying to protect their partner. However, the way they're handling it might be confrontational. Instead of approaching it with evidence and discussing concerns calmly, they might be coming off as accusatory. The fianc\u00e9's reaction\u2014locking herself in the room and calling the author a controlling asshole\u2014suggests that the communication breakdown is significant. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? They have valid concerns based on the timeline and the boss's behavior. However, overreacting and making ultimatums without giving the fianc\u00e9 a chance to express her side properly could be problematic. The author might be right to be cautious, but the approach is what's causing the conflict. \n\nIn such scenarios, the balance between protecting a partner and respecting their autonomy is delicate. The author's intentions are protective, but the method of expressing those concerns is leading to conflict. The fianc\u00e9 might feel her autonomy is being violated, which is a valid feeling even if the author's concerns are genuine. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having concerns. The issue might lie more in how those concerns are communicated. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the author is being overly controlling without giving the fianc\u00e9 a chance to address the concerns, then maybe they are. The key is whether the author's actions are based on valid concerns or just distrust without evidence. Given the boss's shady background and the suspicious circumstances, the author's concerns are justified, making them not in the wrong.\n"
