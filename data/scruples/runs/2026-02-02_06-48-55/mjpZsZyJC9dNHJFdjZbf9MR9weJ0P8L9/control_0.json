I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 not wanting his wife to go to a dinner with her boss. The key points are the timeline and the red flags that the author is pointing out.\n\nFirst, the author mentions a law firm that's known for being shady, with the boss being an ambulance chaser. The boss is sending a car to pick up the fianc\u00e9 last-minute, which seems odd. The author also notices that the people being invited to dinner are young, female, and recent hires. The boss changes the details multiple times, and when the fianc\u00e9 suggests her partner drive, the boss insists on sending a car. \n\nThe author is concerned about potential inappropriate behavior or even a setup. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, doesn't see the issue and is upset that her partner isn't trusting her. The author feels justified in his concerns because of the suspicious circumstances, while the fianc\u00e9 sees his actions as controlling.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The author is voicing his concerns based on the timeline and the boss's behavior. He's not preventing her from going without cause but is acting on legitimate red flags. The fianc\u00e9, however, seems dismissive of his concerns and is choosing to ignore the potential risks. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is addressing legitimate concerns. If there are clear signs of something inappropriate, it's reasonable to be cautious. The author isn't controlling without reason; he's reacting to specific events that raise alarm. The fianc\u00e9's boss's behavior\u2014changing plans, sending a car last-minute, selecting specific employees\u2014could indicate inappropriate intentions. \n\nThe author isn't stopping her from going for no reason; he's highlighting patterns that suggest something's off. The fianc\u00e9's response of calling him controlling and wanting to go anyway might indicate she's not taking his valid concerns seriously. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's trying to protect the relationship by addressing potential issues, while the fianc\u00e9 is dismissing his legitimate worries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
