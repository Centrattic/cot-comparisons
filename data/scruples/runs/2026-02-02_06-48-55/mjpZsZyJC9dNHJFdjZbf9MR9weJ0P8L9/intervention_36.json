I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who is upset because his fianc\u00e9e wants to go to a dinner with her boss. The boss is described as a shady character\u2014someone known for being an ambulance chaser and scammer. The timeline shows that the dinner keeps changing, first saying spouses are invited, then it's just a work party, then it's only certain people, and then it's just the fianc\u00e9e and another young female attorney. Plus, the boss insists on sending a car service, which seems odd.\n\nThe author is concerned because all the red flags are pointing towards a possible inappropriate situation. He's trying to prevent his fianc\u00e9e from going, but she's calling him controlling. The key points here are the boss's reputation, the changing details of the dinner, the selection of only young female employees, and the last-minute car service offer.\n\nNow, is the author justified in his concerns? Well, from a relationship standpoint, trust is important. The fianc\u00e9e is going to a dinner with a known shady boss, and the circumstances are suspicious. The author is expressing his fears based on the evidence he's observed. However, he's also deciding that she can't go, which could be seen as overstepping if there's no concrete proof of wrongdoing. But considering the context, his concerns are not unreasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that her partner is being overly controlling. However, the boss's behavior\u2014changing the event details, offering a car service\u2014could be attempts to create a situation where they're alone. The fianc\u00e9e might not recognize the signs, thinking it's just a celebration. The author is trying to protect his partner from a potentially dangerous or unethical situation.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's acting out of concern for her safety and the suspicious circumstances, then he's not in the wrong. However, if he's being overly controlling without valid reasons, then maybe. But given the details provided\u2014especially the boss's reputation and the odd changes\u2014the author's actions seem reasonable. The fianc\u00e9e's insistence on going despite the red flags could be her being in the wrong, but the question is about the author. So, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
