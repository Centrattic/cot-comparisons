I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9 going to a dinner with her boss, and the author is upset about it. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is concerned because the boss is known for shady practices, and the dinner setup seems suspicious. The timeline shows the fianc\u00e9 kept changing the details about the dinner, which made the author uneasy. The boss offered a car service, which the author found shady. The fianc\u00e9, however, didn't see the problem and called the author controlling.\n\nNow, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are trust in the relationship and the author's reaction. The author's concerns might stem from valid red flags\u2014like the boss's reputation and the way the dinner was arranged. However, the author is preventing the fianc\u00e9 from attending based on these suspicions without concrete evidence. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, communication and trust are crucial. The author might be overstepping by not allowing the fianc\u00e9 to make her own decision, especially if there's no proof of wrongdoing. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might be dismissive of valid concerns. The author's reaction could be seen as controlling if there's no evidence to support the suspicion. \n\nBut considering the boss's history and the suspicious circumstances, the author's caution isn't entirely unfounded. However, the way the author is handling it\u2014refusing to let the fianc\u00e9 attend without proof\u2014might be crossing a line. The fianc\u00e9's argument that the author is being controlling could be valid if the author isn't giving her the autonomy to decide. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author is acting out of distrust without evidence, then yes. But if the author has legitimate concerns based on the situation, maybe not. But generally, in relationships, unless there's a history of infidelity or clear danger, being overly controlling can be seen as the problem. The fianc\u00e9's boss is married, so maybe the author is projecting. But the author's actions are based on the suspicious setup. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit torn. The author might be overreacting, but the situation has red flags. The answer could depend on cultural or personal relationship norms. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and without evidence of actual wrongdoing from the fianc\u00e9, the author's actions could be seen as controlling. So maybe answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the author's concerns are valid, maybe B (No).\n"
