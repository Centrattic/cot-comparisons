I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for not wanting his fianc\u00e9e to go to dinner with her boss. The situation is detailed in an \"Am I the Asshole\" style post.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The key points are: the fianc\u00e9e is going to a dinner with her boss, which seems to be a reward for their contribution to the company's success. The author is concerned because the boss has sent a car service to pick her up, and the event is only for young female employees. The fianc\u00e9e downplays the author's concerns, calling him controlling. The author is frustrated and considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are trust, communication, and potential red flags. The author is voicing his concerns based on the timeline of events and the suspicious nature of the boss's actions. The fact that the boss is known for unethical behavior adds to the skepticism. The author is trying to protect his fianc\u00e9e from a possibly uncomfortable or dangerous situation.\n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9e feels that her partner is being controlling. The question is whether the author's concerns are valid and if his reaction is proportionate. In a healthy relationship, both partners should communicate their concerns. The author is expressing his worries, which is reasonable. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction (calling him names, refusing to communicate) might indicate that she's not taking his concerns seriously or that there's a communication issue between them.\n\nThe boss's actions\u2014like offering a car service at the last minute\u2014could be a way to create a scenario where the employee is isolated, which might be problematic. The author's frustration is understandable. He's not necessarily being controlling; he's pointing out potential issues that his fianc\u00e9e is ignoring. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that her autonomy is being questioned. But given the boss's reputation and the specific details (young women, last-minute car service), there's a valid reason to be cautious. The author is not forbidding her outright for no reason. He's highlighting the risks involved, which is responsible behavior.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's raising legitimate concerns about a situation that could lead to ethical issues or harassment. The fianc\u00e9e's dismissive attitude is the problem here, not the author's concerns. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
