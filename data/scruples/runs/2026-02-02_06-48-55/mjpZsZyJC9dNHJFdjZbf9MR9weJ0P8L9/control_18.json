I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 who is upset about their partner going to a dinner with her boss. The key points to consider are the red flags mentioned and the fianc\u00e9's reaction.\n\nFirst, the timeline shows that the boss's invitations changed multiple times. Initially, the fianc\u00e9 was told the spouse could come, then it was just a work party, and eventually, it became a dinner for a select group. The fianc\u00e9 notices that the attendees are all young women, which raises concerns about potential impropriety. The boss's insistence on sending a car service, even when the fianc\u00e9's partner suggests he drive instead, is another red flag. This could imply the boss wants to avoid having the fianc\u00e9 there, perhaps to create a situation where they're alone.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 is worried about the implications of the boss's behavior, especially given the boss's reputation as an ambulance chaser and scammer. The fianc\u00e9's concerns are not unfounded, as the situation does present elements that could be problematic. The fianc\u00e9's partner, however, dismisses these concerns, calling the fianc\u00e9 controlling and insisting on going. The fianc\u00e9 is left feeling frustrated and worried about potential issues arising from the dinner.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of their relationship, the fianc\u00e9 is expressing valid concerns based on observed behavior. It's reasonable for them to be apprehensive, given the boss's history and the unusual circumstances of the dinner. The fianc\u00e9 is not preventing their partner from attending for no reason; they have specific reasons to be concerned. However, the way the fianc\u00e9 is handling the situation might be contributing to the conflict. Accusing the partner of being an asshole and possibly being too controlling could be seen as harsh. But the core issue is the legitimate concern about the situation's potential for impropriety.\n\nThe partner's insistence on attending despite the red flags is also a point of contention. If the partner truly had nothing to hide, they might be more open to the fianc\u00e9's concerns and maybe even cancel the dinner to avoid any misunderstandings. The fact that the partner is going despite the fianc\u00e9's worries might indicate a lack of consideration for the fianc\u00e9's feelings or a dismissal of valid concerns.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the line is a bit blurry. The fianc\u00e9 isn't wrong for being concerned and trying to protect their relationship, but their approach might be too confrontational. On the other hand, the partner might be dismissing valid concerns without proper consideration. However, the fianc\u00e9's worries are based on observable facts, so they aren't entirely in the wrong. The partner's reaction could be seen as dismissive and not addressing the underlying issues.\n\nIn conclusion, while both parties have valid points, the fianc\u00e9 is acting on legitimate concerns. The boss's behavior and the dinner setup do present a problematic scenario. The fianc\u00e9 isn't in the wrong for expressing these concerns and trying to prevent a potentially harmful situation. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
