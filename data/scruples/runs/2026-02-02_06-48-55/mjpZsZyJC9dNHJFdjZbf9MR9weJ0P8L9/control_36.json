I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9e to go to dinner with her boss. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who's concerned about their partner going to a dinner with a boss who has a shady reputation. The boss is known for being a scammer, and the circumstances around the dinner are suspicious. The fianc\u00e9e got invited after a confusing timeline where details kept changing, and the invitees turned out to be young, female, and recent graduates. The boss insists on providing a car service, which the author finds questionable.\n\nThe author's main concern is protecting their fianc\u00e9e from a potentially inappropriate situation. They have valid reasons to be worried\u2014given the boss's reputation and the way the invitations were handled, it's reasonable to be cautious. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, thinks her partner is being controlling and overreacting. She doesn't see the same red flags and wants to go to the dinner despite the fianc\u00e9's objections.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about the author's intent and the context. The author is expressing concern for their partner's safety and well-being. They're not just being controlling without reason; there's a legitimate basis for their suspicion. The fianc\u00e9e, however, is dismissing these concerns, which could be a problem if the author is right.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are vital. The author is trying to communicate their concerns using evidence they've gathered. The fianc\u00e9e is reacting defensively, which might indicate that she's not addressing the underlying issues. The author isn't preventing her from going without a valid reason; they have specific reasons tied to the boss's character and the situational red flags.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach could be seen as overstepping. While their concerns are valid, how they're handling it\u2014like forbidding her to go\u2014might be controlling. However, given the context, it's a protective measure. The question is whether the author is wrong for having these concerns or the way they're expressed.\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and whether the actions are justified. Here, the author's intentions are protective, not malicious. The fianc\u00e9e's boss's reputation and the suspicious circumstances support the author's worry. The author isn't acting without cause, so they're not necessarily the asshole.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have valid reasons for their concerns, even if their approach could be improved. The fianc\u00e9e's dismissal of those concerns without addressing the red flags might be the bigger issue here.\n"
