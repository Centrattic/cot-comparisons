I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9e to go to dinner with her boss. The situation involves a lot of red flags, like the boss's shady reputation, the last-minute changes to the event (like the car service), and the fact that only young female employees are invited.\n\nFirst, the author's concerns are understandable. The boss seems to have a questionable history, and the way the dinner invitation is handled is suspicious. The fianc\u00e9e's boss insists on a car service even after being told the author is willing to drive, which is a classic sign of trying to get the employee alone. The author is trying to protect their partner and the relationship, which is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, communication is key in relationships. The author might have overreacted by not discussing this calmly and instead taking a firm stance without giving their fianc\u00e9e a chance to explain her perspective. The fianc\u00e9e might feel that her career and trust are being undermined. The author's accusation of being \"controlling\" could be valid if they're not allowing open dialogue. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's boss's behavior is definitely inappropriate, and the author is right to be cautious. The problem might stem from a lack of mutual understanding. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having concerns, but the way they handled it could have been better. The fianc\u00e9e also has a right to her independence, but she might need to see the potential risks of the situation. \n\nSo, the author's intentions are good, but their approach might have been too harsh. They need to balance their protective instincts with respecting their partner's autonomy. Ultimately, it's about whether their actions were based on genuine concerns versus controlling behavior. Given the context, the author isn't in the wrong because the boss's actions are indeed questionable, and the author is trying to protect the relationship.\n"
