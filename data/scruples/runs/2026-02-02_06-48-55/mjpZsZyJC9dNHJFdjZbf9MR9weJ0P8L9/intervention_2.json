I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 not wanting her to go to dinner with her boss. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm owned by a guy with a shady reputation. The boss is known for being an ambulance chaser, and the author is uncomfortable with that. Then there's this dinner that's supposed to be a celebration for the biggest year ever, but the details change multiple times\u2014first the author is invited, then not, then it's only certain people. The final list is two young female employees. The boss offers a car service, which raises red flags for the author. He's concerned about the situation, calls the fianc\u00e9 out, she calls him controlling. Now they're in a standoff.\n\nSo, the author is frustrated because he feels there's something off about the whole setup. The boss's actions\u2014changing plans, offering a car service\u2014could be seen as trying to create a situation where he's alone with the employees. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't see the problem, which makes the author feel his concerns are dismissed. \n\nOn one hand, the author is acting out of concern for his fianc\u00e9's safety and the potential for inappropriate behavior. He's using the evidence he's gathered to protect her. On the other hand, maybe he's overreacting? If the fianc\u00e9 believes it's okay and the boss is married, does that mean the author is being too controlling? But given the boss's reputation and the suspicious circumstances, his concerns are valid. The fianc\u00e9's response that the boss can't do anything because he's married shows she does see the implications but is still going to the dinner. \n\nThe key points are the boss's history, the changing details of the dinner, the age and gender of the invitees, and the last-minute car service offer. All these factors contribute to a situation that smells fishy. The author is trying to protect his partner, which is a reasonable reaction in the face of potential misconduct. However, the way he's handling it\u2014calling her a controlling asshole and refusing to let her go\u2014might be confrontational. But given the context, his actions are driven by legitimate concerns. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. The boss's behavior is questionable, and the author is acting in his fianc\u00e9's best interest. The fianc\u00e9 dismissing his concerns without addressing the actual red flags is the problem. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
