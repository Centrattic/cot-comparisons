I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting the other to go to a dinner with her boss. There are several points to consider.\n\nFirst, the timeline the author provided seems to show inconsistencies in the fianc\u00e9's communication about the dinner. The fianc\u00e9 initially said the author's significant other (SO) was invited, then changed it to just a work party, then mentioned it's only for select people. The author noticed that all attendees are young females under 30, which raises red flags. The boss sending a car service after the author suggests an alternative makes it seem like the boss might be trying to get the fianc\u00e9 alone. \n\nThe author's concerns might be valid given the boss's reputation as a shady character. The fianc\u00e9 downplays these concerns, calling the author controlling. But the author is trying to protect their relationship from potential issues, like inappropriate behavior from the boss. The fianc\u00e9's own comment about the boss not being able to do anything that affects his marriage suggests she also sees some risk, but she's choosing to ignore it. \n\nThe author isn't preventing her from going entirely but is voicing serious concerns based on the situation's progression. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems defensive and dismissive. In relationships, trust and communication are key. If there are legitimate reasons to be concerned about the boss's intentions, the author has a right to be worried. However, the author might need to approach this calmly rather than being confrontational. But given the context, the concerns aren't unfounded. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
