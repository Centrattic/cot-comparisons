I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is a fianc\u00e9 who's really upset because his fianc\u00e9 wants to go to dinner with her boss. The boss is the owner of a law firm that has a reputation for being a bit sketchy\u2014like ambulance chasers. The fianc\u00e9 feels like the situation is shady, especially because the boss keeps changing the story about the dinner and sending a car service. The fianc\u00e9 is worried that this might lead to something inappropriate, and he's trying to stop her. The fianc\u00e9's partner is calling him controlling, and they're having a big fight about it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to see if that's accurate.\n\nFirst, let's look at the fianc\u00e9's perspective. He's concerned about her safety and the potential for any inappropriate situations. The boss is sending a car, and the fianc\u00e9 is worried that this could be a problem. He points out that the boss is known for being shady, and the way the dinner plans have been handled is suspicious. The fianc\u00e9 is trying to protect his fianc\u00e9, which is a common reason for concern in relationships. But is his reaction justified?\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's partner is upset because she feels her fianc\u00e9 is being controlling. She's been invited to a work dinner, and she's frustrated that he's not trusting her. She mentions that the boss is married, implying that the fianc\u00e9's worries might be unfounded. However, the fact that the boss is sending a car service and that the dinner plans have been inconsistent could be red flags. The fianc\u00e9 is using the timeline and evidence he has to make his case, which the fianc\u00e9's partner is dismissing as hoarding evidence.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Trust is a big part of a relationship. If the fianc\u00e9 has legitimate reasons to be concerned, especially based on the boss's reputation and the circumstances of the dinner, then his concerns might be valid. However, communication is key. The fianc\u00e9 should express his concerns without being overbearing. If he's using past texts and emails to show a pattern of questionable behavior, that's one thing. But if he's not allowing her to make her own decisions and is being controlling, that's a problem.\n\nThe boss's actions do seem suspicious. Changing the plans, sending a car service without considering the fianc\u00e9's input, and the way the dinner was arranged could indicate that the boss is trying to get the fianc\u00e9 alone. The fact that the dinner is only for certain people, specifically younger women, is a red flag. In some cases, this could be a form of workplace harassment or a setup for something inappropriate.\n\nBut from the partner's perspective, she might feel that her fianc\u00e9 isn't respecting her autonomy. Work dinners are common, and she might believe that he's overreacting. The argument about being a \"controlling asshole\" suggests that she feels her freedom is being restricted without justification. However, given the context, the fianc\u00e9's concerns might be legitimate, especially if there's a pattern of behavior from the boss that's problematic.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The fianc\u00e9 is trying to protect his partner, which is natural, but he needs to communicate his concerns effectively without being overbearing. The partner also has the right to make her own decisions, provided there's no immediate danger. However, if there are clear signs of inappropriate intentions from the boss, then the fianc\u00e9's concerns are valid.\n\nThe key points here are the boss's reputation, the suspicious setup of the dinner, and the fianc\u00e9's attempts to communicate his concerns. The partner dismissing those concerns as controlling behavior might be a sign that she isn't taking the potential risks seriously. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might be projecting his fears onto her, leading to a loss of trust.\n\nSo, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? If the fianc\u00e9's actions are based on legitimate concerns and he's trying to protect his partner from a potentially dangerous situation, then he's not in the wrong. However, if he's being overly controlling without valid reasons, then he is. The situation seems to have valid concerns, so the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. But it's a close call because communication styles and trust issues play a big role here.\n"
