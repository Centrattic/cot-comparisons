I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the fianc\u00e9 not wanting her to go to dinner with her boss. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who's really frustrated and considering breaking off the engagement. The key points here are the timeline and the concerns about the boss's intentions.\n\nFirst, the author details how the plans for the dinner changed multiple times. Initially, the fianc\u00e9 thought the SOs were invited, then it became a work party where the author could make other plans. Then it turned out only certain people were invited, specifically young females. The boss arranges a car service last minute, which raises red flags. The author is worried about the implications of the boss's actions and wants the fianc\u00e9 to not go, but she's insisting on attending and even calling him controlling.\n\nSo, the main issues are trust and safety. The author is concerned about the potential for inappropriate behavior, given the boss's history and the setup of the dinner. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, feels her achievements are being undermined and is defensive. The author is trying to protect her, but she sees it as controlling. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, it's normal to have concerns about a partner's safety. The author isn't preventing her from going out in general, but specifically this dinner with red flags. The boss's history and the way the dinner was arranged (last-minute car service, only young women invited) are concerning. The author is acting out of concern, not control, even though his approach might be harsh. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's reaction is also a factor. She's defensive and dismissive of his concerns, which might indicate she's not fully considering the risks. The author isn't stopping her from going to work events in general, just this one where there are clear warning signs. \n\nIn terms of controlling behavior, the author isn't restricting her movements overall, just this specific event. He's trying to discuss the concerns with evidence, which he's called \"hoarding evidence,\" but that's just him documenting the timeline. She's the one who's decided to go despite his concerns. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. He's acting in good faith to protect his fianc\u00e9 from a potentially risky situation. The answer should be B.\n"
