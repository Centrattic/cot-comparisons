I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is the fianc\u00e9 of a woman who got a job at a law firm. The boss, who's described as a shady character, is taking some employees to dinner. The timeline shows that the fianc\u00e9 keeps changing the story about who's invited. Initially, the fianc\u00e9 thought SOs were invited, but then it changes to just a work party, then it's only certain people, and finally, it's down to two female employees. The boss offers a car service, which makes the author suspicious. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't see the problem and wants to go, leading to an argument.\n\nThe author is upset because the situation seems inappropriate. The boss is married, but the author is worried about a potential harassment situation. The fianc\u00e9 is defensive, calling the author controlling. The author is considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nFirst, I should consider if the author's concerns are valid. The boss's behavior\u2014selectively inviting young female employees, offering a car service\u2014could be seen as creating an uncomfortable or inappropriate situation. The author is trying to protect their fianc\u00e9 and their relationship. However, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that the author is overreacting or being controlling by not trusting her.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is the one who kept changing the details and didn't seem to notice the red flags. The author is acting out of concern for their partner's safety and the potential for harassment. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 is defensive and dismissive of the author's valid concerns might indicate that the author's actions are justified.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for not letting the fianc\u00e9 go? It's a matter of trust and boundaries in a relationship. The author is concerned about the fianc\u00e9 being in a vulnerable position with a known shady boss. However, the author's approach\u2014telling her she \"can't go\"\u2014might be seen as overstepping, especially if the fianc\u00e9 is an adult and wants to make her own decision. The argument could be that the author should express concern but not dictate her actions. However, in a committed relationship, partners often make decisions together, especially when safety is concerned.\n\nThe key points are the boss's suspicious behavior and the fianc\u00e9's dismissiveness. If the author has valid reasons to believe the situation is inappropriate, it's reasonable to be concerned. However, the way the author is handling it (telling her she can't go) might be too controlling. The right approach might be discussing the concerns and making a mutual decision rather than unilaterally deciding.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author has valid concerns, but the method of handling it might be problematic. However, given the boss's history and the situation's red flags, the author's concern is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's reaction seems dismissive of legitimate concerns, which might make the author right in standing their ground. But the act of forbidding the fianc\u00e9 to go could be seen as controlling. It's a tough call, but I think the author is not in the wrong because they're trying to protect their partner from a potentially harmful situation, even if the approach could be better.\n"
