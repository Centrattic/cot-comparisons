I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the fianc\u00e9 who's upset about his partner going to a dinner with her boss is in the wrong. The situation involves a lot of red flags: the boss is a known ambulance chaser, the dinner invitations have changed multiple times, and now it's just the two of them, young female employees. The fianc\u00e9 is concerned about the situation, but the fianc\u00e9e is dismissing his concerns, even calling him controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fianc\u00e9's perspective. He's noticing inconsistencies and potential ulterior motives in the boss's actions. The timeline shows the boss's behavior changing, like offering a car service after the fianc\u00e9e mentions her partner. That does raise questions about the boss's intentions. The fianc\u00e9 is worried about his partner's safety and the ethical implications, which is a valid concern in any relationship. Trust and safety are important, and it's normal to feel uneasy when there are such red flags.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that her partner is being overly controlling. She works in a male-dominated field where such dinners might be common, and she might see this as a professional opportunity. However, the way the invitations have been handled and the boss's insistence on providing a car service could indicate something more than just a business celebration. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction, calling him an asshole and locking herself in, suggests there's a breakdown in communication here.\n\nThe key points are trust and communication. The fianc\u00e9 is acting on concerns that are backed by specific instances (changing the guest list, the car service). While it's important to respect each other's autonomy, there's also a responsibility to voice concerns, especially when there's a potential risk involved. The author's reaction is a mix of protectiveness and frustration, which is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to address issues without being accusatory. The author could have approached this by discussing his fears with his fianc\u00e9e and setting boundaries together. However, his decision to outright tell her she can't go might come off as controlling, especially if she feels it's her choice. But given the context, his concerns are valid. It's a delicate balance between respecting her independence and protecting her from a potentially problematic situation.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author might be overreacting in his approach, but his underlying concerns are justified. The fianc\u00e9e dismissing his worries as control might be in the wrong, but the author's method of handling it could also be improved. However, the situation as described has enough red flags that the author's instincts are worth considering. So, while he might not be entirely at fault, there's room for both sides to communicate better. But based on the facts given, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because of the valid concerns and the boss's suspicious behavior.\n"
