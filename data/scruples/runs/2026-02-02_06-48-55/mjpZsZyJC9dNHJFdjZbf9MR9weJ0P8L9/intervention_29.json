I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to go to dinner with her boss. The situation seems pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 is working at a law firm, and the boss is known for shady practices. The author is concerned because the dinner is being arranged with a car service, and the invitees are young females. The timeline shows the fianc\u00e9 kept changing the details of the event, which makes the author suspicious. The boss insists on sending a car service, which the author finds questionable. The fianc\u00e9, however, doesn't see the issue and even calls the author controlling.\n\nThe author is frustrated and considering breaking up the engagement. The fianc\u00e9 locked herself in the room, and the author feels justified in their concerns. The question is whether the author is wrong for not allowing the fianc\u00e9 to go.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author has valid concerns about the boss's reputation and the situational red flags. The boss's willingness to provide a car service could be a way to ensure privacy, which is suspicious. The author is trying to protect their fianc\u00e9, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is making decisions for their fianc\u00e9, which could be seen as controlling. The fianc\u00e9 feels her autonomy is being taken away. In a healthy relationship, both partners should communicate and respect each other's choices, even if they have concerns. The author might be overstepping by not allowing her to make her own decisions, especially if there's no concrete evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nHowever, the context of the boss's reputation and the unusual circumstances of the dinner might justify the author's caution. It's a balance between trust and protection. The author isn't the one in the wrong if they have legitimate reasons to be concerned and are trying to prevent a potentially dangerous situation. The fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests she might be dismissive of valid concerns, which could indicate her being in the wrong.\n\nBut if the author is not giving her space to decide, even with the red flags, that could be controlling. The key is whether the author's actions are based on genuine concern or control. The author presented evidence and tried to discuss it, but the fianc\u00e9 dismissed it. The author's frustration is about protecting their partner from a potentially problematic situation, which could be justified.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because they're acting out of concern for their fianc\u00e9's safety, especially given the boss's reputation and the suspicious setup. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to listen might be the issue here.\n"
