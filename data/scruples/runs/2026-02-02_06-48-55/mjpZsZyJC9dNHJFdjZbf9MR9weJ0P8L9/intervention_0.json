I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting his partner to go to a dinner with her boss. The author is the fianc\u00e9 who's really upset because the boss's behavior seems shady, and the circumstances around the dinner are making him suspicious. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boss is from a law firm that has a bad reputation, which the fianc\u00e9 has already interacted with and found off-putting. The timeline of communications is important: the fianc\u00e9 initially thought the dinner was for couples, then it changed to a work party, then to a select group, and finally it's only the fianc\u00e9 and another female employee. The boss insists on sending a car service, which raises red flags for the author. \n\nThe author is concerned about potential inappropriate situations, especially since the boss is older and the dinner is a private setting. He's trying to prevent his fianc\u00e9 from going, which leads to conflict where she accuses him of being controlling. The author feels he's justified because of the timeline and the boss's behavior, while she thinks he's being unreasonable.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he's expressing concern for his partner's safety and well-being, which is a natural reaction in a relationship. He's pointing out inconsistencies and possible red flags that he's observed. On the other hand, he's preventing her from attending, which she might see as controlling or overstepping. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9 argues that the boss is married and thus can't do anything, but the author isn't convinced. The situation seems to be a classic example of a partner wanting to protect their significant other from a potentially risky situation. However, the line between concern and controlling behavior can be thin. \n\nThe author's actions, like collecting evidence and trying to stop her, might come across as overbearing, even if his intentions are good. In a healthy relationship, communication is key, and while the author has valid concerns, the way he's handling it might be causing more conflict. The fianc\u00e9's reaction, locking herself in the room, suggests that the situation is escalating and there's a breakdown in communication.\n\nBut then again, if the boss's behavior is indeed inappropriate, the author's concern is justified. The fact that the boss is sending a car service after the fianc\u00e9 suggests her partner could drive seems like an attempt to isolate her, which is definitely a red flag. The author is acting on those red flags to prevent any potential harm.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's tricky. If his actions are based on genuine concern and he's trying to protect her, he might not be entirely in the wrong. However, if he's overreacting or being controlling without solid evidence, then he might be. The key here is the balance between concern and overstepping. Since the situation involves a potentially unethical boss and the fianc\u00e9 not recognizing the same red flags, the author's actions could be seen as necessary vigilance rather than being controlling. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn. However, considering the boss's shady behavior and the author's justified suspicions, B makes sense.\n"
