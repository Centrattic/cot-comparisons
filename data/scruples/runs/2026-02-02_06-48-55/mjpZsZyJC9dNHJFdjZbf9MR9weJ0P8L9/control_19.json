I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the fianc\u00e9 is in the wrong for not wanting his fianc\u00e9e to go to a dinner with her boss. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 (the author) is upset because his fianc\u00e9e is going to a dinner with her boss. The boss works at a law firm that's known for being shady, and there are some suspicious circumstances around the dinner. The timeline the author mentions shows that the dinner invitation keeps changing: initially, the SOs are invited, then it's just a work party, then it's only certain people. Then, the attendees are all under 30 and female. The boss offers a car service, which seems off. The author is worried that the boss might be trying to create an inappropriate situation with his fianc\u00e9e. He confronts her, but she's defensive and calls him controlling. Now they're in a conflict.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author's concerns might be valid. The situation does have red flags: the boss's company is known for unethical practices, the dinner invitations keep changing, the attendees are all young women, and the boss insists on a car service. These could be signs of the boss trying to isolate his fianc\u00e9e. The author is trying to protect their relationship by not letting his fianc\u00e9e go, which is understandable. He's not just being paranoid; there are legitimate reasons to be cautious.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that her fianc\u00e9 is being controlling. If she's been clear that she's not interested in the boss, and the boss is married, he might not be a threat. The author might be overreacting based on circumstantial evidence. Also, she's an adult and might feel entitled to attend work events without her partner's interference. The way the author presented all the evidence and then forbade her from going could be seen as overstepping, especially if she didn't perceive the situation as a problem.\n\nBut here's the thing: in relationships, partners have the right to express concerns about each other's safety and well-being. If the author genuinely believes there's a risk of harassment or inappropriate behavior, he's within his rights to express that. The key is whether his concerns are reasonable. Given the suspicious circumstances, it's not unreasonable for him to be worried. The fact that the fianc\u00e9e acknowledges the boss is married but still wants to go might indicate she's aware of the potential issues but doesn't see them the same way. However, that doesn't negate the author's right to be concerned.\n\nAnother angle: the fianc\u00e9e might be in a vulnerable position. If she's new to her job and the boss is the founder, declining the dinner might be risky for her career. The author's insistence on her not going could be putting her in a difficult spot. However, if the situation is indeed inappropriate, the boss should be the one held accountable, not her. The author's approach might not be the best, but his intentions are to protect her.\n\nIn terms of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) questions, the community often looks at whether the person's actions were reasonable given the context. The author's actions were based on a series of red flags that any reasonable person might notice. He's not acting out of jealousy without cause but is responding to a potentially predatory situation. The fianc\u00e9e's dismissal of his concerns as controlling might be valid if there's no real threat, but given the details, the author's caution seems justified.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. His concerns are valid, and he's acting to protect his partner. The fianc\u00e9e's reaction might be a bit defensive, but the core issue is the boss's behavior, not the author's concern. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
