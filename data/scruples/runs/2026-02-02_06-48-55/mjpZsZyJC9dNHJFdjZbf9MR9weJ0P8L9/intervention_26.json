I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 not wanting his partner to attend a dinner with her boss, leading to a major argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The fianc\u00e9 is working at a law firm known for aggressive marketing, and the boss has a reputation. The author is concerned because the boss is arranging a car service for her, and the attendees are all young female employees. The fianc\u00e9 is frustrated because the author is being overprotective, calling him controlling.\n\nThe author provides a timeline where the fianc\u00e9 changes the plans multiple times, which the author finds suspicious. The boss's last-minute car service adds to the author's suspicion. The author is worried about potential inappropriate situations, especially since the boss is known for shady practices.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants confirmation. The question is whether the author has a valid reason to be concerned or if he's being controlling. \n\nOn one hand, the author's concerns might stem from reasonable doubt given the boss's reputation and the circumstances. The boss's quick response about the car service could imply he's trying to control the situation, which is a red flag. The fact that only young female employees are invited might make the author's worries about harassment valid.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is restricting his fianc\u00e9's autonomy by saying she can't go. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and without concrete evidence of wrongdoing, preventing her from attending might be seen as controlling. The fianc\u00e9 might feel her independence is being undermined, which could be why she's reacting so strongly.\n\nBut considering the boss's history and the unusual circumstances\u2014like the last-minute car service\u2014the author's suspicion isn't entirely baseless. In a healthy relationship, communication is key. The author tried to discuss his concerns, but instead of addressing them, the fianc\u00e9 dismissed his worries. However, the author's method of stopping her from attending might be too extreme without her consent.\n\nThe key here is balancing trust with valid concerns. The author isn't the one in the wrong if there's a legitimate reason to be cautious. But if there's no actual evidence, it's about overstepping. Since the boss's actions are questionable and the author's concerns are based on patterns (like previous instances of the company's unethical behavior), his reaction might be justified. However, the way he's handling it\u2014telling her she can't go\u2014could be seen as overbearing.\n\nSo, the answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because his concerns are based on the boss's history and suspicious behavior, even if his approach could be better. But this is a nuanced situation where both sides have points. The fianc\u00e9's autonomy is important, but so is protecting her from potential harm. The author's actions are a reaction to a potentially unsafe situation, even if his method is heavy-handed.\n"
