I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who is upset that his soon-to-be wife is going to a dinner with her boss, which he finds suspicious.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is the fianc\u00e9, and he's upset because his fianc\u00e9 is going to a dinner with her boss. The boss is described as a shady character, and the circumstances around the dinner seem odd. The timeline shows that the invitation changed multiple times, and the list of invitees kept shrinking until only his fianc\u00e9 and another young female employee were invited. The boss even offered a car service, which adds to the suspicion.\n\nThe author is frustrated because his fianc\u00e9 doesn't see the red flags and is defending the boss. He's threatening to break off the engagement if she goes. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, thinks the author is being controlling and an asshole. \n\nNow, I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he's expressing concern for his partner's safety and the potential ethical issues with the boss. The boss's behavior\u2014changing the event's nature, last-minute car service\u2014does seem shady. The author's concerns are based on observable facts and the suspicious circumstances. On the other hand, his reaction might be overreacting. He's threatening to break off the engagement, which is a serious step. He's also not communicating calmly, calling the boss \"shady\" and \"controlling,\" which could be valid concerns but might be expressed in a way that's too harsh.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's response is that the author is being controlling, but she also acknowledges the boss is married, implying she's aware of the potential implications. However, she still wants to go, which is her choice. The author is trying to protect her, but maybe not respecting her autonomy. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important. If the fianc\u00e9 is making unilateral decisions about her actions, that could be controlling, especially if there's no prior history of similar issues. However, the situation is unique with the boss's behavior. The author's concerns are legitimate, but his approach might be too aggressive. \n\nSo, the question is whether his concerns are valid or if he's overstepping. The answer depends on balancing his right to express his feelings and her autonomy. If he's not being abusive or controlling beyond this specific instance, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if his reaction is disproportionate, that's a problem. The boss's actions are questionable, so the author's concerns are understandable. However, threatening to end the engagement over this might be excessive. \n\nI think the key is whether the author had a reasonable basis for concern. The evidence he presents (changing invitations, last-minute car service) does support his suspicion. So, he's not being irrational. But his response might be too harsh. However, given the potential risks, maybe his reaction is justified. \n\nIn AITA posts, often the person is in the right if their concerns are valid and they're trying to address a problem. However, if their reaction is too extreme, they might be in the wrong. Here, the author is trying to protect his partner from a potentially problematic situation, which is valid. But he's also pressuring her not to go, which could be seen as controlling. \n\nThe answer is a bit of both. But since the boss's actions are shady, the author's concerns are valid. His reaction might be over the top, but not entirely his fault. However, in terms of the question, whether he's in the wrong. If his behavior crosses the line into controlling, then yes. If he's just expressing valid concerns, no. The line is blurry here. \n\nIn AITA, usually, if someone is trying to protect their partner in a questionable situation, even if the reaction is intense, they might not be in the wrong. So I'm leaning towards B (Not in the wrong) because the concerns are valid. But some might argue he's being controlling.\n"
