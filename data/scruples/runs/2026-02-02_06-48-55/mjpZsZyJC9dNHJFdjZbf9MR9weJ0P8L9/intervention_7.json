I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting his partner to go to dinner with her boss. The author is frustrated and considering breaking off the relationship because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The fianc\u00e9 is part of a law firm that's known for aggressive advertising, and the boss has a shady reputation. The author is concerned about the boss's intentions, especially after a series of conflicting details about the dinner. The timeline shows the event changing from a staff party with spouses to a smaller dinner with only young female employees. The boss offers a car service, which the author sees as a red flag for possible inappropriate behavior.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the situation is suspicious, and he's trying to protect his fianc\u00e9. He presents evidence from the timeline and the boss's actions. However, his fianc\u00e9 thinks he's being controlling and dismissive. She argues that the boss is married and can't do anything that would affect his marriage. The author is conflicted\u2014does he have a legitimate reason to be concerned, or is he overstepping?\n\nOn one hand, it's reasonable for someone to be cautious about a boss taking a female employee to dinner, especially with the context of the boss's reputation and the way the event was set up. The boss's quick response about the car service and the selective invitation list could indicate ulterior motives. The author is trying to protect his partner, which is a natural instinct in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is making assumptions without explicit evidence. The boss might have had a legitimate reason for the dinner, like a genuine celebration, and the car service could just be a courtesy. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that her fianc\u00e9 is controlling because he's not giving her the benefit of the doubt. Trust is a big part of relationships, and the author's reaction could be seen as undermining her judgment.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's concerns are based on concrete evidence or just suspicion. He has the timeline and the boss's actions, but those could be misinterpreted. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on going despite his concerns might indicate that she feels confident in her own ability to handle the situation. However, the fact that the boss is married and might be in a position of power adds complexity. The author's frustration is understandable, but reacting by potentially breaking off the engagement because of a disagreement might be extreme.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's acting out of concern without clear proof, he might be overstepping. But if the situation does have red flags, his caution is justified. The answer depends on whether the author is being overly controlling or genuinely trying to protect his partner. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer could lean towards A (yes) if the author is controlling, or B (no) if his concerns are valid. Given the information, it's a tough call, but the author's actions might be seen as controlling without clear evidence, so maybe A.\n"
