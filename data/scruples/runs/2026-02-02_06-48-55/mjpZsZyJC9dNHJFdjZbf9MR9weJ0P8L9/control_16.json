I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9 being invited to a dinner with her boss, which the author is really against. \n\nFirst, the author is concerned because the boss is known for shady practices, and there's a series of confusing changes about the event. The fianc\u00e9 is going with a car service arranged by the boss, and the author feels it's inappropriate. The fianc\u00e9 is upset, calling the author controlling. The author is frustrated and considering breaking off the engagement.\n\nI need to assess if the author's actions are justified. Jealousy in relationships is common, but controlling behavior isn't. The key points here are the timeline of events, the boss's reputation, and the fianc\u00e9's insistence on going despite the author's concerns.\n\nThe author's main issue is the boss's behavior, especially the car service arranged at the last minute. The fianc\u00e9 downplays the situation. The author isn't preventing her from going out per se, but is objecting to the specific dinner with the boss. The question is whether this is a reasonable concern or overstepping.\n\nIn terms of trust, the author has valid reasons to be suspicious given the boss's history and the unusual circumstances of the dinner invitation. However, the author's reaction (threatening to break off the engagement) and labeling the fianc\u00e9 as not in a good situation might be extreme. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's dismissive attitude could be problematic. \n\nThe author isn't physically preventing her from going, but the emotional pressure might be a form of control. The fianc\u00e9's boss being a known ambulance chaser adds context. The author is trying to protect the relationship, but the approach might be harsh. \n\nConsidering all that, the author might have valid concerns but is handling it in a way that could be seen as controlling. The fianc\u00e9 might need to consider the risks of attending the dinner. However, since the author isn't dictating her actions but expressing deep concerns, it's a balance between trust and safety in the relationship.\n\nIn AITA terms, it's tricky. The author isn't in the wrong for having concerns, but the way they're enforced might be. The fianc\u00e9's boss's behavior is questionable, so the author's caution is understandable. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they're trying to protect the relationship from potential harm, even if their methods are stressful. But there's a nuance here where both parties have valid points. However, based on the question format (A or B), the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
