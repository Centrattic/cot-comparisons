I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the fianc\u00e9 not wanting his partner to go to a dinner with her boss. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who is really upset about this and is considering breaking off the relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The boss is described as a shady character\u2014part of a law firm that's known for ambulance-chasing, and the author has met him and felt uncomfortable. The dinner invitation has a strange timeline: initially, the fianc\u00e9 thought the author's presence was okay, then it changed to just a work party, then it became selective. The people invited are all under 30 and female, which raises red flags. Then the boss offers a car service, which seems like a possible attempt to control or isolate the fianc\u00e9 from her partner.\n\nThe author is concerned about the situation and tries to stop her from going, leading to an argument where the fianc\u00e9 calls him controlling. The key points here are the boss's questionable reputation, the suspicious nature of the dinner (selective invites, last-minute changes), and the fianc\u00e9's refusal to take the offered car service, which the author sees as a risk.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions. He's expressing his concerns based on evidence (text messages, the timeline, the boss's behavior). He's not preventing her from going outright but is voicing his objections. The fianc\u00e9 is planning to go regardless, and the author is frustrated because he feels the situation is unsafe. \n\nIs the author being overbearing? Well, he's not physically preventing her from going, just expressing his concerns. However, the boss's actions (offering a car service after the fianc\u00e9 suggests driving herself) do seem manipulative. The author's main concern is the potential for inappropriate situations, especially with the boss being known as a scammer. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that her partner is being too controlling, not trusting her, or overstepping by using the texts to question her. But given the boss's history and the suspicious circumstances, the author's concerns aren't unfounded. He's trying to protect his fianc\u00e9 from a potentially dangerous situation. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on how reasonable his concerns are. If the boss is a known problematic individual and the dinner setup is shady, the author's reaction is justified. The fianc\u00e9's dismissal of his concerns and insistence on going despite the risks might indicate a lack of consideration for his feelings and the potential dangers. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's voicing his legitimate concerns based on the evidence provided. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, might be in the wrong for not acknowledging the risks and dismissing his valid worries as controlling behavior. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
