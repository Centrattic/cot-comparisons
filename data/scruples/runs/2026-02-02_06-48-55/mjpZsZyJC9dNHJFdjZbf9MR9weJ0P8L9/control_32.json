I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the fianc\u00e9) is in the wrong for not wanting his fianc\u00e9e to go to dinner with her boss. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The fianc\u00e9e works at a law firm that's known for maybe not having the best reputation. The boss is described as an ambulance chaser, which isn't great. The author is feeling uneasy because the dinner with the boss keeps getting described in a way that seems suspicious. The timeline shows that the fianc\u00e9e initially said both of them could go, then changed her mind, then the invite list narrows down to just her and another young female employee. The boss offers a car service, which the author sees as a red flag because it might be to avoid having the fianc\u00e9e's partner drive her.\n\nThe author is concerned about the potential for inappropriate behavior or at least an uncomfortable situation. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, doesn't see the issue and is pushing to go, even calling the author controlling. \n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author overstepping by not letting her go, or is he justified in his concerns?\n\nFrom what I can see, the author has valid reasons to be worried. The boss's behavior\u2014changing plans last minute, offering a car service\u2014could be seen as trying to create a situation where they're alone. The fact that the invite is only for young female employees adds to the suspicion. The author is trying to protect his fianc\u00e9e, which is a common concern in relationships. However, he's also making the decision for her, which could be seen as controlling. \n\nBut then, the fianc\u00e9e isn't acknowledging the red flags. If she's in a position where her boss is showing preferential treatment or trying to isolate her, it's a problem. The author's actions are based on the timeline and evidence he's observed, which is reasonable. He's not just being paranoid; there are specific actions from the boss that point to possible ulterior motives.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e might feel that her autonomy is being violated. She could argue that she's an adult and can handle herself. But if the situation is indeed as shady as described, her judgment might be clouded by wanting to please her boss or not seeing the risks.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's concerns are legitimate. He's acting out of a desire to protect his partner from a potentially harmful situation. While it's important for couples to respect each other's autonomy, the context here suggests that the author isn't being unreasonable. The boss's behavior is questionable, and the author is trying to prevent a scenario that could lead to issues for both his fianc\u00e9e and their relationship.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
