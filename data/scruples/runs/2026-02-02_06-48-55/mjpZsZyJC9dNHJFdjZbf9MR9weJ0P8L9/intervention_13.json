I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author, who is the fianc\u00e9 in the scenario, is in the wrong for not wanting her fianc\u00e9 to go to dinner with his boss. The situation seems pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The fianc\u00e9e's boss is part of a law firm that's known for being a bit sketchy\u2014like ambulance chasers. The boss is described as a scammer, though maybe he's better in person. The fianc\u00e9e works there, and there's a series of changes in the dinner plans. Initially, the fianc\u00e9e thought the SOs were invited, then it became a work party, then it was narrowed down to only certain people. The author (the fianc\u00e9) is getting suspicious because the people invited are mostly young women, and the boss is arranging a car service. The fianc\u00e9e insists it's fine, but the author is worried about the boss's intentions and wants her not to go. They argue, and the fianc\u00e9e calls him controlling. The author is now considering breaking off the relationship.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. Let me think about this from different angles. \n\nTrust is a big part of any relationship. The author is trying to protect his fianc\u00e9e from a potentially uncomfortable or dangerous situation, especially given the boss's reputation. The boss's actions\u2014like sending a car service after the fianc\u00e9e mentions her partner might drive\u2014could be seen as trying to create a private setting. The author is pointing out these red flags based on the timeline and changes in the dinner plans. \n\nBut then again, the author is making a lot of assumptions. He's interpreting the boss's actions as shady without direct evidence. The fianc\u00e9e, on the other hand, doesn't see the same issues and is going anyway. There's a communication problem here. The author is using the texts and emails to support his concerns, but the fianc\u00e9e calls him controlling. \n\nIs the author overreacting? Well, the boss's behavior does raise some legitimate concerns. The fact that the dinner is only with young female employees, the sudden car service, and the firm's reputation could all be factors. The author's intention is to protect his partner, which is understandable. However, he's not giving her the benefit of the doubt and is trying to prevent her from attending, which she feels is controlling. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't accusing the boss of any wrongdoing directly but is acting on suspicion based on the firm's public image and the boss's actions. The fianc\u00e9e doesn't seem to see the same issues, which could indicate a lack of awareness on her part. \n\nBut where is the line between being protective and being controlling? The author is expressing his concerns using evidence, but the fianc\u00e9e feels he's withholding information (\"hoarding evidence\") to control the situation. The key here might be whether the author has a valid reason to be concerned or if he's projecting without evidence. The boss's actions could be innocent\u2014maybe he's just trying to be generous or the dinner is a genuine celebration. \n\nHowever, given the context of the firm's reputation and the boss's behavior, it's not unreasonable for the author to be cautious. The author's reaction is based on the timeline and the boss's actions, which do seem suspicious. The fianc\u00e9e dismissing these concerns as the author being a controlling asshole might be the bigger issue here. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's acting out of genuine concern for her safety and the situation's context, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's being overly controlling without evidence, then he might be. However, the fact that he's trying to communicate his concerns and she's dismissing them as controlling might indicate that he's not the one at fault. The situation is a bit of a gray area, but considering the boss's reputation and the actions taken, the author's concerns are valid. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
