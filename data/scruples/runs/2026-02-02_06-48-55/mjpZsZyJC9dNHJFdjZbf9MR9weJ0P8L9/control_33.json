I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 being upset that his fianc\u00e9e is going to a dinner with her boss, which he perceives as shady.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boss is described as an ambulance chaser with a reputation as a scammer. The timeline shows the fianc\u00e9e kept changing details about the dinner. Initially, the fianc\u00e9 was okay with going, but as he found out more details\u2014like only young female employees being invited, the boss arranging a car service\u2014it raised red flags. The fianc\u00e9 is concerned about the potential for inappropriate situations and is trying to protect his fianc\u00e9e, which is a valid concern in a relationship.\n\nThe author's actions: he's not physically preventing her from going, but he's expressing strong opposition and asking her not to go. He's using the information he's gathered to voice his concerns. The fianc\u00e9e is upset, calling him controlling, but the author is trying to protect her. \n\nIs he overstepping? Well, the fianc\u00e9 isn't controlling her directly; he's expressing his concerns based on the situation's oddities. The boss's behavior (last-minute car service) seems suspicious. The other person (the fianc\u00e9e) is in a position where she might be vulnerable, especially if the boss is known for unethical practices. \n\nThe author's frustration comes from the fianc\u00e9e not recognizing the potential danger. However, he's also in a committed relationship, so his concern is about her safety and the integrity of their relationship. He's not forcing her to do anything, just trying to get her to reconsider. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Maybe not. He has legitimate concerns based on the situation. On the flip side, maybe the fianc\u00e9e should have considered his feelings more, especially since he's not just being paranoid\u2014there are specific red flags. But the author is not stopping her, just trying to communicate. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e might have a right to go, but the author has every right to be concerned given the circumstances. The key here is whether the author is being controlling versus protective. Since he's not controlling her actions but voicing reasonable concerns, he's in the right.\n"
