I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting their fianc\u00e9 to go to dinner with her boss. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 works at a law firm founded by a guy with a shady reputation. The boss is known for aggressive advertising and has a bad reputation. The fianc\u00e9 was supposed to go to a dinner with the boss, but the details keep changing. The author notices that the invitees are young and female, which raises red flags. The boss is offering a car service, which seems suspicious. The author is concerned about potential inappropriate situations, especially given the boss's history and the last-minute changes. The fianc\u00e9, however, is dismissive and thinks her fianc\u00e9 is being controlling.\n\nThe author's main points are the timeline of the dinner arrangements, the boss's behavior (like insisting on a car service), and the demographics of the invitees. The fianc\u00e9's reaction is defensive, calling the author controlling. The author feels justified due to the red flags but is now in conflict with their partner.\n\nNow, considering the AITA framework, we need to assess if the author's concerns are reasonable. The boss's behavior does seem off\u2014last-minute changes, targeting young female employees, offering a car service to avoid the spouse. The author's distrust is based on concrete examples, not just jealousy. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to acknowledge these signs might indicate she's downplaying legitimate issues. The author's reaction is protective, wanting to avoid a potentially risky situation for their partner, especially since they're engaged and planning a future together. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's perspective is that she trusts her employer and feels her fianc\u00e9 is overstepping by controlling her decisions. However, given the context provided, the author's concerns seem valid. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting her to go. Since the author has a justified reason based on the boss's history and behavior, and the fianc\u00e9 isn't heeding the warnings, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), as the author's actions are based on reasonable concerns about her partner's safety and the unethical environment she's in.\n"
