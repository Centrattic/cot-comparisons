I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting his fianc\u00e9 to go to dinner with her boss. The situation involves a lot of red flags. The boss is described as a shady character, and the dinner seems to have been set up in a way that's suspicious. The author points out that the timing and details around the dinner change multiple times, which makes him uneasy. The fianc\u00e9 is going despite his concerns, and he's calling her a controlling asshole, which has caused a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's main concern is that the dinner is a setup for something inappropriate, especially since the boss insists on sending a car service, which could be a way to avoid any oversight. The fact that only young female employees are invited adds to the suspicion. The author is trying to protect his fianc\u00e9, which seems reasonable. However, he's also being confrontational and accusatory, which might be contributing to the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that her fianc\u00e9 is overreacting and not trusting her. She's been upfront about the dinner plans, even if the details changed. The key here is whether the author's concerns are valid or if he's being controlling. The boss's behavior\u2014changing the plans, sending a car\u2014could indicate ulterior motives. The author is trying to prevent a potentially harmful situation, which is a valid concern. However, the way he's handling it by not allowing her to go might be overstepping, especially if she feels her autonomy is being violated.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's actions are justified by the red flags or if he's being too controlling without sufficient evidence. While the red flags are significant, the author's approach (calling her a controlling asshole) is not helpful. However, his underlying concern is about her safety and the boss's intentions. So, I think the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the situation is genuinely suspicious, but his communication could be improved. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because his concerns are based on valid observations, even if the execution is poor.\n"
