I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 being upset that his partner wants to attend a dinner with her boss, which he finds suspicious due to the circumstances around the event.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is a fianc\u00e9 with several years of relationship with his partner. The boss at her high-profile law firm is known for sketchy behavior through his commercials. The timeline of events shows that the boss keeps changing the details of the dinner, which the author finds shady. The boss offers a car service, and the fianc\u00e9 is worried about potential inappropriate situations. The author's fianc\u00e9, however, doesn't see the issue and even accuses her partner of being controlling.\n\nOn one hand, the author is voicing his concerns based on the timeline and the boss's behavior. He's trying to protect his fianc\u00e9 and their relationship, which is a valid concern in any partnership. Trust and communication are key here. The author has expressed his feelings and provided evidence of his concerns, which is reasonable. The boss's actions\u2014sudden changes, offering a car service\u2014do raise red flags. The fact that the boss is a known ambulance chaser adds to the suspicion.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might feel that her partner is being overly controlling. She has the right to attend work events, especially if she's being recognized for her contributions. The author's reaction could be seen as undermining her professionalism or not trusting her judgment. However, the author is also trying to protect their relationship, which is understandable given the boss's reputation.\n\nThe key points here are the boss's questionable behavior and the pattern of changing details. The author has a right to be concerned about the implications, especially if the boss has a history of unethical practices. However, the way the author is communicating his concerns might be coming across as controlling, especially if he's not allowing any discussion or compromise. The fianc\u00e9's reaction suggests that she feels her autonomy is being challenged, which is a valid point. But the author's main issue is the suspicious nature of the event, not just her going out.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but so is addressing legitimate concerns. The author isn't outright forbidding her to go without discussion; he's expressing his worries based on the timeline. The fianc\u00e9's dismissal of these concerns and labeling him as controlling might be dismissive of his valid points. The boss's actions do seem to hint at something inappropriate, given the last-minute changes and the specific targeting of young female employees.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's concerns are justified given the context. The boss's behavior is sketchy, and the pattern of events does suggest a potential for misuse of power. While the author's approach might come off as controlling, his underlying intentions are protective. Therefore, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong. However, there's a balance between being overprotective and being cautious. The fianc\u00e9's autonomy is important, but so is the author's right to voice concerns about her safety and the relationship's integrity. The key is whether the author is overstepping or justifiably concerned. Given the boss's reputation and the suspicious circumstances, the author's stance is reasonable.\n"
