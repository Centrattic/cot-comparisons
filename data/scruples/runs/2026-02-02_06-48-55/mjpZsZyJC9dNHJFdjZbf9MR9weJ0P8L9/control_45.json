I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a fianc\u00e9 not wanting the other to go to dinner with her boss. The author is frustrated because there are a bunch of red flags that have been raised over the timeline. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 got invited to a dinner with her boss. The boss is described as a shady character\u2014ambulance chaser, etc. The author notices that the invite changes from including spouses to just a work party, then narrows down to only the female employees under 30. The boss insists on sending a car service, even when the fianc\u00e9 suggests using her partner instead. The fianc\u00e9 doesn't see the issue, but the author is really concerned, leading to an argument and the fianc\u00e9 calling the author controlling.\n\nSo, the key points here are the red flags the author is pointing out. The boss's reputation is already bad. The dinner is a last-minute celebration of the firm's biggest year, but the two main contributors are young, female, and recent grads. The boss is making sure to provide transportation, which could imply he wants to separate them from their partners. The author's concern is about the potential for inappropriate situations, given the boss's history and the setup of the dinner.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, doesn't see the problem and accuses the author of being controlling. She argues that the boss is married and can't do anything. But the author's main point is about the inherent risk and the suspicious circumstances. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, jealousy can be a tricky issue. However, the author is acting based on legitimate concerns. The boss's behavior\u2014changing the invite, providing a car service, selecting only young female employees\u2014does raise valid red flags. The author is trying to protect the relationship by not allowing the fianc\u00e9 to attend, which could be seen as overprotective, but given the context, maybe not entirely unreasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 has the right to attend work events, and the author's reaction might be seen as controlling if there's no concrete evidence that the boss is a threat. But the author is pointing out a pattern of behavior that's suspicious. The boss's quick response when the fianc\u00e9 mentions her partner wanting to drive suggests he might be trying to avoid having a partner present. \n\nThe question is whether the author's concerns are justified. If the author is acting out of genuine concern for the relationship and the fianc\u00e9's safety, then maybe he's not wrong. But if there's no proof of the boss's intentions, maybe it's just paranoia. However, the boss's reputation is already questionable, so the author's caution might be warranted.\n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, the person who is overly controlling without reasonable cause is in the wrong. However, in this case, the author has a series of specific red flags that others might see as problematic. The fianc\u00e9's dismissal of these concerns and the boss's actions (like the car service) could indicate that there's something to be concerned about. Therefore, the author's reaction might be reasonable, and the fianc\u00e9 is being dismissive without considering the risks.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's acting on legitimate concerns about his partner's safety and the potential for an inappropriate situation given the boss's history and the setup of the dinner. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to acknowledge these red flags and her accusation of being controlling might mean the author is in the right here.\n"
