I guess this question is among my last salvos to see if i'm being an asshole and unreasonable. Or if the problem is on her end. \n\nBeen with fianc\u00e9 for several years now. She recently graduated and got an amazing HR job with a pretty high profile \"we get your DUI charges dropped!\" type law firm. The guy who started the firm is known across as being an ambulance chaser, shyster and scammer because very frankly he's trying to portray that in his commercials. I've met him a couple of times and in person, he's a little better but I stew kind of feel like I needed a shower. \n\nSo right after New Years, wife came home and announced that Lawyer dude is taking the whole staff out to celebrate on January 20th because it was the firms biggest year ever. This is the timeline as near I can remember:\n\n- January 5th, she tells me to keep January 20th open because SO's are invited. Cool, I can do that. \n\n- January 8th. Sorry she was mistaken, it's just a work party she tells me it's cool if I make other plans that night. No problem. \n\n- January 13th. She lets it slip, it's not really a party for the whole office, just for the people boss thinks were part of the success. I'm starting to get a little WTF'y here. \n\n- January 14th. Miraculously, all the people going to dinner with the boss are under the age of 30 and female.  Now alarm bells are really going off. \n\n- January 18th. The list is down to two people, my wife and another new attorney. So, if I'm hearing this correctly, the two people mainly responsible for this 20 year old company's \"biggest year ever\" are both recent college grads, both female and both around 25? Fiance says \"aren't you proud of me!\" \n\n\n- Today, the big day boss texts her at like 11AM and says \"hey since this is supposed to be a celebration, don't drive! I'll send a car service for you!\" Fiance still doesn't smell anything fishy so I ask her just for my own edification ask what he says if she tells him \"that's a great offer, but my fiance knows the restaurant and he can drive me.\" Boss replies back in seconds \"sorry if I had to change restaurants at the last minute, I'll send the car!\" \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 looks at me, apparently without the screeching submarine klaxon and klieg lights that are going off in my head, and says \"see it's all cool, I'll just take the car service.\" \n\nI'm freaking the fuck out. I told her that she can't go. She called me a controlling asshole. I told her that this whole thing has bene shady as fuck and I relayed out the timeline I just posted above using my texts and emails from her as evidence. She said that me \"hoarding evidence\" like this is an example of how I'm a \"controlling asshole\" and she wants to go to the dinner now more than ever. I told her I might be an asshole but I'm not stupid. \n\nShe told me over and over again \"he's married, he CAN'T do anything that would affect his marriage, so you're being the stupid one!\" That leads me to believe that even she understands the larger implications that are at play here. \n\nShe locked herself in our bedroom and hasn't come out for at least an hour. \n\nI don't know what to do. I can't beat the door down or yell at her and I think if this is one of those situations where the shoe was on the other foot, she'd be freaking the fuck out and I'd see her reaction and just call it off.\n\n AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9 wanting to go to a dinner with her boss, and he's really upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author is a fianc\u00e9 who has been in a relationship for several years. His fianc\u00e9 got a job at a law firm that's known for being a bit shady, with a boss who's a controversial figure. The boss is inviting some employees to a dinner, and the author is concerned because the invitees are all young, female, and the boss is making last-minute arrangements to send a car for the fianc\u00e9. The fianc\u00e9 initially told him the event was for spouses, then changed her story, and the boss is now arranging transportation, which the author sees as suspicious.\n\nThe author is frustrated because he thinks the situation is shady and doesn't want his fianc\u00e9 to go. He's called her a controlling asshole, and she's locked herself in their room. The author is considering breaking off the relationship.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Well, the key points here are about trust and communication in a relationship. The author has valid concerns based on the boss's reputation and the way the dinner was organized. The boss's behavior, like sending a car service and changing the event details, might be inappropriate. The author is acting on these concerns to protect the relationship.\n\nHowever, the author's approach might be too controlling. He's not giving his fianc\u00e9 the benefit of the doubt and is making accusations without clear evidence of wrongdoing. The fianc\u00e9 might feel that her autonomy is being violated by his insistence that she can't go. Relationships require trust, and if the author isn't trusting his fianc\u00e9 without concrete proof, that could be a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 has a responsibility to be transparent. She kept changing the details of the event and didn't seem to notice the red flags, which could be a sign of her being unaware or perhaps in denial about her boss's intentions. The author's frustration is understandable, but his response (calling her controlling and possibly breaking off the relationship) might be disproportionate.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's acting out of concern but is overstepping by being controlling, then maybe he's partially at fault. But if the boss's behavior is genuinely inappropriate and the author is trying to prevent a potentially harmful situation, then he's acting in good faith. The fianc\u00e9's insistence on going despite the red flags could be her being in the wrong, but the author's methods of handling it might be where he's wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be a mix. However, the user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to decide between A (Yes) or B (No). The key is whether the author's actions are reasonable. Since he's acting on legitimate concerns but may be being overly controlling, it's a gray area. However, in relationships, trust is crucial. If the author doesn't have concrete evidence of his fianc\u00e9's infidelity or inappropriate behavior, his response might be too harsh. Therefore, he could be in the wrong for not trusting her and being controlling. But if the boss is a known problematic person, maybe the author is justified. It's tricky. I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong because he has valid concerns about a potentially inappropriate situation and is trying to protect the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's boss's actions are suspicious, and the author is acting on those suspicions. However, his communication style is poor. But in terms of being in the wrong, the main issue is the fianc\u00e9's boss's behavior, not the author's concern. So B.\n"
