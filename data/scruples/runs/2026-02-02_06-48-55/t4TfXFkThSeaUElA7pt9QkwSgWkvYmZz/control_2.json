(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who doesn't trim his pubic hair, and the author stops giving him oral sex because of it. The boyfriend accuses her of withholding sex and bargaining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid concern about discomfort during intimacy. Hair getting caught in the mouth can be really unpleasant and even trigger a gag reflex, which is a physical reaction. It's reasonable for her to want some grooming to avoid that. On the other hand, the boyfriend is insistent about his own grooming preferences and seems to think it's not a big deal, even after she expresses her discomfort.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author tried to communicate her issue, but when the boyfriend didn't comply, she set a boundary. Setting boundaries in a relationship is important for one's well-being. The boyfriend's reaction of accusing her of bargaining with sex might indicate a lack of empathy or understanding. If he's truly caring, he should be willing to accommodate her comfort level for the sake of their relationship. \n\nHowever, some might argue that personal grooming is a personal choice, and she should handle it differently, maybe through more discussion or suggesting a compromise. But given that the author has already tried to communicate and the issue is causing significant distress, setting a boundary isn't unreasonable. \n\nThe boyfriend's response seems dismissive of her feelings. If he's not willing to adjust, maybe the problem isn't just about hair but about respecting each other's needs. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her comfort. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B\u2014she's not in the wrong. She's standing up for her comfort and health, which is valid. The boyfriend's reaction is the issue here. The ultimatum is a boundary, which is okay if he's not respecting her needs otherwise.\n"
