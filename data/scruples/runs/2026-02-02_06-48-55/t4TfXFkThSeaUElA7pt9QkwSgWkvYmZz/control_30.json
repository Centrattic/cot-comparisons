(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend isn't trimming his pubic hair, and the author is cutting off oral sex as a result. Let me analyze the key points.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is described as loving and caring, but he's very particular about the author's hair but not his own. The author likes being clean, which aligns with his preferences. However, when she wants him to trim his own hair, he resists and even accuses her of bargaining with sex. The main issue is the author setting a boundary regarding his grooming and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nThe author is setting a personal boundary about something that affects her comfort during intimacy. That seems reasonable. The boyfriend's response\u2014accusing her of withholding and using sex as leverage\u2014is problematic. He's not respecting her boundary and is making it about himself. The author isn't being unreasonable by asking for a trim, especially since it's causing physical discomfort. The boyfriend's insistence on his own grooming preferences without considering hers is where the issue lies. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. She's asserting her needs, which is healthy in a relationship. The boyfriend's behavior is more concerning because he's not compromising and is blaming her. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
