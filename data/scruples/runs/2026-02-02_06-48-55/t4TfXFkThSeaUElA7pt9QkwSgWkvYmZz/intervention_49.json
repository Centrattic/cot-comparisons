(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who's insistent on the author keeping her body hair clean but he himself has a lot of body hair, especially in the pubic area. The author has decided to cut off oral sex because of the hair, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of using sex as leverage.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that her boyfriend is otherwise caring and loving, but his body hair is an issue. He wants her clean-shaven, but he himself doesn't trim his own hair, leading to clumps of hair that make oral sex unpleasant for her. She sets a boundary and he reacts negatively, which she finds frustrating.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and communication. The author has a legitimate reason for discomfort\u2014physical issues during intimacy. Setting boundaries around one's own body is a personal choice and can be valid. However, using the absence of oral sex as leverage or a punishment could be seen as bargaining with sex, which the boyfriend accused her of. That's a common criticism in relationships when one person withholds intimacy to get their way. \n\nBut wait, the author is doing this because of her own physical discomfort, not just to get something from him. She's trying to address a problem that affects her experience. The boyfriend's reaction, accusing her of bargaining and being withholding, might be dismissive of her genuine issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's insistence on her body hair maintenance might contribute to the problem. If he's not maintaining his own body hair, it's inconsistent. The author is trying to solve a problem caused by his lack of grooming. \n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Withholding oral sex could be seen as a form of using sex as a weapon, but if it's a personal boundary due to physical discomfort, it's a legitimate choice. The boyfriend's response of being dismissive and not addressing the root issue (his own grooming) is problematic. \n\nSo, who's the asshole here? The author is standing up for her own comfort, which is valid. The boyfriend isn't taking her concerns seriously. The issue might stem from communication problems rather than either being entirely in the wrong. However, the question is specifically about the author. \n\nIf the author is using the absence of oral sex as a punishment to make him trim his hair, that could be in the wrong. But if she's simply stating her boundary because it's affecting her enjoyment, then it's her right. The line between setting a boundary and using sex as leverage can be blurry. \n\nIn many relationship advice contexts, it's considered healthy to communicate needs and set boundaries. However, using the withholding of pleasure as a way to get the other person to change might not be ideal. The author's approach might be seen as a problem if it's about control rather than genuine need. \n\nBut given her explanation, it's more about personal discomfort. The boyfriend's reaction is also problematic. So, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. However, there's a nuance here. If she's using it as a way to force him to change, that's different. If she's just expressing her preference and he's not respecting that, then he's the one in the wrong. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the author's action is a boundary or manipulation. Since she's trying to solve a problem that he's contributed to (by not grooming), it's more about mutual respect and communication. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
