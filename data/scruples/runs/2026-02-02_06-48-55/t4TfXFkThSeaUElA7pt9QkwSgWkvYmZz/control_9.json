(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend who's not happy with the author's decision to stop giving oral sex because of his body hair. The author says he's otherwise caring but has strong opinions about her hair but not his own. She had an incident where she got hairs in her mouth and decided to set a boundary, but he's upset and accused her of withholding sex.\n\nHmm. So the main issue is about personal preferences in intimacy. The author is setting a boundary based on her comfort, which seems reasonable. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is not happy with that. The question is whether she's in the wrong for doing so.\n\nFirst, boundaries in relationships are important. If something is uncomfortable, people have the right to say no. The author has tried to communicate her issue and asked him to trim his hair, which he didn't do. So her decision to stop oral sex is a boundary she's enforcing for her own well-being. That's not inherently wrong.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's reaction is problematic. He accused her of bargaining with sex, which can be a red flag. If he's okay with going down on her but she's not okay with oral due to his appearance, that's about mutual respect. His response of calling her withholding might not address her valid concern. \n\nBut wait, is there a cultural or social norm here? Some might think that oral sex is something expected in a relationship, but it's actually a personal choice. The author is within her rights to refuse if it makes her uncomfortable. The key here is whether the boyfriend is being reasonable. He's not addressing her concern (trimming hair) and instead is retaliating, which isn't healthy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. The boyfriend's issue lies in his reaction and not respecting her comfort. The answer should be B (No).\n"
