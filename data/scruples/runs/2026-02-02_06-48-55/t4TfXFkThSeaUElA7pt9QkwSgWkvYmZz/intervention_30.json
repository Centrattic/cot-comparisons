(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who's upset because his partner is cutting off oral sex due to his pubic hair. The author of the post is the one who set this condition.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend has a lot of body hair and is particular about the author's hair, but not his own. The author prefers to be clean-shaven, which aligns with his preferences. The main issue is that the boyfriend's hair causes discomfort during oral sex, leading the author to refuse unless he trims it. The boyfriend felt accused and retaliated by saying he's willing to continue other activities, which the author finds unfair.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author tried to express her feelings and set a boundary, which is her right. She's not withholding sex but setting a condition for a specific act. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her withholding and bargaining with sex seems like a poor response. He's not addressing the actual issue but rather being defensive.\n\nHowever, the author is making a demand that might be seen as using a sexual act as a bargaining chip. Some might argue that using oral sex as a condition for other things is manipulative. But in this case, it's a personal preference about physical comfort. It's about her own comfort and consent; she's not forcing him to do anything but to trim his hair to make an activity more comfortable for her.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's response is dismissive and possibly hurtful. He's not considering her valid concern and instead frames it as a negotiation. His behavior could be seen as disrespectful. The author's ultimatum might be seen as extreme, but it's a boundary she feels is necessary for her own enjoyment and comfort.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. If using a sexual act as a condition is considered wrong, then maybe A. But if personal boundaries and comfort are valid, then B. The boyfriend's reaction is problematic, but the author's action is a personal choice based on her comfort. The key here is mutual respect and communication. The author isn't wrong for setting a boundary, but maybe the way she communicated it could be improved. However, the main issue is his reaction, not her setting the boundary. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
