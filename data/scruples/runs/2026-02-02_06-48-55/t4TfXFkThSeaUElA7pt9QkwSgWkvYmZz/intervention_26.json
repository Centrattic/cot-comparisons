(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question (AITA = Am I the Asshole) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author cutting off oral sex from her boyfriend because of his pubic hair.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author explains that her boyfriend is otherwise kind and caring, but he's not trim his pubic hair, which she finds problematic. She tried to communicate her issue with him, but he reacted negatively, even calling her withholding and bargaining with sex. The last straw was when she found pubic hairs in her mouth, leading her to set a boundary about oral sex unless he trims his hair. Now she's being accused of being the problem, and she's unsure if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal boundaries, communication, and mutual respect in a relationship. The author has a specific issue that's affecting her comfort and enjoyment during intimacy. She tried to address it, but the boyfriend didn't take it seriously and even turned it into a criticism against her. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to respect each other's boundaries and preferences. If one person is uncomfortable with something, especially in intimate contexts, it's reasonable for them to express that and seek a solution. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might not see his body hair as an issue, but that doesn't mean the author has to ignore her own comfort. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems dismissive and even a bit manipulative by suggesting she's bargaining with sex. That's not healthy communication. The author setting a boundary by saying she won't perform oral sex unless he trims his hair is a way to protect her own well-being. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. Some might argue that body hair is personal choice and the author shouldn't impose her standards on his body. But if it's causing distress and affecting their intimacy, then it's a valid concern. The boyfriend's lack of willingness to accommodate her request could also be seen as not respecting her feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't the asshole here. She's standing up for her own comfort and trying to address an issue that's affecting their sexual relationship. The boyfriend's response was unhelpful and dismissive, which is more indicative of his behavior being the problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
