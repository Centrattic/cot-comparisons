(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe user is asking if cutting off their boyfriend from oral sex because of his pubic hair makes them the asshole. The boyfriend is described as kind and caring otherwise. His main issue is about the author's body hair, but he's not happy with his own. The author is bothered by his unruly hair, especially when it gets caught in her teeth during oral sex, leading her to set an ultimatum. He responded by accusing her of being withholding and even used a counter-argument about being the better person because he still goes down on her.\n\nFirst, the author's concern is valid because physical discomfort during intimacy can affect the experience. The boyfriend's lack of attention to his own grooming, specifically the pubic hair, is an issue she's facing. She's not the one with the issue in terms of grooming; she's clean-shaven, which he insists on. So, her request to trim his hair for better oral sex is reasonable. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems a bit off. He accused her of bargaining with sex and even bragged about still performing for her. That's a bit manipulative and dismissive of her legitimate concern. He's not addressing her problem but instead deflecting blame. \n\nThe ultimatum part is a bit tricky. While it's her right to set boundaries, the way he reacted might indicate that communication isn't happening effectively. However, the act of cutting off oral sex as a consequence is a personal choice, and if it's causing her discomfort, it's within her right to set that boundary. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, she's not being unreasonable. The problem is mutual grooming expectations. He's not meeting her preference, and she's addressing it. The boyfriend's response is more concerning because he's not respecting her comfort. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the issue is more on the boyfriend for not being open to trimming his hair and responding defensively. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
