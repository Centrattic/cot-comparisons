(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who's not happy with the author's decision to cut off oral sex because of his body hair, particularly pubic hair. The author mentions that the boyfriend is otherwise loving and caring but has strong opinions about her body hair, which she trims or shaves because she likes being clean. However, she's uncomfortable with his hair getting in her mouth during oral, leading to the ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a valid concern about personal preference and comfort. Body hair can be a sensitive issue, and each person has different standards. She's not in the wrong for having her own boundaries, especially if it's affecting her enjoyment of intimacy. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that his grooming habits are being criticized, which could hurt his feelings, especially if he's not used to such feedback.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author communicated her discomfort clearly, and while the boyfriend's reaction might have been defensive, his response about still being willing to reciprocate could be a misunderstanding. The author's demand for him to trim his hair is her way of maintaining her comfort in the relationship. It's important to note that there's no one-size-fits-all in relationships, and personal preferences, even if they seem trivial, are significant when it comes to intimacy.\n\nThe boyfriend's accusation that she's withholding sex in a bargaining way might be an overreaction. Ultimatums can be a heavy approach, but if she's honest about her discomfort, it's part of setting boundaries. Whether this is fair depends on their communication style and mutual respect. Since the author is not the one being judgmental about his beard or other hair, just the pubic hair, and it's causing her distress, her stance seems reasonable. The boyfriend should be open to adjusting his grooming habits if it's a dealbreaker for her. However, if he refuses and they can't find a compromise, it might indicate a deeper issue. \n\nIn the end, whether the author is in the wrong isn't clear-cut. It's about respecting each other's preferences and working together. Since she's made her feelings known and the issue is affecting her, she has a right to set that boundary. The boyfriend's defensiveness and the way he framed her request as a form of bargaining could be where he's wrong. But the act of setting a boundary isn't inherently wrong. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
