(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author cutting off oral sex with her boyfriend because he has a lot of body hair, particularly pubic hair, which she finds unappealing. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that her boyfriend is otherwise loving and caring, but he's not particular about his body hair. She, on the other hand, likes to be clean-shaven and he insists she trims or shaves. However, she's uncomfortable with his hairy pubic area, to the point of gagging on a hair during oral sex. She set a boundary that he needs to trim it or she won't perform oral. He responded by accusing her of withholding sex and bargaining, even though he's willing to go down on her despite her being \"perfect\" down there.\n\nThe key here is about personal boundaries and mutual respect in a relationship. The author is expressing a legitimate discomfort with her partner's body hair, which affects her enjoyment and comfort during intimacy. Setting a boundary is a common way to address such issues. The boyfriend's reaction might be seen as dismissive of her feelings, as he's not addressing her discomfort and instead focusing on the act of sex itself. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to communicate her needs, but her partner didn't take it seriously, leading to conflict. The question is whether her decision to stop oral sex is a reasonable boundary. Since the author isn't engaging in harmful behavior and is trying to express her needs, it's more about respecting her boundaries. The boyfriend's refusal to adjust his grooming habits despite her clear request might make him the one being unreasonable here. \n\nThe argument could be made that using sex as leverage is problematic, but in this case, the author is not withholding all sex but a specific act (oral) due to a specific reason. If both partners are willing to meet each other's needs in other ways, that's part of a healthy relationship. However, the boyfriend's insistence on his own grooming preferences without considering her comfort seems to be the issue. \n\nSo, based on this analysis, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her boundaries, and the boyfriend's reaction is what's problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
