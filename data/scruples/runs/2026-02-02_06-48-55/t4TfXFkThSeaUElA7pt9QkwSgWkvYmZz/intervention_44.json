(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author cutting off oral sex with her boyfriend because of his body hair, specifically pubic hair. The boyfriend is described as caring and generous but has strong opinions about her hair, while he's less concerned about his own. The last straw was when she found pubic hairs in her mouth, leading her to set a boundary. He responded by accusing her of withholding sex and using it as a bargaining chip, while he's still willing to perform oral on her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is setting a boundary for her comfort, which is her right. She's not obligated to perform sexual acts if it makes her uncomfortable. However, she's using a reciprocal action (stopping oral) to make him change his behavior, which could be seen as using sex as a bargaining chip. On the other hand, the boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries by not trimming his hair and then criticizes her for withholding sex. \n\nThe key here is consent and mutual respect. If the author is uncomfortable, she has the right to express that. However, the method she uses to enforce her boundary (withholding oral sex) might be seen as a form of punishment or leverage, which could be problematic. It's important to communicate needs without using reciprocal withholding unless both parties agree. The boyfriend's response accuses her of bargaining, which might indicate that he feels pressured or that the dynamic is unequal. \n\nIn terms of who's the asshole, it's possible that both have valid points. The author is within her rights to set a boundary, but using the withholding of a sexual act as a demand could be seen as immature or manipulative. The boyfriend not respecting her grooming preferences and then reacting defensively also plays a role. However, since the author is the one actively making a choice to stop oral sex as a consequence, she might be in the wrong if that's considered coercive. Alternatively, if the boyfriend isn't meeting her needs, she's justified in seeking a resolution. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because she's using a sexual act as leverage to change his behavior, which can create an unhealthy dynamic. However, there's nuance here because she's also expressing discomfort. The correct approach would be to communicate her needs and perhaps seek a compromise rather than using reciprocal withholding. So, the answer would be A.\n"
