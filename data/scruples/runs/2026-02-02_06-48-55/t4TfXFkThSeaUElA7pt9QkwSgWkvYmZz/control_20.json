(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off oral sex because her boyfriend's pubic hair is causing her discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's boyfriend is described as loving and caring but has a weird obsession with her body hair. He's not particular about his own hair but insists she keeps hers trimmed. The author, who prefers being clean-shaven, faces a problem with his hairy area during oral sex, leading to gagging and discomfort. She gave him an ultimatum: trim or no oral. He responded by accusing her of withholding and using sex as leverage, even though he's willing to perform oral on her.\n\nNow, considering personal preferences and boundaries. Both partners have the right to set boundaries based on their comfort. The author's issue is valid because the hair is causing her physical discomfort. She's communicated her needs, which is a healthy step. However, using the withdrawal of a sexual act as a form of leverage can be seen as a bargaining tactic, which some might view as manipulative. But in this context, she's setting a personal boundary, not necessarily bargaining. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also a factor. He's not addressing her legitimate concern and instead shifts the blame, calling her withholding. His argument that he's willing to perform oral on her might be a way to deflect from his own grooming habits. The key here is mutual respect and willingness to compromise. If he's unwilling to adjust his grooming to meet her comfort level, there's a lack of effort on his part. \n\nBut does setting a boundary make the author in the wrong? It depends on the context of their relationship. If they've discussed this before and he's been uncooperative, her stance is justified. However, using a sexual act as a condition might be seen as using sex for leverage, which can be problematic. But again, if it's a personal comfort issue, it's about mutual respect and communication. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should accommodate each other's preferences when possible. His refusal to trim despite her clear discomfort might make him the one in the wrong. The author is asserting her needs, which is healthy. So the answer leans towards B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
