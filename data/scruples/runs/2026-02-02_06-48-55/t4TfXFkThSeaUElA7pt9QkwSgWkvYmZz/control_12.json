(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who's not happy with the author's decision to cut off oral sex due to his pubic hair. The author explains that she finds his hair unappealing and it's affecting her comfort during intimacy. She gave him an ultimatum, and he responded by accusing her, which led to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a valid concern about her comfort and physical reaction. She's not in the wrong for expressing her boundaries, especially if it's causing her distress. However, using sex as an ultimatum can be seen as a form of bargaining, which some might view as manipulative. But in this case, she's setting a boundary for her own well-being, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has his own preferences and is willing to accommodate hers, but she's not reciprocating his willingness to take care of her. The key here is mutual respect and communication. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing her comfort, but maybe a better approach would be to find a compromise rather than an ultimatum. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. Since her actions stem from personal comfort and she's communicating her needs, she's not the asshole here. The answer should be B.\n"
