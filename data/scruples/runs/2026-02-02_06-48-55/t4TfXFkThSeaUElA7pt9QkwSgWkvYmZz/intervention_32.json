(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a boyfriend who's not happy with the author's body hair and wants her to trim or shave, but she's cutting off oral because she's not comfortable with his body hair. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that her boyfriend is generally kind and caring, but he's very particular about her body hair. He wants her to be clean-shaven, which she's okay with since she likes being clean too. However, the issue arises with his own body hair. She's given multiple instances where his pubic hair is causing her discomfort during oral sex, like catching hairs in her teeth. The last time was really bad, leading her to set a boundary: he needs to trim or she won't give oral. He responded by accusing her of withholding sex and bargaining, even though he's willing to perform oral on her.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author has a legitimate reason for her discomfort. Oral sex is a personal choice, and if something is physically uncomfortable or revolting to her, that's a valid concern. However, the way she's handling it might be part of the issue. She's using oral sex as a bargaining chip, which could be seen as coercive. But on the other hand, she's setting a boundary based on her personal comfort.\n\nHer boyfriend's response is problematic too. He's calling her withholding and not respecting his efforts, but he's not addressing her legitimate issue. He's also not considering her feelings about his grooming habits, even though he's not bothered by his own. The dynamic here is about mutual respect. If he's okay with his own body hair but she's not, and she's communicating that clearly, it's reasonable for her to ask for a solution. However, using oral sex as a condition might be seen as using sex as a tool for negotiation, which isn't healthy.\n\nAlternatively, the author could have discussed non-sexual terms first, like agreeing to trim his hair for her comfort, rather than making it a condition for her to perform oral. But in the end, she's not in the wrong for expressing her discomfort. The boyfriend's response is more problematic, as he's dismissing her feelings and not addressing her issue. So maybe the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
