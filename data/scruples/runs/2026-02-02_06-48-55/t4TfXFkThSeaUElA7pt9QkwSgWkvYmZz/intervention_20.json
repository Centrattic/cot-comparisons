(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend who's upset because the author is cutting him off from oral sex due to his pubic hair. The author says her boyfriend is otherwise caring but has strong opinions about her body hair, which she manages, but he doesn't trim his own enough. She had an incident where she felt hairs in her mouth and set a boundary, but he reacted negatively by accusing her of using sex as leverage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is setting a personal boundary about something that's affecting her comfort during intimacy. Physical preferences and hygiene can be personal, and if something is causing distress, it's reasonable to communicate that. On the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that his preferences are being disregarded or that he's being judged for his body hair, which could be a sensitive issue for him.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author tried to communicate her issue, and the boyfriend's response was to accuse her of bargaining with sex, which could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Setting a boundary isn't inherently wrong, especially regarding one's own comfort. However, there might be a better way to approach it without an ultimatum, like discussing it without linking it directly to sexual acts, perhaps focusing on his grooming habits as a mutual health issue or a preference to be discussed openly.\n\nBut the author's action was a direct consequence of her discomfort and a way to enforce her preference. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about feeling accused rather than addressing her genuine issue. In relationships, both partners have the right to express their needs and preferences. If the author feels that the hair is unsanitary or uncomfortable, and she's communicated that, then her decision to set a boundary isn't necessarily wrong. However, the ultimatum might have been a harsh response. Maybe a more collaborative approach would have been better, but the core issue is about her right to her own comfort.\n\nThe boyfriend's accusation that she's withholding sex is also problematic because it implies that her request is manipulative, rather than a genuine need. So, the author's stance is about her own well-being and comfort, which isn't unreasonable. Therefore, the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
