(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about their boyfriend's body hair, specifically his pubic hair, causing issues during oral sex. The author says they can't handle the hair and set a boundary, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accused them of being withholding. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is clean-shaven and their boyfriend is not, which is causing discomfort during oral sex. They had a specific incident where they found pubic hairs in their mouth, which was a turning point. They set a boundary, but the boyfriend reacted negatively, leading to conflict. The author is seeking validation on whether they're wrong for doing this.\n\nBody autonomy and personal preferences are important in relationships. It's common for people to have preferences about body hair, and communication is key. The author tried to communicate their discomfort and set a boundary. The boyfriend's response of accusing them of withholding sex and bargaining might be an issue. However, setting boundaries isn't inherently wrong. The question is whether the author's action is reasonable.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for having a preference or for setting a boundary that affects their comfort. Relationships require mutual respect and accommodation of each other's needs. If the boyfriend is unwilling to adjust his grooming habits, that might be his issue. However, the author's ultimatum is a boundary, which is their right. The problem might be communication or compromise, but the act of setting the boundary isn't wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). Their actions are about their comfort and communication, which are valid in a relationship.\n"
