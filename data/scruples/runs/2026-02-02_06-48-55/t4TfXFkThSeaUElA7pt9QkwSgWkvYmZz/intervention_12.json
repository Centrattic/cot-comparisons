(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the boyfriend has a lot of body hair, especially in the pubic area. The author, the girlfriend, is cutting off oral sex because she's uncomfortable with the hair. She mentions that he's generally kind and caring but has strong opinions about her hair. She's now giving an ultimatum that he needs to trim his hair or she won't perform oral sex anymore. He responds by accusing her of being withholding and using sex as a bargaining tool.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The author's main issue is about personal preference regarding body hair. She finds his hairiness uncomfortable during intimacy. On the other hand, the boyfriend is upset that she's making a condition for oral sex, which he sees as unfair since he's willing to reciprocate. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author is expressing her boundaries, which is valid. However, the way she's enforcing it (with an ultimatum) might be seen as manipulative if it's about control. Alternatively, she's setting a boundary for her comfort. The boyfriend's response about still performing oral sex while she's \"withholding\" it could imply that he's okay with his own preferences but not respecting hers. \n\nIn relationships, both partners have preferences, and it's about finding a middle ground. The author is trying to communicate her needs, which is healthy. The boyfriend might need to be more considerate of her feelings. However, using sex as a form of negotiation can be problematic. The question is whether the author is overstepping by making oral sex conditional. \n\nIf the author's request is reasonable (trimming hair for her comfort) and the boyfriend is unwilling to accommodate unless she reciprocates, that could be the issue. But if she's using oral sex as leverage when he's already willing to reciprocate, that might be where she's wrong. The problem here is mutual respect and compromise. \n\nIn many cases, personal preferences about body hair are subjective. The author's discomfort is valid, but the ultimatum might be seen as extreme. The boyfriend's reaction is also problematic because he's using her decision as a bargaining chip. However, the core issue is about mutual understanding. \n\nIt's possible that the author is in the right by setting a boundary, but the method could be better handled with more dialogue. Conversely, if the boyfriend is also making conditions for his own actions, it's a two-way street. The key is whether the author's demand is reasonable. Since the boyfriend is the one causing her discomfort, her request for him to trim might be fair. However, making oral sex conditional could be seen as using intimacy as leverage, which might be where she's in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if both partners have equal say in their intimate preferences, the author's stance isn't necessarily wrong. It's a matter of perspective. If she's comfortable setting boundaries and he's not willing to adjust, that's a conflict in communication. The answer hinges on whether using sex as a condition is acceptable. In healthy relationships, intimacy should be mutual and respectful, but it's not a transaction. The author might be overreacting by making it an ultimatum, but her discomfort is real. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the author is not entirely in the wrong because she's setting a boundary for her comfort. However, the way she's enforcing it could be seen as manipulative. The boyfriend's response also isn't helpful. But since the core issue is his grooming affecting her experience, her stance is more about her needs than control. So, Answer B (not in the wrong) might be more accurate.\n"
