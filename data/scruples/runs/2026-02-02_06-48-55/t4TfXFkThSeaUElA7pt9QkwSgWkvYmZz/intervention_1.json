(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author cutting off oral sex from her boyfriend because he has a lot of pubic hair, which she finds unappealing and uncomfortable. She mentions that he's otherwise a good partner but has specific opinions about her body hair, yet his own hair is causing issues.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author approached the issue by giving an ultimatum, which might be a problem. Instead of discussing her discomfort earlier, she waited until it became a deal-breaker. That could be seen as withholding affection without prior discussion, which might be the issue here.\n\nOn the other hand, her discomfort is valid. Physical preferences are personal, and it's reasonable for her to have boundaries. However, cutting off intimacy abruptly without addressing it calmly might have caused the conflict. The boyfriend's response, accusing her of bargaining with sex, also shows a lack of understanding. \n\nThe author's actions were to set a boundary, which is her right. But the way she did it\u2014imposing a sudden cutoff\u2014might not have been the best approach. The boyfriend's reaction was also poor, as he dismissed her feelings. Both sides have some responsibility here. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's standing up for her own comfort, which is a personal choice, and the boyfriend's response was dismissive, the main fault might lie with him. The author's action, while abrupt, stems from her legitimate discomfort. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a better angle.\n"
