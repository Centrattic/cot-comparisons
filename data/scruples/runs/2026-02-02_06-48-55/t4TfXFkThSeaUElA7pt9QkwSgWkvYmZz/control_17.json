(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author, a woman, is cutting off oral sex from her boyfriend because she's uncomfortable with his pubic hair. The boyfriend isn't happy with this, saying she's withholding sex and he's still willing to perform oral on her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has a valid reason for her discomfort\u2014she's not happy with the pubic hair and it's affecting their intimacy. She communicated her needs, which is important. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about how he's being nice by going down on her while she's not reciprocating. That seems a bit unfair because everyone has preferences and boundaries. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for having her own standards. The issue is about mutual respect and communication. If she's communicated her needs and he's not addressing them, it's his responsibility to adjust. However, if the boyfriend is still okay with her standards (like her being clean-shaven), but she's not okay with his, that's where the conflict lies. \n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and mutual respect. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The boyfriend might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries and for his reaction. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
