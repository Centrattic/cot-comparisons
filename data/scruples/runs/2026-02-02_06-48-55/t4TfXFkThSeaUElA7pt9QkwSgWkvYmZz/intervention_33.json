(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who's not happy with his partner's body hair and is cutting off oral sex unless he trims it. The boyfriend is described as kind and caring, but has strong opinions about her body hair. The author is upset because when giving oral, she caught pubic hairs in her teeth, which made her gag. She told him she can't do oral unless he trims, and he accused her of withholding sex. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, first, the author is the one setting a boundary here. She has a legitimate health/safety concern since getting hair in her teeth could be unpleasant or even a choking hazard. She's trying to communicate that she's uncomfortable with his body hair during oral sex. On the other hand, the boyfriend is accused of being insistent about her shaving, which might be body-shaming. But he's also saying he's willing to continue the relationship without her withholding sex from him, which he sees as her bargaining with it.\n\nThe key points are about mutual respect and communication. The author is asserting her needs, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about control or feeling criticized, but he's not addressing her actual concern. If a person is uncomfortable with a partner's body hair, it's within their right to express that, especially if it's affecting their comfort or health. The boyfriend's response of calling her withholding and using it as a bargaining chip is problematic because it's about power dynamics.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author did set a boundary, which is okay, but the way she's doing it (cutting off oral entirely) might be seen as an ultimatum. But considering the health aspect, it's a valid boundary. The boyfriend's response of accusing her of bargaining with sex is more about control. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary; the boyfriend is in the wrong for his reaction. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
