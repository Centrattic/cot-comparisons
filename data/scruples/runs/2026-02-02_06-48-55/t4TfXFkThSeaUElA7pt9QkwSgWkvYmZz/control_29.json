(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who's not happy with the author's decision to stop giving him oral sex because of his body hair. The author feels that his hair is causing issues, especially during oral sex, and set a boundary. The boyfriend accused her of withholding sex and bargaining, which she finds unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author made a personal decision based on her comfort. Body hair preferences are subjective. If the author finds his hair unpleasant and it's affecting her experience, it's her right to set boundaries. The boyfriend's reaction seems dismissive of her feelings. He's being defensive, which isn't healthy. Communication is key in relationships, and if he's not willing to address her concerns (like trimming), then maybe she's justified in her stance.\n\nBut wait, is the author overreacting? Some might say body hair is a personal choice and he should have his own grooming habits. However, the author is clear that she's not against his hair in general but the practical issue during intimacy. The fact that he accuses her of bargaining with sex could be a manipulation tactic, which is a red flag. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's expressing her needs. The boyfriend's response is more about deflection than solving the problem.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's setting a boundary for a valid personal reason. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, not the author's decision.\n"
