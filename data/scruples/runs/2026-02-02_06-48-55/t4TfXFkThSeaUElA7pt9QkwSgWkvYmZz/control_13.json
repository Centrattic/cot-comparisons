(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a relationship where the boyfriend is not happy with the author's body hair and insists she trims or shaves, but the author is okay with that. However, the author is cutting off oral because of his body hair, specifically pubic hair, which she finds unappealing. The key points here are mutual expectations and communication.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is described as loving and caring but has strong opinions about the author's body hair. The author complies because she likes being clean. Then, when it comes to her giving him oral, his pubic hair is an issue for her, leading to her setting a boundary. The boyfriend reacted by accusing her of withholding and using sex as bargaining, which might be a red flag if he's being controlling. \n\nThe author is taking a stand for her own comfort, which is valid. People have different preferences and boundaries in relationships. It's about mutual respect. If the boyfriend can't respect her boundaries, that's a problem on his end. The author isn't being unreasonable here; she's communicating her needs. The boyfriend's response seems dismissive of her feelings. So, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her right to have her preferences respected, which is important in a healthy relationship. The answer should be B.\n"
