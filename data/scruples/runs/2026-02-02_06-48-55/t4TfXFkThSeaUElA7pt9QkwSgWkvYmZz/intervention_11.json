(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who's not trimming his pubic hair, which is causing discomfort for the author during oral sex. The author decided to cut off oral until he trims it, and the boyfriend accused her of being withholding. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author has a valid issue with the hair causing a gagging feeling. That's a physical reaction, which is legitimate. The boyfriend isn't shaving as per her preference, and she's clearly communicated her discomfort. Setting boundaries around intimacy is important. She's not asking for a huge change, just trimming, which is reasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is a kind, caring person. He's not forcing her to do anything; she's the one choosing to give oral. But the problem is that his hair is causing her distress. She tried to communicate, and when he didn't comply, she took a stand. He then accused her of bargaining with sex, which seems like a deflection. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect and communication. The author is asserting her comfort level, which is her right. The boyfriend's response was dismissive. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but it seems like she's standing up for herself. So, the answer is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
