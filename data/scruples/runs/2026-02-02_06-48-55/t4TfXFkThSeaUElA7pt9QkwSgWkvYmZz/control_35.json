(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off oral sex with her boyfriend because of his body hair. The situation is a bit personal, so I need to be careful here.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that her boyfriend is otherwise loving and caring. But he's particular about her body hair, which she trims or shaves. However, when it comes to him, she finds his pubic hair bothersome, especially during oral sex. The last incident was when she found hair in her mouth, which made her gag. She set a boundary that he needs to trim it or she can't do oral anymore. He accused her of withholding sex and being unfair because he does it for her.\n\nSo, the main points here are about mutual respect and boundaries in a relationship. The boyfriend isn't wrong for having preferences about her hair, but the author is setting a boundary for her comfort. It's about bodily autonomy and what each person is comfortable with. The boyfriend's reaction seems dismissive of her feelings, which isn't healthy. Setting limits in intimacy is normal, so the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's accusation that she's bargaining with sex is also problematic. They need to communicate better and find a solution that works for both. The author isn't being unreasonable here. So the answer should be B.\n"
