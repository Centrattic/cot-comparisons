(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who's not happy with the author's body hair, but the author is cutting him off from oral sex because of his pubic hair. The author feels that his hair is causing issues, like clumps getting caught in her teeth, and she's set a boundary that he needs to trim it or there's no oral sex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend is described as loving and caring otherwise, but he has strong opinions about the author's body hair. He wants her to trim or shave, which she's okay with since she likes being clean. But the problem arises with his own hair. The author is upset about the hair during oral sex, leading to a conflict. \n\nThe author's main issue is the physical discomfort from his pubic hair. She's given him a clear boundary, which he didn't take well, leading to an argument where he accused her of using sex as leverage. The key points here are consent, communication, and mutual respect.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to communicate their needs and boundaries. The author has a legitimate concern about her comfort during intimacy. Setting a boundary around something that affects her physical experience isn't unreasonable. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction\u2014accusing her of withholding sex and not respecting his efforts\u2014might indicate a problem with how he handles conflict or his own insecurities.\n\nHowever, cutting off oral sex entirely could be seen as using a sexual act as a bargaining chip, which might be problematic. But in this case, the author is rejecting something that causes her discomfort, which is her right. The boyfriend's refusal to meet her halfway (trimming his hair) and his defensive response might be more at fault here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she's setting a boundary based on her comfort, that's valid. But if she's using it to control or manipulate, that's different. The story suggests she's trying to find a solution (he needs to trim), but he's not cooperating. The boyfriend's behavior of accusing her of bargaining with sex is more concerning. \n\nSo, considering mutual respect and the right to set personal boundaries, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction and unwillingness to address the issue might be the bigger problem. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
