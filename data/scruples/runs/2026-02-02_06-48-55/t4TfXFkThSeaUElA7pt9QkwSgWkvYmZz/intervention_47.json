(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman who's cutting off oral sex from her boyfriend because of his body hair, specifically pubic hair. She says he's weird about her body hair, but she likes to be clean. She's given him an ultimatum to trim his hair or no oral sex. He accused her of being withholding and bargaining with sex. She feels it's juvenile but can't help it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate issue with the hair causing her discomfort, like hairs getting caught in her teeth. That's a real problem. But she's using oral sex as a bargaining chip, which could be seen as using sex as punishment or control. On the other hand, the boyfriend is accused of not addressing his own grooming habits and being insistent on hers. He's also a kind person otherwise.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, using oral sex as a way to enforce grooming might be manipulative. However, her discomfort is valid. The key here is whether her actions are reasonable. If she's communicating her needs and the boyfriend isn't listening, maybe she's justified. But if she's using sex as a threat, that's a problem. Also, the BF's response of calling her withholding and using that as a counterpoint\u2014does that make him right?\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the BF isn't addressing her concerns and she's taking a stand, maybe she's not wrong. But using oral sex as a punishment could be seen as wrong. However, the alternative is that she's setting boundaries for her comfort. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's asserting her needs, even if the method is a bit extreme. The BF should listen to her discomfort, and she's within her rights to set those boundaries. So the answer is B.\n"
