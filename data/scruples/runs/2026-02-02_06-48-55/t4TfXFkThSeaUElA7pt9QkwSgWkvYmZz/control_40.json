(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple where the boyfriend is okay with the author being clean-shaven but is himself hairy, especially in the pubic area. The author is uncomfortable with his hair during oral sex, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The boyfriend is described as kind and caring, but he's insistent on the author maintaining a certain grooming standard. However, when the author pushes back about his own hygiene (pubic hair causing discomfort), he reacts defensively, accusing her of withholding sex. The key issue here is mutual respect and communication in the relationship.\n\nThe author's stance is about her personal comfort and health. Hair in the mouth during oral sex can be unpleasant or even cause gagging, which is a valid concern. The boyfriend's response of blaming her and using sex as leverage seems manipulative and dismissive of her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, both partners have the right to express their needs and boundaries. The author isn't being unreasonable by setting a limit based on her comfort. The boyfriend's reaction, on the other hand, seems to undermine her valid concern. \n\nThe question is about who's at fault. The author is standing up for herself, which is reasonable. The boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries and is using emotional manipulation. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
