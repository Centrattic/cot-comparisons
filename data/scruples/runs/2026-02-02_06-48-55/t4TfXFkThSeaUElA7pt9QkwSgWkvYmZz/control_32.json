(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves her boyfriend's body hair and her decision to stop giving him oral because of it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that her boyfriend is generally kind and caring but has strong opinions about her body hair, while he's not as concerned about his own. She's comfortable with her own grooming but finds his pubic hair messy during oral sex, leading to a gagging incident. She set a boundary, and he reacted by accusing her of using sex as a bargaining tool.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent and mutual respect in a relationship. She's setting a personal boundary because of her physical discomfort, which is a valid reason. On the other hand, he's not happy with her ultimatum and is making it about her being withholding. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She tried to express her discomfort, and he didn't validate her feelings. Instead, he turned it into a criticism of her. Setting boundaries around sexual activity is normal, and it's not wrong for her to prioritize her comfort. However, the way she's cutting off all oral sex might be seen as an ultimatum, which could be a point of contention. \n\nBut considering that she's been asking him to trim, and he hasn't complied, leading to a specific incident that made her uncomfortable, her action seems like self-respect. The boyfriend's reaction of accusing her of withholding sex when it's about his own grooming choice might place more responsibility on him for not respecting her needs. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary due to her discomfort. The boyfriend's response is more problematic because he's not respecting her boundary. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
