(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend cutting off oral sex because her boyfriend's pubic hair is bothering her. She's given ultimatums, and he's upset, saying she's withholding sex. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has legitimate concerns about being uncomfortable during oral sex due to the hair. It's understandable that hair getting caught in her teeth would be unpleasant and affect the mood. However, the way she's handling it by cutting off oral without addressing the issue might be problematic. Communication is key in relationships. Instead of an ultimatum, maybe discussing her feelings and suggesting trimming could have been a better approach. \n\nThe boyfriend's response of accusing her of bargaining with sex might be a deflection. But if he's not willing to adjust, then her stance has some validity. The author's actions are a form of sexual withholding, which can be a sensitive topic. In some contexts, using sex as a bargaining chip can be seen as manipulative, but if it's about personal comfort and consent is a factor, it's more about boundaries. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's action is a reasonable boundary or a form of manipulation. Since she's expressing a genuine discomfort and setting a boundary for her own well-being, it's not necessarily wrong. However, the method of cutting off oral without prior discussion could be improved. The boyfriend's reaction is also unhelpful, as he's not addressing her legitimate concern.\n\nIn terms of who is the \"asshole,\" it's possible both have some faults. The author could have communicated her needs more effectively, and the boyfriend could be more considerate of her comfort. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Given that she's setting a boundary based on her physical discomfort, I think she's justified. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no cultural or societal expectations influencing this. In many relationships, sexual boundaries are personal, and if both parties are consenting adults, the author isn't wrong for prioritizing her comfort.\n"
