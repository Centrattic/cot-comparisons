(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who's upset because the author cut off oral sex due to his pubic hair. The author feels that his body hair is too much and made her gag when she tried giving him oral. The boyfriend accused her of being withholding and bargaining with sex, but she feels it's justified because he's a mess there while she's clean.\n\nHmm, so the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's the case. First, I should consider the key points. The author is not okay with his body hair and has asked him to trim it, leading to cutting off oral sex. The boyfriend is not happy with that and the ultimatum.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to communicate her discomfort, and the boyfriend's response was defensive. He said he's the better person because he still goes down on her, implying that she's using sex as a bargaining tool. But the author's main issue is that his pubic hair is causing her physical discomfort and ruining the mood. She's not refusing all intimacy, just oral. \n\nIs it the author's fault for prioritizing her comfort? Body hair is a personal choice. If he's not interested in trimming, maybe he's not respecting her needs. On the other hand, using sex as a leverage can be problematic. But in this case, she's setting a boundary for her own comfort. The boyfriend's reaction seems dismissive. He's not addressing her valid concern but instead attacking her motives. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. She's advocating for her own comfort and tried to address it. The boyfriend isn't meeting her needs by not trimming if he's unwilling. The problem lies in his response to her request. Therefore, the author isn't wrong for setting that boundary. Answer B.\n"
