(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the boyfriend is being asked to trim his pubic hair because the author finds the existing length unacceptable during oral sex. The key points here are the author setting a boundary about their discomfort with the hair, leading to an ultimatum, and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author mentions the boyfriend is otherwise loving and caring but has specific preferences about body hair, especially in the author. However, the issue here is the boyfriend's pubic hair causing discomfort. The author has tried to communicate this, leading to a conflict where the boyfriend feels accused and the author is setting a boundary.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are crucial. The author is expressing a personal preference that affects their comfort during intimacy. Setting boundaries is a normal part of any relationship, especially regarding physical preferences. The boyfriend's response seems dismissive, as he accuses her of withholding sex and points out his own willingness to provide oral sex. This might indicate that he's not taking her feelings seriously.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's request is reasonable and based on their own comfort, then they aren't wrong. However, if they are being overly controlling or not considering the boyfriend's feelings, that could be an issue. But given the context, the author is voicing a legitimate concern that affects their intimacy. The boyfriend's reaction seems unhelpful, possibly leading to resentment.\n\nIt's also important to note that body hair is a personal choice and societal standards vary. The author isn't asking for a drastic change but a trim to make the experience more comfortable. The ultimatum is a way to enforce a boundary, which can be necessary if the issue is causing significant discomfort. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should be more flexible or find a solution that works for both, but in this case, the author's discomfort is affecting their enjoyment of the relationship. The boyfriend's insensitivity in his response might be the bigger issue here. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is likely not in the wrong. They are asserting their needs, which is a valid part of a healthy relationship. The boyfriend's reaction is the problem, not the author's request.\n"
