(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a woman who's having an issue with her boyfriend's body hair. She says he's otherwise kind and caring, but he's very particular about her body hair, making her trim or shave. However, he doesn't pay much attention to his own, leading to a lot of pubic hair. She loves giving him oral sex, but the hair is causing her discomfort, like getting hairs caught in her teeth. She told him she can't do oral anymore unless he trims, and he accused her of withholding sex and bargaining with it. She's wondering who's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I should consider both perspectives. The boyfriend is being specific about her body hair, which she complies with, but he neglects his own. She's now setting a boundary about his hair affecting her comfort during intimacy. He retaliates by saying he'll still go down on her, implying she's using sex as leverage. She argues that she's not the one being messy.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, communication is key. She tried to communicate her discomfort and set a boundary. It's reasonable for her to express that her partner's body hair is affecting her enjoyment. The boyfriend's reaction seems dismissive, as he's not addressing her valid concern and instead is focusing on his own actions. He claims she's withholding sex, but she's actually setting a boundary for her comfort, which is a legitimate reason. \n\nHer ultimatum might seem harsh, but if the hair is causing physical discomfort (like gagging), it's a health/safety issue. The boyfriend isn't respecting her needs here. The fact that he's still willing to perform oral but she can't reciprocate because of his hair shows a lack of mutual consideration. \n\nShe might need to approach this more gently, maybe discussing it without making it an ultimatum, but the core issue is her right to bodily autonomy and comfort. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries and is being defensive instead of empathetic. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
