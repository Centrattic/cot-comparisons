(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The main issue is about body hair preferences in their relationship.\n\nThe author's boyfriend doesn't care about his own body hair but is strict about her keeping hers clean. She likes to be clean-shaven, which they both agree on. But when it comes to his pubic hair, she finds it uncomfortable during oral sex, leading her to cut off oral contact. The last incident involved getting hairs caught in her teeth, which made her gag. He responded by accusing her of withholding sex and using it as a bargaining chip, while he's still willing to perform oral on her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is setting a boundary based on her comfort. Personal preferences about body hair are common, and it's reasonable for her to have a say in her own comfort during intimacy. However, she's using a sexual act as a condition for another, which could be seen as a form of negotiation or even a power dynamic. On the other hand, her partner's reaction seems dismissive and possibly judgmental, which is not ideal.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. The author is honest about her discomfort, and her request (for him to trim) is specific. If he's not willing to meet that, there's a mismatch in expectations. However, cutting off oral entirely might be a strong reaction. Maybe a compromise could be found, but the author's right to her boundary is important.\n\nThe partner's response is problematic because he's framing her request as withholding rather than valid. So, in this context, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting a boundary. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer would be B (No), because the author is within her rights to express her preferences and set limits in her relationship. However, perhaps she could approach the situation with more dialogue instead of ultimatums, but that's about improving the situation, not about being wrong.\n"
