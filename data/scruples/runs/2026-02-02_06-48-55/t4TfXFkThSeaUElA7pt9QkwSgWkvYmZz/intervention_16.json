(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple where the boyfriend is not happy with the author's decision to stop oral sex because of his pubic hair. The author feels that his hair is causing issues, leading to discomfort during oral sex, and set a boundary. The boyfriend reacted negatively, calling her withholding and using sex as a bargaining chip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is setting a boundary based on her physical comfort. It's her right to have preferences or boundaries in her sexual relationships. The boyfriend's response seems dismissive and possibly manipulative by bringing up the exchange of sex. The author isn't denying all intimacy but specifically one act that she's uncomfortable with. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend is described as otherwise kind and caring. But his reaction to her boundary might indicate a problem with communication or respect for her needs. The author's action is about her own comfort and health, so cutting off oral sex isn't necessarily wrong. The boyfriend's accusation of bargaining might be a deflection. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend could have addressed the issue earlier or been more understanding. The author isn't being unreasonable in her boundary. The key here is mutual respect and communication. If both parties can't find a middle ground, there might be deeper issues. But the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. So the answer is B.\n"
