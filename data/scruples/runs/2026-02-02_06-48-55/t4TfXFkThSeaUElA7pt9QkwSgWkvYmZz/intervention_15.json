(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The author is a woman who's cutting off oral sex with her boyfriend because he has a lot of pubic hair, which she finds unpleasant. The boyfriend is described as otherwise loving and caring, but he's insistent that she keeps her own hair trimmed while he's messy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is that his pubic hair is causing her discomfort, even gagging. She's given him ultimatums to trim it or she'll stop oral sex. He responded by accusing her of withholding sex and being manipulative, while he's still willing to perform oral on her.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author expressed her discomfort, which is valid. People have different preferences when it comes to intimacy, and there's nothing inherently wrong with having a preference for a certain body hair style. However, using sex as an ultimatum can be problematic. It might be seen as leveraging intimacy, which can create power imbalances in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction\u2014accusing her of bargaining with sex\u2014might be a deflection. Maybe he's uncomfortable with the request or doesn't see the issue. But he's also not addressing her valid concern about his hair causing discomfort. There's a balance between personal preferences and respecting each other's boundaries.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If she's using oral sex as a bargaining chip, that could be seen as manipulative. However, if she's setting a boundary for her comfort, that's her right. The key is whether the ultimatum is a reasonable way to address the issue. Alternatively, maybe she could have discussed it without making it a sex issue, or he could have been more accommodating.\n\nBut the question is whether she's the asshole. Since the boyfriend is also not addressing her problem and is making a passive-aggressive comment, maybe they both have some responsibility. However, the author's action is to set a boundary, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's response is dismissive. In the AITA framework, the \"asshole\" is the person who acted inconsiderately. Here, the author is trying to address an issue affecting her, while the boyfriend is being dismissive. So maybe the author isn't the asshole. But using sex as a tool is tricky. However, in this case, she's stating her needs. It's a bit of a gray area. Based on the scenario, I think the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
