(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman who decided to stop giving her boyfriend oral sex because he has a lot of pubic hair, which she finds gross. She says he's generally kind and caring, but this one issue keeps coming up, and she finally had enough when she felt hairs in her mouth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that the hair is making oral sex unpleasant for her. She's set a boundary, and he's reacted negatively. The boyfriend's side is that he's being accused of being withholding, but he's still willing to give her oral, which he does. The author is saying he's a mess in that area, but he's not being asked to be anything else. \n\nCommunication is key in relationships. The author might not be at fault for not wanting to have oral sex if it's making her uncomfortable. But the way she presented it could be an issue. She gave an ultimatum, which might be seen as using sex as a form of control. However, if she's been consistent about her discomfort and he hasn't addressed it, maybe she's justified. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is problematic. Accusing her of bargaining with sex and not addressing her request to trim could be dismissive. He should respect her boundaries. But the author's solution (cutting off oral) is a direct response. It's a personal preference, and if she's communicated that and he's not willing to accommodate, maybe she's in the right to set that limit. \n\nHowever, some might argue that using the withdrawal of a sexual act as a punishment is not healthy. But in this case, it's more about personal comfort and consent. If she's not willing, it's her right to say no. The boyfriend's insistence on his own grooming habits without considering her feelings could be the real issue. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for setting a boundary based on her comfort. The boyfriend might be in the wrong for not respecting her request. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
