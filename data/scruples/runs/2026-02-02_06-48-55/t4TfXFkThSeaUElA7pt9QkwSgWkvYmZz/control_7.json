(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman who is cutting off oral sex because her boyfriend's pubic hair is causing her discomfort. She mentions that he's otherwise kind and caring but has strong opinions about her body hair, while his own is unruly. The key points here are communication, mutual respect, and consent in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author is honest about her feelings. She's not comfortable with his body hair, specifically because it's causing her gagging. She communicated her boundaries and set an ultimatum. That seems reasonable because consent is crucial in any sexual activity. If she's uncomfortable, she has the right to express that.\n\nHer boyfriend's reaction is a point to consider. He accused her of withholding and bargaining with sex, and even though he's willing to reciprocate, he didn't address her concerns about the hair. The author's stance is about her own physical discomfort, which is valid. It's not just about preference; it's about her ability to enjoy the act without feeling grossed out or physically affected.\n\nNow, he's described as kind and generous, but his lack of attention to his body hair and not addressing her issue could be a problem. She's trying to maintain her hygiene standards, which he also appreciates in her. The asymmetry here might be an issue. If he's okay with her being clean but doesn't apply the same to himself, that's a possible double standard.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's asserting her boundaries and communicating her needs, that's not wrong. However, maybe the approach could be discussed more effectively. But in terms of right or wrong, her actions are about self-respect and comfort. The boyfriend's refusal to trim might be the bigger issue here because he's not respecting her boundaries once she's communicated them.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary based on her discomfort. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her needs by not addressing the issue they discussed.\n"
