(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the boyfriend has a lot of body hair, especially in the pubic area, and the author is cutting off oral sex because of it. The boyfriend is described as kind and caring otherwise but has strong opinions about the author's hair, which she takes care of. The last straw was when she found pubic hairs in her mouth, which made her gag. She set a boundary, and he got defensive, saying she's bargaining with sex. Now she's questioning if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is setting a personal boundary based on her comfort. She's not in the wrong for having preferences or needing her partner to adjust for her comfort. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is being defensive and not respecting her needs, even though he's described as otherwise caring. The fact that he accuses her of withholding sex is problematic because it's about his own grooming, which he can control. \n\nShe's trying to communicate her needs, which is a healthy part of a relationship. The boyfriend's response is dismissive and possibly hurtful, which could indicate a problem in how he handles conflict. The key here is that personal boundaries are valid, and the other person's reaction to them can determine if there's an issue. Since he's not meeting her halfway and is instead being accusatory, the fault isn't on her. \n\nAlso, the author isn't refusing all intimacy; she's specifically addressing oral sex due to a specific issue. The boyfriend's willingness to reciprocate but not address her concern shows a lack of consideration. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting this boundary. The answer should be B, meaning she's not the asshole here.\n"
