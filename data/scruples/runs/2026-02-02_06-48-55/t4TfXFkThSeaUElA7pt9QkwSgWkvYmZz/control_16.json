(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the boyfriend has a lot of body hair, especially down there, and the author is cutting him off from oral sex because she's uncomfortable with the hair getting in her mouth. She mentions that he's otherwise a good partner but this specific issue is causing a problem.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author is setting a boundary because of her physical discomfort. She's told him she can't handle it anymore and given an ultimatum. He, on the other hand, doesn't seem to take her discomfort seriously and accuses her of using sex as a bargaining tool. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to communicate her needs, but he responded defensively. It's important to consider that personal preferences in intimacy are valid. She's not wrong for having a preference, even if it might seem trivial to others. However, cutting off intimacy over this could be seen as a form of withholding, but only if it's done maliciously. Here, it's more about her genuine discomfort.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems dismissive. Instead of addressing her issue, he focuses on his own actions (still giving oral) and accuses her. That's not a healthy response. The author's request is reasonable\u2014asking him to trim to make her more comfortable. If he's unwilling to accommodate, that's his choice, but that doesn't make her wrong for setting a boundary.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting her needs. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem here, not her setting a boundary. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
