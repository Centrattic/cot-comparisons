(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the boyfriend is insistent on her keeping her body hair trimmed, but he himself has a lot of pubic hair that the author finds uncomfortable during oral sex. She set a boundary, and he reacted by accusing her of withholding and using sex as a bargaining tool.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author likes to be clean, so she's already maintaining her own grooming preferences. The boyfriend's expectations about her hair are part of their dynamic. Now, the issue is his hair. She finds it off-putting, especially when she gags on the hairs. That's a physical reaction, which is a real problem. His response to her ultimatum seems dismissive and possibly gaslighting by saying she's using sex as a way to manipulate.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did communicate her discomfort and set a boundary. The boyfriend's reaction isn't healthy; he shouldn't invalidate her feelings. However, body hair is a personal choice, and unless it's causing harm or health issues, it's more about preferences. The author might be overstepping by making it a deal-breaker, but her reaction is understandable if it's causing her distress. \n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend is content with his grooming and doesn't see the issue, but the author is genuinely uncomfortable, it's her right to set that boundary. The problem is his response. He's not respecting her boundary, which is a bigger issue. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for setting the boundary, but his reaction is worse. The core question is whether enforcing a grooming preference in this context is unreasonable. Since it's affecting her physical comfort and the mood, her decision is reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
