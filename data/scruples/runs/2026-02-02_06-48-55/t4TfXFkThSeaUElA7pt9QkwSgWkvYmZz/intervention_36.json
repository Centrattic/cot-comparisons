(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for cutting off oral sex because of their boyfriend's body hair. The situation is that the boyfriend has a lot of body hair, especially pubic hair, which the author finds off-putting. They had a specific incident where they got hairs in their teeth, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is expressing a personal preference about their partner's grooming habits. They're not just uncomfortable\u2014they're actively avoiding oral sex because of it. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is described as loving and caring but has strong opinions about the author's grooming while not being as particular about his own. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author is setting a boundary based on their comfort level. They're not forcing the issue; they're saying that if the hair isn't trimmed, they can't perform oral sex. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about feeling criticized or accused of being withholding, but the author is clearly stating their needs. \n\nIs it reasonable for someone to have preferences about body hair? Absolutely. People have all sorts of preferences, and it's part of personal boundaries. The author isn't asking for something unreasonable like complete shaving, just trimming. The boyfriend's accusation that they're bargaining with sex might be a deflection. \n\nHowever, the author is choosing to withhold a sexual act based on their partner's grooming. Is that fair? It depends on mutual understanding and whether both parties respect each other's boundaries. The author is being upfront about their discomfort, which is important. The boyfriend's response seems dismissive, not addressing the actual issue but instead focusing on the method of communication. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial that both partners feel their needs are heard. The author is trying to communicate a need, and the boyfriend is reacting negatively. The author isn't at fault for setting a boundary they're comfortable with. The real issue might be the boyfriend's inability to handle the request gracefully. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're asserting their personal boundaries in a consensual relationship. The boyfriend's reaction is more about how the message was delivered rather than the content itself. The author isn't being unreasonable; they're addressing a specific issue that affects their comfort during intimacy.\n"
