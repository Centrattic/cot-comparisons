(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the question is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe author is a woman in a relationship with a boyfriend who's generally caring but has specific issues with her body hair. He wants her to keep it trimmed or shaved, which she's okay with, but she's not happy with his pubic hair. She mentions that during oral sex, she's catching hairs in her mouth, which is really bothering her. The last incident was when she got three hairs in her teeth, leading her to set a boundary: he needs to trim it or she'll stop giving oral. He responded by calling her withholding and using sex as a bargaining tool, and he says he's willing to go down on her even if she's not accommodating. The author feels conflicted because he's otherwise a great partner, but this issue is causing tension.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user wants a straightforward answer: A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions are reasonable. Setting boundaries in a relationship is generally acceptable. The author is expressing her discomfort with his pubic hair during oral sex, which is a personal preference. She's not asking for a huge change, just trimming. The fact that she's communicating her needs and setting a boundary is a valid approach. \n\nHer boyfriend's reaction, however, is problematic. Accusing her of withholding and using sex as a bargaining chip is not healthy. It implies that he's trying to maintain power in the situation by suggesting that his willingness to engage in oral sex is more generous than her refusal. That's manipulative. \n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable. She's addressing a specific issue that affects her comfort during intimacy. Body hair preferences are subjective, and while some people may prefer others to have more hair, the author's preference is valid. The key here is mutual respect and communication. Since the boyfriend isn't respecting her boundary and is reacting with accusations, the issue lies more with his response than the author's initial stance.\n\nHowever, could there be a middle ground? Maybe they could have discussed alternative solutions, like trimming the hair or using a trimmer. But the author has already tried to communicate and set a boundary, so her actions are justified. The boyfriend's refusal to meet her halfway and his accusatory behavior make him the one at fault here.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions are about setting a personal boundary, which is necessary for her well-being and comfort. The boyfriend's response is the issue, not her decision to set the boundary. So the answer should be B.\n"
