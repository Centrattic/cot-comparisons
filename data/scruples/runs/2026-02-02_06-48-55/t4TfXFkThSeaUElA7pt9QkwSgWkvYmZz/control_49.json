(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend not shaving his pubic hair, and the author has decided to cut off oral sex until he trims it. The boyfriend is described as otherwise loving and caring, but this is causing issues.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that she likes being clean-shaven herself, which aligns with her boyfriend's preference for her to be neat. So she's following his preferences there, but he's not following hers in terms of his grooming. The problem arises when she catches pubic hairs in her mouth during oral sex, which is making her gag. That's a valid physical reaction\u2014nobody wants to feel that. She tells him she can't continue oral until he trims, and he responds by accusing her of being withholding and using sex as a bargaining chip, even though he's willing to reciprocate.\n\nNow, from a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author is setting a boundary based on her comfort, which is reasonable. If she's not comfortable with the current state of his grooming, she has a right to express that. However, cutting off oral sex as a form of ultimatum could be seen as using sex as leverage, which some might view as manipulative. But in this case, the ultimatum is about her own comfort and safety (not wanting to gag) rather than punishment.\n\nThe boyfriend's response is problematic because he's dismissing her valid concern and instead accusing her. He's not considering her physical discomfort and is focusing on his own perspective. The fact that he's willing to continue giving her oral but doesn't want to trim his hair shows a lack of consideration for her needs. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? She's setting a boundary to protect her own well-being. While using sexual favors as a bargaining chip can be a red flag, in this case, it's about a physical issue that's affecting her enjoyment and comfort. She's not punishing him; she's requesting a change in behavior to make intimacy more comfortable. The boyfriend's insensitivity is the bigger issue here. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's addressing a legitimate issue and setting a boundary. The boyfriend needs to be more accommodating and empathetic. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
