(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The situation is about the author cutting off oral sex from her boyfriend because he has a lot of pubic hair, which she's uncomfortable with. She says he's a loving and caring person but has strong opinions about her body hair while his own is messy. The last straw was when she found hair in her mouth and gagged, leading her to set a boundary. He accused her of withholding and using sex as leverage.\n\nSo, first, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about mutual respect in a relationship and the right to set personal boundaries. The author is expressing her discomfort with his body hair, which is a personal preference. She's not forcing him to change, but she's setting a boundary by not engaging in oral sex if he doesn't trim. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is not happy with this and is arguing that he's being more generous by still performing oral on her.\n\nIs it the author's right to set this boundary? In relationships, communication and mutual respect are important. If the author is uncomfortable, she has the right to express that. However, using a sexual act as a bargaining tool might be seen as withholding. But in this case, she's not withholding sex entirely; she's specifically not doing oral unless the issue is addressed. It's about her personal comfort and hygiene. \n\nThe boyfriend's accusation that she's bargaining with sex could be a red flag. It's possible he's not respecting her boundary. If he's not open to compromise, that might be an issue. The author is not being unreasonable by wanting to avoid discomfort. His reaction of calling her out for withholding might be more about deflection than the actual issue.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary based on her personal comfort. The boyfriend's response is problematic because he's not respecting her needs and is instead accusing her. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
