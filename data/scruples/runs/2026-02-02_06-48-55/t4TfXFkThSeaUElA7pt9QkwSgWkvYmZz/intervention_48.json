(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the boyfriend has a lot of body hair, especially in the pubic area, and the author is cutting him off from oral sex because of it. The key points here are about personal preferences in intimacy and communication.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that her boyfriend is otherwise kind and caring, but he's very insistent on her being clean-shaven. She likes being clean too, so that's a mutual point. But the issue is his own hair causing her discomfort during oral sex. She had a bad experience where she got hairs in her mouth and decided to set a boundary. He responded with accusations of withholding sex and bargaining.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a communication standpoint, it's important that both partners express their needs and boundaries. The author is stating her physical discomfort and setting a boundary by asking him to trim his hair. Her boyfriend's reaction seems to be defensive and dismissive of her feelings. \n\nHowever, cutting off oral sex entirely might be seen as a form of using sex as leverage, which isn't healthy. But the author is doing it because of a valid reason\u2014her personal discomfort. On the other hand, her boyfriend's argument about still being willing to perform oral on her might come off as dismissive of her feelings. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial for both partners to communicate their needs and find a middle ground. The author's request is specific (trimming hair) and reasonable, but the way she's enforcing it by cutting off oral might be seen as extreme. However, if she's communicated this clearly and he hasn't complied, then she's within her rights to set that boundary. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't entirely in the wrong because she's expressing her needs, but maybe she could approach it with more open dialogue rather than an ultimatum. But given the situation as presented, the boyfriend's reaction seems more uncooperative. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
