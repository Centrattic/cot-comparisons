(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for cutting off oral sex because of her boyfriend's body hair.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the boyfriend's excessive pubic hair causing discomfort during oral sex. The author mentions that she's clean-shaven, which aligns with her preferences, but her partner's hair is causing her gagging and physical discomfort. The last straw was when she found multiple hairs in her teeth, which was a significant trigger.\n\nThe boyfriend's response is to accuse her of withholding sex and bargaining with it. That's a classic deflection. He's not addressing her valid concern about her physical discomfort but instead framing it as her being manipulative. He also points out that he's willing to perform oral on her, which isn't directly related to her issue but serves to make her feel guilty.\n\nFrom a relationship dynamics perspective, communication is key. The author tried to express her boundaries, which is healthy. Setting boundaries around physical intimacy is normal and necessary. The boyfriend's reaction, however, is problematic because he's not respecting her feelings and is instead retaliating. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether her actions are justified. Since she's communicated her discomfort and set a boundary based on her physical well-being, she's acting within her rights. The boyfriend's insensitivity and refusal to accommodate her needs are the real issues here. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions are a response to her partner's unwillingness to meet her needs, which is a valid reason for setting limits. The boyfriend's behavior is dismissive and disrespectful, making him the one at fault.\n"
