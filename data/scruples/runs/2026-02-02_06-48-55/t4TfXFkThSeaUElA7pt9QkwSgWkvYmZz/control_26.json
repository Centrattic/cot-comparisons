(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend has a lot of body hair, especially in the pubic area, which the author finds distracting and unpleasant during oral sex. The author decided to cut off oral contact unless he trims his hair. The boyfriend accused her of being withholding and using sex as a bargaining chip.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's reasons for her actions and the boyfriend's reaction. The author states that the hair is causing her discomfort and ruining the mood. She mentions an incident where she caught hairs in her teeth and gagged. She also notes that she's clean-shaven and prefers it, while he's messy. The boyfriend, on the other hand, insists she's being unreasonable and that he's still willing to reciprocate.\n\nI need to assess if the author's actions are justified. From a personal preference standpoint, people have different comfort levels in intimacy. If the hair is a significant issue for her, it's reasonable for her to express that and set boundaries. However, using the withdrawal of oral sex as a condition might be seen as using sex as leverage, which can be problematic in some contexts. But considering her discomfort is genuine and she's communicating her needs, it's about mutual respect and finding a solution.\n\nThe boyfriend's response seems dismissive, not addressing her actual concern (the hair) and instead focusing on her withholding sex. That's unhelpful. The author is trying to address a legitimate issue affecting her enjoyment and comfort. So, while the method might be a point of discussion, the root of her issue is valid. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
