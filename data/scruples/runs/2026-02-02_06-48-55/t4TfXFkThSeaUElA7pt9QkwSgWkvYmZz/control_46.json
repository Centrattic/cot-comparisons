(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the provided scenario carefully.\n\nThe author is a woman in a relationship with her boyfriend, who is described as loving and caring. However, she has an issue with his body hair, particularly in the pubic area. She mentions that he's not particular about his own hair but has strong opinions about hers, which she's okay with because she likes to be clean. The key issue is that during oral sex, she finds his pubic hair uncomfortable, even to the point of gagging when she caught some hairs. She set a boundary that he needs to trim it or she won't give him oral. He responded negatively, calling her withholding and using sex as a bargaining chip, which she found frustrating.\n\nNow, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The main points are her right to set boundaries and his reaction. Setting personal boundaries, especially in intimate relationships, is generally considered healthy. If she's uncomfortable with his body hair to the point it's affecting her enjoyment and causing physical discomfort, it's reasonable for her to communicate this. She did ask him to trim, which is a reasonable request. His response, however, seems dismissive and perhaps manipulative by suggesting she's using sex as leverage, even though she's stating her needs.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that men's body hair is natural and that she should manage her own comfort, perhaps using techniques to avoid the hairs. But the problem here is that her comfort is being directly impacted, and she's making a request that's about her own experience. It's not about his hair per se but how it affects her during intimacy. \n\nHis reaction of accusing her of being withholding could be a deflection. The fact that he's okay with her being clean but expects her to handle his hair might be a double standard. The question is whether her setting this boundary is valid. Since she's not the one with the issue (he's the one with the hair causing her discomfort), her request seems justified. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Is she overreacting? Maybe, but if it's causing her physical gagging, that's a legitimate issue. Also, the ultimatum she set is a form of communication, which some might see as a strong move, but in the context of personal boundaries, it's a way to enforce her needs. \n\nConsidering all this, it seems the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her right to comfort and communication, which are essential in relationships. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
