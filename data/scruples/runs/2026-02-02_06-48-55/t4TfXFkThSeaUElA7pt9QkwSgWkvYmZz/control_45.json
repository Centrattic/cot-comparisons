(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who is insistent about the author's body hair but not his own. The author decided to cut off giving him oral sex because of his pubic hair causing discomfort. The boyfriend is upset and accused her of being withholding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid concern about physical discomfort during oral sex. Hair in the mouth can be unpleasant and even cause gagging. She's communicated her issue and set a boundary by asking him to trim. However, when he didn't comply, she took action by stopping oral, which led to conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend feels hurt and accused her of using sex as leverage. He might feel that his efforts to care for her (like taking care of her waxing) are being overlooked, and he's upset that she's withholding oral sex. But his own body hair is a problem here, not hers. The author's issue is about his grooming preferences affecting her comfort.\n\nThe key points are communication and mutual respect. The author tried to address the issue, but when the boyfriend didn't meet her needs, she took action. Setting boundaries in relationships is important. If his hair is a hygiene or comfort issue for her, it's reasonable to ask him to trim. However, using the withdrawal of a sexual act as a consequence might be seen as a form of negotiation, which the boyfriend is uncomfortable with. But the root issue is his grooming affecting her comfort, which is a personal preference.\n\nIs the author wrong? It depends on cultural or personal beliefs. In many contexts, personal preferences about body hair are subjective. However, when it affects physical comfort and communication is attempted, the person's right to set boundaries is valid. The boyfriend's reaction of accusing her of bargaining might be his insecurity or feeling that his efforts aren't appreciated. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her comfort, especially after clear communication. So the answer is B.\n"
