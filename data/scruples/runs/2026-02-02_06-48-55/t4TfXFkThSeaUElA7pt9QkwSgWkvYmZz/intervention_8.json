(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a boyfriend who's upset about the author not giving him oral sex because he's hairy down there. The author mentions that the boyfriend is caring and loving otherwise, but has a lot of opinions about her body hair. She's okay with trimming hers, but his pubic hair is causing her discomfort during oral. The last incident was when she got hair in her mouth and gagged, leading her to set a boundary. He accused her of withholding sex and using it as a bargaining chip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is making a legitimate physical discomfort issue. Getting hair in her mouth and gagging is a real problem, and it's affecting her enjoyment. She's asking him to trim, which seems reasonable. On the other hand, the boyfriend feels rejected or accused when she sets this boundary. He might feel that his personal grooming isn't being respected, or that she's using sex as leverage. But from the author's perspective, it's about her comfort and consent. She's not refusing all intimacy, just oral. She's also clear that he's caring in other ways.\n\nCommunication is key here. If she's been expressing her discomfort and he's not taking it seriously, maybe there's a deeper issue. The boyfriend's response of accusing her of bargaining with sex could indicate he's not taking her feelings seriously. Setting boundaries in a relationship is important for mutual respect. If he's not willing to trim for her comfort, maybe there's a problem. However, the author is making a choice based on her own needs, which is valid. The question is whether cutting off oral is an unreasonable ultimatum or a reasonable boundary.\n\nThe author isn't the one causing the issue; his grooming habits are. She's trying to address it. The boyfriend's reaction seems dismissive. The key here is whether the author is justified in setting a boundary for her own well-being. Since she's not refusing all intimacy, just adjusting her actions based on her comfort, it's more about her right to set limits. The boyfriend's response of accusing her of being withholding might be the real problem here. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary to protect her own experience. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
