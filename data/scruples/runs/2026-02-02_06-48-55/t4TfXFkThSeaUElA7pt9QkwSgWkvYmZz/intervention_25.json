(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author cutting off oral sex from their boyfriend because of his pubic hair. The author mentions that the boyfriend is otherwise loving and caring, but he's insistent on her keeping her body hair trimmed while he has a lot of his own. The last straw was when she found pubic hairs in her mouth during oral, leading her to set a boundary. The boyfriend accused her of withholding sex and bargaining, while she feels he's the one who's \"a mess.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is setting a boundary based on her comfort. She's not happy with his body hair and the practical issue of hair getting caught in her teeth. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is not happy with her ultimatum and accuses her of using sex as a bargaining chip. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect for boundaries are key. If the author has expressed her discomfort before and the boyfriend didn't take it seriously, then her setting a boundary might be justified. However, if she just suddenly decided to cut off oral without prior discussion, that could be seen as using sex as a weapon. \n\nThe author mentions that the boyfriend is \"otherwise a loving and caring person\" but has a specific issue with her hair. It's interesting that he's not bothered by his own hair but expects her to maintain hers. There's a double standard here. The author is trying to address a personal discomfort, which is valid. The boyfriend's reaction might be dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThe key points are: \n1. The author has a legitimate reason for discomfort (hair in her mouth).\n2. She tried to communicate her need for him to trim his hair.\n3. The boyfriend's response was to accuse her of withholding sex, which could be a sign of not respecting her boundaries.\n4. The author is trying to maintain her own standards, which is reasonable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about whether her action of cutting off oral is a reasonable response. If the boyfriend was aware of her preference and still didn't comply, then the author's boundary is valid. However, if she didn't communicate her discomfort before this incident, then cutting off oral might be seen as a sudden ultimatum. The post says she's been having \"many instances\" of the hair issue, so it's likely she's had prior issues. Therefore, her setting a boundary after repeated issues is defensible.\n\nThe boyfriend's accusation of her withholding sex is problematic because he's not respecting her comfort zone. Using sex as a bargaining chip is a negative dynamic. The author is not in the wrong for prioritizing her own comfort and hygiene. The boyfriend's reaction is more in the wrong here. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
