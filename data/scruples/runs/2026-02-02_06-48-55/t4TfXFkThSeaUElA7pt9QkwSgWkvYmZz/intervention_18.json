(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author wrote about cutting off oral sex for their boyfriend because of his body hair, specifically the pubic hair. They mention that the boyfriend is otherwise caring but has strong opinions about her body hair. The key issue is the author's ultimatum regarding his body hair.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author has a valid concern about discomfort during intimacy, especially when they found hairs in their mouth. That's unpleasant and understandable. They communicated their feelings, which is a good step. The boyfriend, on the other hand, didn't take it well and accused her of using sex as leverage. That's a problem because it's not a healthy way to handle the situation. \n\nThe author's action is about setting a boundary based on personal discomfort. They're not withholding affection for other reasons but because of a specific issue. However, using oral sex as a bargaining chip might be seen as using intimacy as leverage, which isn't healthy in a relationship. The boyfriend's response was also problematic, as he didn't validate her feelings and instead turned it into a power struggle.\n\nSo, who is at fault? The author is taking a stand for their comfort, which is their right. But the method of withholding oral sex might be a form of manipulation. The boyfriend's defensiveness and lack of empathy are also issues. The situation is complex because both have valid points. The author's discomfort is real, but the ultimatum approach could be seen as extreme. However, the boyfriend's reaction is also unhelpful. \n\nIn terms of who is the asshole, it's a bit of a toss-up. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The initial action of setting a boundary isn't inherently wrong, but using sex as a tool for that might be. Still, the author's main issue is a legitimate physical discomfort. I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because their request is about their own comfort, but their method could be improved. The boyfriend is also at fault for his reaction. Since the question asks if the author is in the wrong, the answer would be B (No).\n"
