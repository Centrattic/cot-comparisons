(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for cutting off oral sex with their boyfriend because of his body hair, specifically pubic hair. They mention that he has a lot of opinions about her hair, but she finds his to be an issue. The last incident was when she felt hairs in her mouth, which made her gag, leading to an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a right to her preferences in intimacy. If his hair is causing her physical discomfort, that's a legitimate concern. However, the way she handled it\u2014using the threat of cutting off oral sex\u2014might be a point of contention. The boyfriend accused her of withholding and bargaining with sex, which suggests that he might feel the request is unfair or manipulative.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, she's communicating her needs and boundaries, which is important in a relationship. But using a specific sexual act as a conditional response can be seen as a form of ultimatum, which might not be the healthiest approach. The boyfriend's reaction might be about feeling judged, especially since he has his own preferences about her hair. Maybe there's a lack of mutual respect here?\n\nOn the other hand, the author's discomfort is real and could affect her enjoyment of the relationship. If she's not comfortable, it's reasonable to express that. But the method of expressing it\u2014suddenly cutting off oral without prior discussion\u2014might be abrupt. Perhaps a more collaborative approach to discuss both their preferences and find a middle ground would be better. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. I think it's a matter of perspective. She's not necessarily wrong for having a preference, but the way she's enforcing it might be. The boyfriend's reaction could indicate that he feels disrespected, but he also needs to consider her feelings. The ideal situation would involve both parties communicating their needs and working together to find solutions. If she's giving ultimatums, that could be a red flag. So, the answer might be A because the approach is manipulative, but the issue itself isn't her fault. Wait, the options are to say if the author is in the wrong. The problem is the method of cutting off oral with an ultimatum. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if her preference is valid, then B. Hmm. The key is whether using sex as a bargaining chip is wrong. In that case, the author might be in the wrong because it's not healthy. So I'll go with A.\n"
