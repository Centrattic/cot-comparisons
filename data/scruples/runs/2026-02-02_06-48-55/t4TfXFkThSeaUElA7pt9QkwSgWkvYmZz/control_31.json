(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple's disagreement over body hair, specifically the boyfriend's pubic hair causing the author to feel uncomfortable during oral sex. The author decided to cut off oral contact until he trims it, and he responded negatively.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate whether the author's actions are justified. The key points here are consent and personal boundaries. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's preferences and boundaries. The author is setting a boundary about something that affects her comfort. Body hair is a personal choice, and while some people may have preferences, the author isn't asking for a drastic change, just trimming to avoid physical discomfort. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems dismissive. He accuses her of withholding sex and using it as leverage, but he's not addressing her valid concern. It's important to consider that physical discomfort during intimacy is a legitimate issue. The author isn't rejecting him but is instead asking for a reasonable adjustment that affects her enjoyment and comfort. \n\nThe boyfriend's lack of attention to his own grooming in this area is his choice, but the author has the right to express that her preferences matter. Using oral sex as a bargaining chip or making her feel guilty for setting a boundary is not healthy. The fact that he's still willing to reciprocate but not accept her need for trimming shows a lack of mutual respect. \n\nHowever, the author should have communicated her needs earlier rather than waiting for the last straw. Open dialogue before the issue escalates would have been better, but that doesn't mean she's in the wrong now. She's taking a stand for her comfort, which is important in a relationship. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong. She's asserting her right to physical comfort and setting a boundary. The boyfriend's reaction is the issue here, as he's not respecting her needs and is using guilt tactics. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
