(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend has a lot of body hair, and the author is cutting off oral sex because of it. The boyfriend is described as loving and caring, but he's insistent on the author being clean-shaven. The last straw was when the author found pubic hairs in her teeth and refused oral sex, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accused her of withholding sex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid concern about physical discomfort during intimacy. Finding hairs in her mouth and gagging is a real issue, and it's understandable that this would affect her experience. Body hair preferences are personal, so her request for him to trim could be seen as reasonable if it's something she's uncomfortable with.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is accused of being insistent about the author's grooming, but when she sets a boundary about his grooming, he accuses her of bargaining. He still offers to reciprocate, which might suggest he's not being unreasonable in that aspect. However, if he's not open to compromising on his own grooming, that could be a problem.\n\nThe author is setting a boundary, which is her right. However, cutting off oral sex as a form of ultimatum might be seen as using sex as a bargaining chip. But in this case, it's more about personal comfort and safety. The key here is whether the author's request is reasonable. Since body hair is a common issue, and he's not willing to trim, maybe she's justified. But maybe the way she's enforcing it is where the problem lies.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have communicated her discomfort earlier and found a compromise instead of an ultimatum. But given the context of the last straw being gagging, it's a significant issue. The boyfriend's response of accusing her of bargaining is unhelpful, so maybe the author isn't the only one at fault.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is setting a boundary for her comfort. While using an ultimatum can be seen as withholding, in this case, it's about her physical well-being during intimacy. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. The boyfriend is also at fault for not being considerate of her needs and not compromising. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. I think the answer is B (No), because she's standing up for her own comfort and health in a relationship where he isn't respecting her needs.\n"
