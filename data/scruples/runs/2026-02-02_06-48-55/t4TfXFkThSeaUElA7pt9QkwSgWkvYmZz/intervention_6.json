(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is a woman in a relationship where her boyfriend is pressuring her to trim or shave her body hair. She's a fan of being clean-shaven, so that aligns with his preferences. However, the issue is with his pubic hair. She finds it unruly and it's causing her discomfort during oral sex. The last incident was when she caught pubic hairs in her teeth, leading her to cut off oral contact. He accused her of using sex as leverage, while she feels his hair is the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual respect in relationships. Both partners should have the right to express their preferences and boundaries. The author's discomfort is valid; physical intimacy should be a positive experience for both. However, cutting off oral sex as a punishment might be seen as using a sexual act as a bargaining chip. That could be where the user's thought that the author is in the wrong comes from. On the other hand, her request for him to trim his hair isn't unreasonable, especially if it's affecting her comfort.\n\nThe boyfriend's response, accusing her of withholding sex and not considering her comfort, might indicate a lack of empathy. But the author deciding to stop oral because he's not meeting her needs could be seen as taking control of her own boundaries. It's a balance between respecting each other's needs and the methods used to address them.\n\nIn terms of who's the asshole, the question is about ultimatums and whether cutting off oral is justified. If the author communicated her needs and he was dismissive, then her action is about self-respect. However, if she didn't give him a chance to adjust, maybe there's room for negotiation. But given the description, she tried to communicate, he didn't take it seriously, leading her to set a boundary. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But using a sexual act as a demand could be problematic. The key is whether her action was a boundary or a punishment. Since she's setting a boundary for her comfort, she's not in the wrong. So the answer might be B.\n"
