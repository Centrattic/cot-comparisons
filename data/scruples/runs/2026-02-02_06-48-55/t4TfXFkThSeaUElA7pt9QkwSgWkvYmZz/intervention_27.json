(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend doesn't trim his pubic hair, and the author is cutting him off from oral sex because of it. The author mentions that the boyfriend is otherwise kind but has strong opinions about her body hair, while his own hair is causing her discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is expressing a valid discomfort with the physical aspect of oral sex due to the hair. It's a personal preference and can affect intimacy. On the other hand, the boyfriend is accused of being inconsistent\u2014he's insistent on her grooming but doesn't maintain his own. The author is setting a boundary, which is okay, but the way the situation is presented might show a power imbalance. \n\nThe boyfriend's response accusing her of bargaining with sex and being withholding could be a red flag. He's using his willingness to perform oral sex as a counter, which might be manipulative. The author is justified in setting a boundary that affects her comfort. However, cutting off oral sex is a form of withholding intimacy, which can be seen as leverage in a relationship. But if it's a personal health or comfort issue, it's reasonable.\n\nThe username mentions \"things aren't peachy down there,\" which might imply the author has her own grooming preferences, and the boyfriend's lack of attention to his grooming is causing a problem. The author is not in the wrong for expressing her needs. The boyfriend's reaction might be more problematic, as he's not respecting her boundary. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
