(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off oral sex because of her boyfriend's body hair. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that her boyfriend is generally loving and caring. But he's weird about her body hair, insisting she trims or shaves, even though he doesn't pay much attention to his own. Now, she's having issues with his pubic hair during oral sex, which is causing her discomfort. The last straw was when she found hairs in her mouth and gagged. She told him to trim it or there would be no oral sex, and he accused her of being withholding.\n\nHmm, so she's setting a boundary based on her comfort. She's not the one being insistent about his grooming, but he is about hers. She's asking if she's the asshole here. \n\nOn one hand, communication is key in relationships. She did tell him her issue, and he didn't respond well. Maybe he's more concerned about her grooming standards than his own. She's trying to address a problem that's affecting her enjoyment. \n\nOn the other hand, refusing oral sex could be seen as using sex as leverage. But in this case, she's stating her needs because it's causing her physical discomfort. If he's not willing to trim his hair to meet her needs, maybe he's not respecting her boundaries. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. She's not being unreasonable; she's asking for a change that would make the experience better for her. He might need to adjust his grooming habits. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, is it fair to cut off oral sex as a punishment? Maybe there's a better way to handle it, like discussing alternatives or finding a compromise. However, she's stating her needs clearly. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's setting a boundary for her comfort. The boyfriend's reaction might be the issue, as he's not addressing her concern and is making it about himself. The problem lies in his unwillingness to trim, not her setting the limit.\n"
