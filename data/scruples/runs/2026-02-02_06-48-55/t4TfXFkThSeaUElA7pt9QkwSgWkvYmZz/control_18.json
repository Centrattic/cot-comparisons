(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the boyfriend has a lot of body hair, particularly pubic hair, and the author is cutting him off from oral sex because of it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author mentions that her boyfriend is otherwise kind and caring, but he's very strict about her body hair, wanting her to trim or shave, yet he himself has a lot of hair. The problem arises when she finds pubic hairs in her mouth during oral sex, which is causing her discomfort and gagging. She sets a boundary that he needs to trim, but he accuses her of withholding sex and bargaining, even though he's still willing to perform oral on her.\n\nSo, the key points are about mutual respect in relationships and setting boundaries. The author is expressing a legitimate physical discomfort. It's her right to set boundaries regarding her own comfort in intimacy. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems dismissive of her feelings, calling her withholding, which might be invalidating her perspective. \n\nHe's also being inconsistent with his expectations, wanting her to maintain a certain standard while not applying the same to himself. That could contribute to her frustration. The fact that he's still willing to perform oral on her despite his own appearance not meeting the same standard might highlight a double standard.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't wrong for wanting to communicate her needs. Healthy relationships involve communication and compromise. If he's not respecting her boundaries, that's on him. She's not in the wrong for stating her needs, even if the issue seems minor. People have different preferences and sensitivities, and it's important to address them respectfully.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. Body hair is a personal choice, and while some might find it an issue, it's not a deal-breaker for everyone. However, the author is specific about her discomfort, which is valid. The boyfriend's response of accusing her of bargaining with sex is a classic deflection and might indicate a problem in how he handles conflict.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't the asshole here. She's communicating her needs, and the boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
