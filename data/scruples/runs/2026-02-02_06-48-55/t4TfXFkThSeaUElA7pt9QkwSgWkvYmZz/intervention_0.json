(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a relationship where the girlfriend is cutting off oral sex because of her boyfriend's body hair, specifically his pubic hair. She's frustrated because he doesn't trim it, leading to hairs getting caught in her teeth. He responds by calling her withholding and using sex as a bargaining chip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is the one setting boundaries based on her physical discomfort. She's clear that she's not interested in oral sex unless he trims the hair. Her reasoning is that it's causing her gagging and ruining the mood. On the other hand, the boyfriend is accused of being insistent about her shaving but not his own hair, and he's reacting poorly when she sets a boundary by withholding oral sex.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author is expressing her needs, which is healthy. However, using sex as a form of leverage can be problematic. The boyfriend's response of \"he'll still go down on me\" might imply he's doing it as a favor, which could be seen as condescending. But the author is also using withholding sex as a way to enforce her preference, which could be seen as a form of manipulation or using sex as a bargaining chip, just as he accused her of.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if she's using oral sex as a way to control the situation rather than discussing it openly. However, she's also within her rights to have her comfort and boundaries respected. The key is whether her action is a reasonable boundary or a form of manipulation. Since she's communicating her needs and setting a clear boundary based on her own discomfort, she's not wrong for doing that. The boyfriend's reaction is also problematic because he's not addressing her concern and instead is retaliating.\n\nSo, considering that both parties have valid points but the author is asserting her boundaries, which is important in a relationship, the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong. However, the way she's using oral sex as an ultimatum could be seen as using sex as a bargaining chip, which the boyfriend also accused her of. That complicates things. But her main issue is her physical discomfort, which is a legitimate reason to set a boundary. The boyfriend's lack of willingness to accommodate her reasonable request is the bigger issue here.\n"
