(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves her boyfriend's body hair and her decision to cut off oral sex until he trims it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is saying that her boyfriend is pressuring her to keep her body hair clean, but he himself has a lot of pubic hair, which she finds problematic. She had an incident where she got hairs in her mouth during oral sex, which was unpleasant. She gave him an ultimatum to trim his hair or she won't perform oral sex. He responded by accusing her of withholding sex and bargaining, and she's now asking if she's the asshole.\n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is that he's being told to change for her comfort, while she's okay with her own grooming but not his. He might feel that his preferences are being dismissed. On the other hand, the author is standing up for her personal boundaries and comfort. She's not asking for a huge change, just trimming to make oral sex more pleasant for her.\n\nBody hair is a personal choice and varies a lot between individuals. The key here is mutual respect and communication. The author is communicating her needs, which is important in a relationship. However, using sex as a bargaining chip can be a red flag. She's saying she won't perform oral unless he trims, which could be seen as withholding intimacy for non-negotiable reasons. But her reasoning is about her own comfort and health (since the hairs were causing a gagging reaction).\n\nThe boyfriend accuses her of being withholding and bargaining with sex. That's a serious accusation because using sex as a tool for control can be problematic. However, she's stating that it's about her own well-being. The question is whether her request is reasonable. Trimming is a small ask compared to other grooming practices people have. It's not about his body hair in general but specifically about the pubic area affecting oral sex.\n\nThe author might be overreacting if she's using this as a way to control the relationship. But if she's genuinely uncomfortable and it's affecting their intimacy, her stance is valid. The boyfriend's response, however, is dismissive and defensive, which isn't helpful. He should be open to understanding her perspective instead of accusing her.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author is asserting her boundaries, which is healthy. However, cutting off oral sex entirely might be an extreme measure. Maybe there's a middle ground, like using a trimmer or finding a way to manage the hairs without a full trim. But given the situation, she's not the asshole because she's communicating her needs. The boyfriend's reaction is more about deflection. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
