(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for cutting off oral sex because of her boyfriend's pubic hair. The situation seems a bit complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author explains that her boyfriend is generally loving and caring but has strong opinions about her body hair, even though he doesn't take care of his own. She likes being clean-shaven herself, which aligns with his preferences. However, his pubic hair is causing her discomfort during oral sex, leading her to set a boundary. The last incident was when she found hairs in her mouth, which was unpleasant and made her gag. She told him she can't continue unless he trims his hair, and he responded by accusing her of withholding sex and bargaining with it, while he's still willing to perform oral on her.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal boundaries, communication, and mutual respect. The author is setting a boundary for her comfort, which is her right. However, the way she's enforcing it by cutting off oral might be seen as using sex as a bargaining chip, which can be problematic in relationships. On the other hand, her boyfriend isn't respecting her comfort level with his hair not being trimmed, which could be seen as a lack of consideration for her needs.\n\nThe boyfriend's response, accusing her of withholding sex, might indicate that he's not open to compromise. But the author is also making a demand for him to change something that affects her enjoyment. The question is whether her action is fair or if she's overstepping.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Both parties have valid points. The author is justified in wanting comfort during intimacy, but using the threat of cutting off oral might not be the healthiest approach. However, if her partner isn't willing to meet her halfway, she's within her rights to set that boundary. The boyfriend's reaction could be dismissive of her feelings, which isn't great either. But ultimately, the decision to set a boundary is her choice unless it's based on something more harmful. Since this is a personal preference and not a deal-breaker on a larger scale, the author might not be in the wrong. Alternatively, if she's using sex as leverage, that's where the problem could lie. But given the context, it's more about personal comfort. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she's asserting her needs, even if the approach could be improved.\n"
