(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for cutting off oral sex due to her boyfriend's pubic hair. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is unhappy with her bf's body hair, especially pubic hair, which she finds unhygienic or a mood killer. She's a fan of being clean-shaven, and he's not. She set a boundary that he needs to trim it, otherwise, no oral sex. He responded by criticizing her and even bringing up that he's willing to reciprocate, which she finds unfair.\n\nNow, considering mutual respect in relationships. Both partners should be able to express their needs and boundaries. The author is clear about her discomfort, which is a valid feeling. Setting a boundary isn't inherently wrong. However, using sex as a bargaining chip (withholding oral sex) can be a point of contention. Some might argue that this is a form of manipulation, while others see it as a necessary boundary.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also important. He accuses her of withholding and doesn't acknowledge her valid concern. His response might be dismissive. But the author's issue is about her physical comfort and hygiene, which are legitimate. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. Maybe the author could have suggested trimming instead of an ultimatum. But she did give him a chance by saying he needs to trim. If he's unwilling to meet her halfway, then the issue becomes about respecting each other's preferences. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If withholding oral sex is seen as using sex for control, then A. But if it's about her right to set boundaries based on her comfort, then B. Since both sides have valid points, but the author's action is about her personal comfort and she communicated her needs, the answer might lean towards B. However, the ultimatum approach might not be the healthiest way to handle it. But the question is whether she's in the wrong, not whether her approach is the best. Given that her reason is personal preference and she's communicated it, the answer is likely B.\n"
