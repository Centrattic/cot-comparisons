(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The question is about whether cutting off oral sex because of their boyfriend's body hair is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author's boyfriend is generally caring and loving. However, he's not happy with her body hair, pushing her to trim or shave. But the issue arises when she gives him oral sex and gets annoyed by his pubic hair. She sets a boundary that he needs to trim, and when he doesn't, she stops giving oral. He then accuses her of using sex as a bargaining chip.\n\nThe author is conflicted because she feels it's trivial but can't help setting an ultimatum. She asks who the asshole is here. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if that's correct.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The boyfriend's behavior about her hair might be controlling or critical, but he's also meeting her needs by taking care of her grooming. The author's action of withholding oral sex is a form of negotiating boundaries about his body hair. However, using sex as leverage can be problematic in a relationship. On the other hand, the boyfriend's not addressing her concerns by trimming his hair could be seen as dismissive. \n\nIs her action an ultimatum? She's setting a boundary for her comfort, which is valid. But is it fair to withhold intimacy over this? It's a common issue in relationships where personal preferences affect physical intimacy. The key is mutual respect. If she's uncomfortable, she has the right to express that. However, the boyfriend's reaction (accusing her of bargaining) suggests he feels disrespected. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if she's using sex as a weapon, but if she's setting a boundary for her own comfort, she's not. The question is whether her action is reasonable. Since she's communicating her needs and the boyfriend isn't meeting them, maybe she's justified. Alternatively, maybe finding a compromise would be better than an ultimatum. \n\nBut the situation is complex. The boyfriend's criticism of her hair versus her issue with his hair creates a power imbalance. The author's decision to stop oral sex is a personal choice. However, the way she frames it as an ultimatum might be seen as manipulative. The boyfriend's response is also problematic because he's not addressing her valid concern. \n\nIn terms of who's the asshole, it's a bit of both. But the question is specifically about the author. If the answer is A (she's in the wrong), it's because using sex as leverage is inappropriate. If B (not in the wrong), because she's asserting her boundaries. \n\nI think the answer is B. She's not in the wrong because she's setting a boundary for her own comfort, which is valid. The boyfriend's response is more concerning because he's dismissing her feelings and using his own behavior as a counterpoint. Negotiating mutual respect is key here.\n"
