(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for cutting off oral sex due to their boyfriend's body hair. \n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The boyfriend is described as kind and caring, but he's insistent on the author keeping their own body hair clean, while his own is described as \"unruly.\" The author is uncomfortable with his pubic hair during oral, leading to gagging and a request for him to trim it. When he doesn't, she stops giving oral, and he accuses her of being withholding. \n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong. The question is whether their actions are justified. \n\nConsiderations: In relationships, personal preferences about body hair can vary. The author is making a request based on her comfort. However, cutting off oral sex as a form of ultimatum might be seen as using sex as a bargaining tool. The boyfriend is accused of being inconsistent\u2014he wants her to be clean but isn't willing to trim his own hair. \n\nThe author's action is a boundary based on her physical discomfort, but enforcing it by refusing oral could be seen as a form of punishment or control. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014accusing her of bargaining with sex\u2014might indicate he feels manipulated, even if the root issue is his grooming choice.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If she's expressing her needs and setting boundaries, that's healthy. However, the method of cutting off intimacy without resolution might be problematic. The boyfriend's lack of action on his grooming is also an issue. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author has a valid discomfort, but the ultimatum approach could be seen as extreme. Alternatively, the boyfriend's refusal to adjust his grooming despite her clear discomfort could make him partially at fault. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether setting a boundary is in the wrong. Since the author is advocating for her own comfort, she's not necessarily in the wrong. However, the way she's enforcing it without dialogue might be. But the question is whether she's in the wrong at all. Given that the issue is about personal preference and mutual adjustment, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
