(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a relationship where the boyfriend has a lot of body hair and the author is uncomfortable with it during oral sex. The author decided to cut off oral contact until he trims his hair, and the boyfriend is upset about it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is clear that the boyfriend is generally kind and caring but has specific issues with his body hair. The author trims herself, but the boyfriend's hair is causing discomfort. The key point is the author setting a boundary regarding oral sex due to the hair. The boyfriend feels accused of being withholding and using sex as a bargaining chip, which he counters by saying he's willing to perform oral sex on her.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries in a relationship is generally acceptable. If the author is uncomfortable with something, communicating that and expecting changes is reasonable. However, using the withdrawal of a sexual act as a consequence might be seen as manipulative or holding sex as a bargaining chip. The boyfriend's response could also be problematic if he's not respecting her comfort level. But the question is specifically about the author's actions.\n\nThe author is stating her preference and setting a boundary. The issue is whether that's an ultimatum. Ultimatums can be a red flag in relationships, but sometimes they're necessary if one's needs aren't being met. However, the way it's framed here is that the author is using oral sex as a condition for the boyfriend to change his grooming habits. That could be seen as using sex as leverage, which might be considered manipulative. On the other hand, the author is simply expressing her physical comfort and expecting her partner to respect it. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also important. He's calling her withholding and using sex as a bargaining chip, but he's not addressing her legitimate discomfort. The author's issue is about her physical reaction to his hair, which is a valid concern. If the boyfriend is unwilling to trim his hair, perhaps the real issue is his lack of willingness to accommodate her needs.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, body hair preferences can be subjective. However, if one partner is uncomfortable with the other's grooming habits, it's reasonable to discuss it. The problem arises when one partner's needs are not respected. The author is making her needs known, but the method of using an ultimatum might be the point of contention here. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, possibly because they view the ultimatum as inappropriate. But another perspective is that the author is asserting her right to comfort and safety in intimacy. So, the answer depends on whether using a sexual act as a condition is considered wrong. If the author is simply asking for a change in behavior that affects her comfort, she's not entirely in the wrong. However, if the ultimatum is seen as manipulative, that could be the issue.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person set a boundary and whether the other party is respecting it. If the author is setting a boundary and the boyfriend is not respecting it, she might not be the asshole. But if she's using the withdrawal of sex as punishment without addressing it in a healthier way, maybe that's where the problem lies. However, in this case, the author is stating her physical discomfort, which is a legitimate reason. The boyfriend's response of saying he's the better person for performing oral on her might be deflecting from his own grooming habits and not addressing her valid concern.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. She's expressing her needs, and the boyfriend isn't respecting them. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
