(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for cutting off oral contact with her boyfriend due to his body hair.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that her boyfriend is otherwise loving and caring. However, he's insistent on her being clean-shaven, which she complies with. The issue arises with his own body hair, specifically the pubic area. She finds the coarse hair uncomfortable during oral sex and had an incident where she caught hairs in her teeth, leading her to set a boundary. The boyfriend reacts by accusing her of withholding sex and even continues to perform oral on her, which she finds unfair.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's discomfort is valid; physical discomfort can affect sexual intimacy. Setting a boundary to address this is a reasonable action. On the other hand, the boyfriend's insistence on her grooming while he maintains his own hair could be seen as double standards. However, the author is asking if she's in the wrong for enforcing her own comfort needs.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author communicated her issue and gave him a chance to adjust by trimming. When he refused and instead criticized her, she took a stand. It's important to note that she's not refusing all intimacy but a specific act that causes her distress. The boyfriend's reaction of seeing it as bargaining with sex might be dismissive of her legitimate concern.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to accommodate each other's needs. If the boyfriend is unwilling to adjust his grooming habits, that could be an issue. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her comfort, especially since she's already meeting his grooming expectations. The boyfriend's response seems dismissive and possibly controlling by suggesting he's being more generous by continuing oral sex. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. She's asserting her boundaries after a reasonable request. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem for not respecting her feelings and using guilt or manipulation.\n"
