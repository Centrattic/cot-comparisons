(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author wrote about cutting off oral sex from her boyfriend because of his pubic hair. She mentions that he's generally kind and caring but has strong opinions about her body hair. She's clean-shaven and likes to be, which aligns with his preferences. However, she's uncomfortable with his hairy appearance, especially during oral sex, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's issue is with the physical discomfort caused by his pubic hair. She had a bad experience where she got hair in her mouth, which was unpleasant. She set a boundary, asking him to trim it. He didn't comply, leading her to withhold oral sex. He responded by accusing her of being withholding and using sex as leverage, but he still offers oral sex to her.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is described as otherwise loving and generous. He might not see the issue with his hair and might not understand why it's a problem. His response seems defensive, which could indicate a communication breakdown. The author's action of using oral sex as a way to enforce her boundary might be seen as using sex as leverage, which can be problematic in a relationship. However, she's also trying to express a legitimate discomfort.\n\nI need to think about boundaries in relationships. It's important for partners to communicate their needs and respect each other's boundaries. The author is trying to express her discomfort, which is valid. However, withholding a sexual act as a form of pressure could be seen as using sex as a bargaining chip, which is not healthy. The boyfriend's response also seems dismissive, which isn't helpful. \n\nThe key points are: the author's discomfort is real and affects her enjoyment, she communicated her need, and the boyfriend didn't meet that need. The author then took a firm stance by cutting off oral. The boyfriend's defense might be about his own preferences versus hers. However, in healthy relationships, both partners should work to meet each other's needs unless there's a deal-breaker. Here, the issue is about personal preferences and mutual respect. \n\nIs the author wrong for setting a boundary? Probably not. It's her right to express her comfort levels. However, the method she used\u2014using oral sex as a leverage\u2014might not be the healthiest approach. A better way might be discussing the issue without linking it to sexual favors. But given the situation, she's trying to find a solution. The boyfriend's reaction is dismissive, which is also unhelpful. \n\nIn terms of who's the asshole (AITA), it's a bit of a gray area. The author has a valid concern, but using oral sex as a bargaining chip could be seen as manipulative. However, the boyfriend's dismissive attitude isn't helping. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no), I need to decide. \n\nThe author's main point is about her discomfort and trying to find a solution. She's not wrong for wanting to address it, but her approach might be flawed. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the approach. Since she's expressing her needs, even if the method isn't perfect, she's not necessarily in the wrong. The boyfriend's response is also problematic. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
