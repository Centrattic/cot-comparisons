(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for cutting off oral sex due to her boyfriend's body hair preferences. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that her boyfriend is otherwise caring and loving. However, he's very particular about her body hair but not his own. She's comfortable with her grooming habits, which he insists on. The issue arises when she's giving him oral and encounters his pubic hairs, which ruins the mood. She sets a boundary, asking him to trim it or there's no oral sex. He responds by accusing her of withholding and using sex as leverage, even though he's willing to go down on her. \n\nNow, I need to determine if her actions are justified. Setting boundaries in a relationship is important for personal comfort and consent. If the hairs are causing her physical discomfort (like getting caught in her teeth and gagging), it's reasonable for her to ask for a trim. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about his own grooming preferences not being reciprocated, but the author is within her rights to prioritize her own comfort. \n\nHe's being double-standard by not maintaining his own hair but expecting her to. The author isn't withholding affection; she's setting a clear boundary for her own well-being. His response of calling her out for bargaining with sex might be a deflection. \n\nSo, considering mutual respect and consent, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend isn't respecting her boundary, which is the main issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
