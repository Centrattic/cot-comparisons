(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the boyfriend has a lot of body hair, particularly in the pubic area, and the author is cutting him off from oral sex because they find it uncomfortable. The boyfriend is described as caring but has strong opinions about the author's hair, while he himself isn't as clean. The author can't handle the hair during oral and gave an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason for discomfort. Oral sex is a personal choice, and if the hair is causing physical discomfort or gagging, that's a legitimate issue. People have different preferences and boundaries. On the other hand, the boyfriend felt accused of being withholding, which might not be fair if the author is setting a boundary based on their own comfort.\n\nThe author might be seen as having a right to their own body and preferences. They're not forcing the boyfriend to do anything; they're just stating their own limits. The boyfriend's reaction of accusing her of bargaining with sex could be immature, but the author's action is about their own comfort. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have approached the situation differently. Instead of an ultimatum, discussing it and finding a compromise might have been better. But given the repeated issues and the last straw, the ultimatum might be necessary for their own well-being. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries. The boyfriend might need to adjust his grooming habits if he wants to maintain the sexual aspect of the relationship. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
