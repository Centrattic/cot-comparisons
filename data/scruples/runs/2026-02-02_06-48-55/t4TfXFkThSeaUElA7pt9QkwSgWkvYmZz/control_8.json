(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the boyfriend has a lot of body hair and the author is cutting him off from oral sex because of it. The boyfriend is described as otherwise kind and caring but has these specific opinions about the author's body hair, while he himself isn't as clean. The last incident was when she found pubic hairs in her teeth, leading her to set a boundary. He accused her of withholding sex and bargaining with it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is setting a boundary based on personal comfort. She's asking him to trim his hair, which seems reasonable. He responds by saying he'll still give her oral but she's being withholding. The question is whether her actions make her the asshole.\n\nBoundaries in relationships are important. If the author feels physically uncomfortable or it's affecting her enjoyment, she has the right to express that. However, using a no-oral-sex ultimatum might be seen as using sex as leverage. On the other hand, if the boyfriend isn't respecting her needs or is being dismissive, then she's justified. The boyfriend's reaction seems dismissive and maybe even a bit manipulative by pointing out he still gives her oral.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether her response was proportionate. Setting a boundary isn't wrong, but using sex as a bargaining chip can be seen as manipulative. However, in this case, she's setting a boundary for her comfort, which is valid. The boyfriend's response of accusing her of withholding and pointing out he still gives her oral might be trying to guilt-trip her. \n\nThe situation is about mutual respect and communication. If the boyfriend isn't open to compromising or addressing her concerns, that's on him. The author's decision to set a boundary isn't wrong, especially since she's communicated the issue. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic because he's not respecting her limits and is trying to shift blame.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her needs, which is healthy in a relationship. The boyfriend's response is dismissive and disrespectful. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
