(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking for an opinion on whether the person who wrote this AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is the one at fault.\n\nThe situation is about a couple where the boyfriend is not shaving or trimming his pubic hair, which is causing the author discomfort during oral sex. The author cut off oral sex and gave an ultimatum, which made the boyfriend accuse her of withholding and bargaining with sex. The boyfriend is described as otherwise caring, but he has strong opinions about her hair, which she takes care of, but he doesn't maintain his own. The last straw was finding pubic hairs in her teeth, leading to the conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main issue is about discomfort and hygiene during intimacy. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is accused of being inconsistent (he's okay with her maintaining hers but not his), and he's reacting negatively to her setting a boundary.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to communicate her discomfort but it seems like the boyfriend didn't take it seriously and instead turned it into an accusation. However, setting a boundary about personal hygiene, especially in intimate areas, is a common and reasonable request. The author isn't being unreasonable here. The boyfriend's reaction of accusing her of withholding sex might be a form of emotional manipulation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have approached the issue earlier or discussed it without immediately making an ultimatum. Maybe there's room for more open dialogue. But the core issue is about mutual respect and maintaining comfort during intimacy. If the boyfriend is unwilling to meet her basic hygiene expectation (trimming hair to avoid discomfort), then the author's stance is justified.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior of not maintaining his grooming could be a personal choice, but in a sexual relationship, partners often have mutual expectations. The author's action is about her own comfort, which is valid. The boyfriend's response seems to be deflecting blame rather than addressing her concern. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary that's important to her well-being and comfort in the relationship.\n"
