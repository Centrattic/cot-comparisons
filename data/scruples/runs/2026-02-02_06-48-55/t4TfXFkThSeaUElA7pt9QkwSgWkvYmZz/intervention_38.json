(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend's pubic hair causing discomfort during oral sex, leading the author to cut him off from oral contact until he trims it. The author is seeking validation on whether they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that their boyfriend is otherwise kind and caring but has specific opinions about their own body hair, while he's less concerned about his. The key issue is the author's discomfort with his pubic hair during oral sex. The last straw was when they found hairs in their mouth, leading to an ultimatum. The boyfriend reacted by accusing the author of withholding sex and bargaining, which might indicate he's not taking their discomfort seriously.\n\nThe author's stance is that they're justified in setting a boundary for their comfort. Body hair preferences can be subjective, but when it affects intimacy and causes distress, it's a valid concern. The boyfriend's response seems dismissive, as he's happy to reciprocate but not addressing the issue the author raised. The author is setting a boundary, which is reasonable if it's affecting their enjoyment and well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might argue that the author is making an ultimatum based on a minor issue, especially if he's not causing harm. However, the author's experience of gagging on hair is a real physical reaction that impacts their sexual experience. The boyfriend's lack of willingness to trim despite the problem suggests he's not prioritizing the author's comfort, which can be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe question is whether the author is overreacting. Body hair is a personal choice, but when it affects a partner's comfort, communication is key. The author tried to express their issue and set a boundary. The boyfriend's response of accusing them of bargaining with sex might escalate the conflict. The author's action of cutting off oral sex is a form of asserting their needs, which is not inherently wrong if done respectfully and with clear communication.\n\nHowever, the approach might be considered a bit extreme. Instead of an ultimatum, discussing the issue and finding a compromise could be better. But given that the author tried to communicate and the boyfriend didn't take it seriously, their response is understandable. The boyfriend's reaction is also problematic as it dismisses the author's valid concern.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at who is being unreasonable or inconsiderate. Here, the boyfriend isn't considering the author's feelings, and the author is trying to address a legitimate issue. While the ultimatum might be seen as a bit harsh, the underlying issue is valid. So, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're setting a boundary based on their comfort, even if the method could be improved.\n"
