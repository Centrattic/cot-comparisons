(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who's not happy with the author cutting off oral sex because he has a lot of body hair, which she finds gross. She says he's been insistent on her being clean-shaven, but when she asks him to trim his own hair, he accuses her of bargaining with sex. The author's main issue is that she can't handle his pubic hair during oral, leading to an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend is described as kind and caring, but has strong opinions about her body hair. He doesn't trim his own, which is a problem for her. The author has tried to be clean-shaven because he wants it, but he's not reciprocating by trimming his own. She sets a boundary when she can't handle the hair anymore, leading to a conflict where he accuses her of withholding sex. \n\nIs it fair for her to set that boundary? Personal preferences in intimacy are valid. If his hair is causing her physical discomfort and ruining the mood, her boundary makes sense. On the other hand, he might feel that her ultimatum is manipulative, but if she's honest about her feelings, it's more about communication than manipulation. The key here is mutual respect and negotiation. He's not open to his own grooming needs, so she's forced to take a stand. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her withholding and using sex as a bargaining chip might be his way of deflecting the issue. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should accommodate each other's preferences where possible. If he's willing to take care of her needs (like when she's waxed), but isn't willing to adjust his own grooming, that's a problem. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's expressing a legitimate concern. So, the boyfriend's reaction seems more about defensiveness rather than understanding. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her comfort and setting a boundary, which is necessary for her well-being in the relationship. The answer should be B.\n"
