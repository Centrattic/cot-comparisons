(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend is insistent on the author shaving their body hair, particularly in the pubic area. The author, however, is cutting off oral sex because the boyfriend's pubic hair makes it unpleasant for them. The boyfriend is accused of being \"weird\" about his own body hair but has a lot of opinions on the author's, and he even claims the author is being withholding by using sex as a bargaining tool.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions are justified. The main issue here is personal preference and boundaries in a relationship. The author is expressing discomfort with the boyfriend's grooming habits, which is affecting their intimacy. It's important to note that both partners have the right to set their own boundaries regarding physical intimacy. The author isn't rejecting the relationship entirely but is specifically addressing an aspect that's causing them distress. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about how he's being treated (accusing the author of withholding and using ultimatums) rather than addressing the author's valid concern. He's also highlighting that he's kind and generous, but the author's issue isn't about his treatment of them in other areas\u2014it's about their personal grooming. The author is not in the wrong for setting a boundary that's necessary for their comfort. The boyfriend should be open to discussing and finding a solution, like trimming his hair, to respect the author's preferences. \n\nThe question also asks if the author is juvenile for bringing this up at their age. While it might seem trivial to some, personal comfort in intimate acts is significant and shouldn't be dismissed as childish. The key point is whether the action is a reasonable boundary. Since the author is not being abusive or unreasonable, and they are communicating their needs, the answer would be that they are not in the wrong. The boyfriend's insensitivity to their preference might be the bigger issue here. So the answer is B.\n"
