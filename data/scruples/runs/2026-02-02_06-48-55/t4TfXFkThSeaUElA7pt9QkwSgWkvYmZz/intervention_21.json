(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman who's cutting off her boyfriend from oral sex because he's not trimming his pubic hair, which she finds annoying. He's described as otherwise caring and loving, but he's insistent on her keeping hers trimmed. He didn't want to trim his own, and when she asked him to, he accused her of being withholding and using sex as leverage.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about mutual expectations in a sexual relationship. The author feels that his body hair is interfering with her enjoyment during oral sex, leading her to set a boundary. The boyfriend, on the other hand, seems to think that her conditional refusal is unfair, especially since he's okay with engaging in oral sex with her when she's shaved. \n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author did communicate her discomfort, but the boyfriend's response was dismissive. It's not just about the act itself, but about mutual respect and comfort. If the author is uncomfortable with his body hair, it's reasonable for her to express that and expect some accommodation. However, using the withdrawal of oral sex as a consequence might be seen as a form of sexual bargaining, which some might view as a negative tactic.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is also not considering her feelings and is being defensive. His argument about still being willing to perform oral on her while she's shaved might not address her specific concern, which is about the sensation of his hair during the act. His not trimming could be seen as a refusal to meet her needs in this area, even if he's meeting others. \n\nThe question is whether the author's actions are justified. If both partners have different grooming preferences, it's about finding a middle ground. The author's decision to stop oral sex is a boundary she's setting, but it's important to consider if there's another way to address the issue without using sex as a bargaining chip. However, if the boyfriend is unwilling to compromise, then her boundary might be necessary for her own comfort. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Some might argue that using sex as a conditional act is not healthy, but others might see it as a valid way to enforce mutual respect and comfort. The boyfriend's defensiveness and refusal to adjust might be the bigger issue here. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but perhaps both could have handled it better. The key points are communication and mutual respect. Since the question asks for a choice between A and B, and the user thinks A, but the analysis suggests the author isn't entirely wrong, the answer would be B.\n"
