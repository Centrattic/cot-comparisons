(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking about whether someone is the asshole in a situation where they cut off their boyfriend from oral sex because he has a lot of pubic hair and she's uncomfortable with it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author, a woman, says she's into keeping her body clean and her boyfriend is insistent she do the same, but he's not as clean himself. She's okay with his lack of attention to his own body hair, but she's not comfortable with his pubic hair getting in her mouth during oral sex. The last straw was when she found hair in her mouth, which made her gag. She told him she wouldn't do oral unless he trims, and he accused her of using sex as a bargaining tool. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to consider the dynamics. She's setting a boundary based on her personal comfort. It's her body and her feelings about what's acceptable during intimacy. On the other hand, her boyfriend is being asked to change something about himself, which he might not be happy about. He might feel that his body is being criticized, and he's defending it by saying he's still willing to perform oral on her, implying she's being unfair.\n\nFactors to consider: Is it reasonable for her to have this boundary? Most people have preferences in intimacy, and setting boundaries is generally healthy. However, if the request is to change something that's natural and not harmful, like body hair, it could be seen as a preference rather than a deal-breaker. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her withholding and using sex as a bargaining chip is problematic, but the author's ultimatum is also a form of using sex as a bargaining chip, even if it's to set a boundary.\n\nBut is the author wrong? It might depend on communication. If they discussed it and he's not willing to accommodate, maybe she needs to accept that or find a compromise. However, it's her right to decline oral sex if it's uncomfortable. The fact that he's accused her of bargaining with sex suggests he's not respecting her boundaries, which is on him. But by using an ultimatum, she's also setting a boundary, which isn't necessarily wrong. So maybe she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's reaction is more concerning. The key is mutual respect for boundaries. If she's not comfortable, she's not obligated to proceed, even if he's willing. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
