(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a relationship where the boyfriend has a lot of body hair, particularly in the pubic area, and the author is cutting him off from oral sex because she doesn't like the hair getting in her mouth. She mentions that she told him to trim it or there would be no oral sex, and he responded by accusing her of withholding and bargaining with sex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid concern here. The presence of pubic hair can be a personal preference for some people, and she's clearly stating that it's ruining the mood and causing her physical discomfort, even gagging. That's a legitimate issue. On the other hand, her boyfriend is described as kind and caring, but he seems to have strong opinions about her hair, while not being as particular about his own until she brought it up. He's also using his willingness to reciprocate as a point of comparison, which might come off as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Cutting off a partner from a sexual activity they're offering is a form of withholding, which can be a sensitive topic. However, if the activity is causing her physical discomfort and she's communicated her needs, it's about boundaries and consent. She's not withholding affection or other forms of intimacy, just this specific act. Her request for him to trim his hair seems reasonable because it's about her comfort. The boyfriend's reaction of accusing her of bargaining with sex might be part of the problem, as he's not addressing her legitimate concern but instead framing it as a negotiation.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If she's made it clear that she's uncomfortable and he's not willing to accommodate, that's a conflict. But her standing firm on her needs isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way she presented her ultimatum might be seen as extreme, but given the discomfort, it's understandable. So, the key here is about mutual respect and communication. Since she's trying to set a boundary for her own comfort, and he's not respecting that by attacking her instead of addressing her request, the fault might lie more with him. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
