(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the boyfriend has a lot of body hair, especially in the pubic area, and the author is cutting him off from oral sex because of it. The boyfriend is accused of being insistent about her hair but not his own, and the last straw was finding hairs in her mouth.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author feels that the situation is affecting her comfort and enjoyment during intimacy. She's made a request for him to trim his hair, but he didn't comply and instead accused her of withholding sex. On the other hand, the boyfriend is described as otherwise caring and kind, but his body hair is an issue here.\n\nThe key points are about communication and mutual respect. The author is setting a boundary because of her discomfort, which is her right. However, cutting off oral sex as a form of ultimatum might be seen as using sex as leverage, which could be problematic. But if she's communicating her needs due to physical discomfort, that's different from just being withholding. \n\nThe boyfriend's response of accusing her of bargaining with sex might be dismissive of her legitimate concerns. Body hair is a personal choice, and unless it's causing him to be unhygienic, it's his choice to maintain. The author's issue is about her own comfort, which is valid. However, the method of response\u2014making an ultimatum\u2014could be seen as extreme. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe the author should have discussed her feelings more calmly before taking that step. But given that she tried to ask him to trim and he didn't comply, her reaction might be justified. The boyfriend not respecting her boundary by continuing not to trim could be the issue. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for setting a boundary. Since she's prioritizing her own comfort and health, it's not entirely her fault. However, using a sexual ultimatum could be seen as a form of punishment. But in this case, it's about comfort during intimacy. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's expressing her needs. The boyfriend might be in the wrong for not respecting her request and for his own response. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
