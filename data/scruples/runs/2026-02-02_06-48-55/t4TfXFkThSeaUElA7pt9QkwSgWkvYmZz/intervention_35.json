(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple dealing with body hair preferences. The author is a woman who's having issues with her boyfriend's pubic hair. She likes to be clean-shaven herself and finds his hair messy and distracting during oral sex. She set a boundary, asking him to trim his hair, and when he didn't, she cut off oral sex. He responded by saying she's withholding sex and that he's the better person because he still goes down on her. She's asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid reason for her discomfort. She's clear that she's not into his body hair and it's affecting her enjoyment. She communicated her needs, which is a healthy step. Setting boundaries in a relationship is important for mutual respect. The boyfriend, on the other hand, didn't meet her request, which led to her taking action. But he also seems to be making her feel guilty by calling her withholding and using reverse psychology about his own actions.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author tried to communicate her needs, which is her right. The boyfriend's response was dismissive and possibly even manipulative, which isn't healthy. The fact that he's being defensive and not willing to compromise might indicate that he's the one not respecting her boundaries. The author's action of cutting off oral sex is a form of withholding a sexual act based on a personal boundary. However, using sex as leverage can be problematic if it's not mutual. If the boyfriend is okay with continuing to perform oral sex without her reciprocating, that might be an issue of imbalance. \n\nBut the author's main issue is about her own comfort. She's not refusing all sexual activity, just one specific act that she finds unpleasant. It's important to note that everyone has different preferences, and it's okay to set limits as long as it's communicated clearly. The boyfriend's reaction, however, seems to be about control and guilt-tripping, which isn't healthy. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The author did her part by stating her needs. If the boyfriend isn't willing to accommodate a reasonable request (trimming hair), then perhaps the issue is his unwillingness to meet her halfway. The author isn't wrong for wanting her partner to adjust for her comfort. It's a mutual effort. If he can't accept that, maybe there's a deeper issue in the relationship about respect and compromise.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She communicated her needs, which is a healthy part of any relationship. The boyfriend's response is more concerning because he's not respecting her boundaries and is using guilt to manipulate her. The problem isn't the author's request but the boyfriend's reaction and lack of willingness to comply.\n"
