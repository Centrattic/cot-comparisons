(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple having a disagreement over body hair, specifically pubic hair. The author is a woman who's cutting off oral sex because her boyfriend's pubic hair is causing her discomfort. She mentions that he's generally a caring person but is weird about her body hair. He doesn't take care of his own hair much, and now she's had enough after finding hairs in her mouth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider mutual respect and communication in relationships. The author is setting a boundary because his body hair is affecting her comfort during intimacy. That seems like a valid reason. However, by cutting off oral sex as a form of ultimatum, is that a fair action? Some might say that using sex as a bargaining chip can be problematic, but others might see it as a necessary boundary to protect her own comfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems to be that he's being accused of being withholding, but he's still willing to reciprocate. He might feel that his preferences aren't being respected as much as hers are. The author also mentions she's okay with her own grooming but not his, which could indicate a double standard. But his grooming habits are causing her distress, which is a personal issue she's dealing with.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author's action is about her own comfort, but the way she's enforcing it (by cutting off oral sex) might be seen as a form of punishment or withholding affection, which could be a point of contention. However, if the discomfort is genuine and she's communicated it, setting that boundary might be reasonable. The boyfriend's response of accusing her of bargaining with sex suggests he might not take her feelings seriously, which could be part of the problem.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should strive to meet each other's needs, but there's also the aspect of personal preferences. The author isn't wrong for having her own boundaries, but maybe the way she's handling it could be improved with more discussion rather than an ultimatum. However, given that she tried to communicate and it didn't work, her decision to set a boundary isn't necessarily wrong. The boyfriend's reaction might indicate a lack of empathy towards her feelings, which could imply he's more at fault. So, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
