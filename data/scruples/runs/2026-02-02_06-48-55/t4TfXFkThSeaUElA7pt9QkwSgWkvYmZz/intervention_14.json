(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for cutting off oral sex because their boyfriend's pubic hair is causing issues. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that their boyfriend is otherwise caring and loving, but he's very strict about her body hair, yet he himself has a lot of pubic hair that's causing problems. The last straw was finding hairs in her mouth, which led to her giving an ultimatum. The boyfriend responded by accusing her of withholding sex and even though he's okay with giving oral to her, he seems to think he's the better person.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they have a valid physical discomfort. Finding hairs in their mouth and gagging is a real issue. They're also trying to communicate their needs, which is a mature approach. However, cutting off oral sex as a punishment might be seen as using sex as leverage, which can be problematic in a relationship. The boyfriend's response, while maybe a bit defensive, is also about his own preferences and willingness to compromise.\n\nThe boyfriend's insistence on her trimming her hair but not addressing his own hair could be a double standard. The author might feel that their own grooming standards are being respected, but their partner's aren't. However, the author's decision to stop oral sex might be seen as withholding a part of intimacy, which can create tension. It's important to have open communication and find a compromise, like trimming or waxing, but using sex as a bargaining chip can lead to negative dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to express their discomfort and set boundaries. The key here is whether the author's method of addressing the issue is appropriate. Ultimatums can be effective if both parties are open to change, but they can also create resentment. The boyfriend's reaction of feeling accused and defensive might be because he perceives her as using sex to control the situation, which is a common point of conflict in relationships.\n\nIn terms of age, the author mentions they're sorry to have this issue at their age, which might suggest they're in a long-term relationship where expectations have shifted. The boyfriend's behavior of still going down on her despite her ultimatum shows he's trying to accommodate her, but maybe not addressing the root of the problem.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're communicating a legitimate issue and setting boundaries, which is healthy. However, using the withholding of oral sex might be seen as a form of punishment rather than a collaborative problem-solving approach. The boyfriend's response, while defensive, also shows a lack of willingness to fully address the issue. Both sides have valid points, but the question is about who is more in the wrong. Since the author is standing up for their physical comfort and setting boundaries, which is reasonable, and the boyfriend's reaction is dismissive and possibly defensive, I think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. They're trying to find a solution but are met with resistance. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
