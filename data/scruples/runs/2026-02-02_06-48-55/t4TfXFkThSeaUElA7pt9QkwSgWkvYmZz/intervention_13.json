(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a relationship where the boyfriend has a lot of body hair, especially in the pubic area, and the author is cutting off oral sex because of it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that her boyfriend is generally loving and caring, but he's really strict about her body hair, yet he himself has a lot of hair that's causing her discomfort. She tried to tell him she can't handle the hair during oral, and he responded by accusing her of being withholding and pointing out that he still gives her oral. She's now cutting off oral as an ultimatum.\n\nFrom what I can see, the author is setting a boundary because of her personal discomfort. That seems reasonable. People have different preferences in intimacy, and it's okay to communicate those. However, the way she's handling it by cutting off oral completely might be seen as an ultimatum, which can be a bit extreme. But maybe it's a valid way to set a boundary if she's really uncomfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is being criticized for his own body hair but is also expecting her to be clean-shaven. There's a bit of a double standard here. He's not addressing his own grooming habits as per her request, which is causing the issue.\n\nThe key points are: the author is uncomfortable with his body hair, has communicated her needs, and he isn't meeting her halfway. She's now cutting off oral until he trims. The boyfriend is being defensive and not addressing the problem she raised. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. She's advocating for her own comfort and trying to resolve the issue. The boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries and is making excuses. The author's action seems like a reasonable boundary, though maybe there's a way to approach it more constructively. But in terms of who's in the wrong, the boyfriend isn't addressing her valid concern, so the author isn't the asshole here. The answer is B.\n"
