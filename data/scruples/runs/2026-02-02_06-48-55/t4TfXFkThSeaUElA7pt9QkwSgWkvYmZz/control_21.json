(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a boyfriend who's upset because his partner has pubic hair that's causing her to gag during oral sex. She's cut off oral contact because of it, and he's accused her of withholding sex. She's asking if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clear that her boyfriend is otherwise caring and loving. The issue is specifically about his body hair. He doesn't mind his own hair but is insistent she keeps hers trimmed. Now, she's having a problem with his hair during oral sex, leading her to set a boundary. He's upset, calling her withholding and using sex as a bargaining chip, while she says he's a mess and she's perfect.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The author is setting a boundary because of her comfort, which is valid. Everyone has different preferences, and if something is causing physical discomfort or revulsion, it's reasonable to ask for changes. The boyfriend's response\u2014accusing her of bargaining with sex and implying he's the better partner because he goes down on her\u2014seems dismissive of her valid concern. He's not addressing the issue she raised but instead attacking her.\n\nBody hair is a personal choice, but when it affects the other person's comfort in intimacy, it's a matter of communication and compromise. The author is asking him to trim his hair, which is a reasonable request. His refusal and the ultimatum she's given are both part of the conflict. Since she's the one experiencing the discomfort, and he's not willing to accommodate her needs, it's more about his unwillingness to compromise. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's acting in her own comfort and health (avoiding gagging), and he's not respecting her boundary, she's justified in setting that limit. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic because he's using emotional manipulation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the issue lies with his inability to meet her reasonable request.\n"
