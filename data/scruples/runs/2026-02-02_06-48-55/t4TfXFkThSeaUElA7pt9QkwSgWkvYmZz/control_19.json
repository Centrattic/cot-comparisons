(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who's not happy with the author cutting off oral because he has a lot of body hair. The author says he's otherwise a good partner but this one issue is a dealbreaker for her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author feels that the hair is causing her physical discomfort and ruining the mood. She's asked him to trim it but he refused, leading to the ultimatum. He's now upset, saying she's being withholding and using sex as a bargaining chip. \n\nIs her request reasonable? Personal grooming preferences can be subjective. If she's uncomfortable, it's her right to express that. But maybe she should have communicated better earlier instead of waiting until an ultimatum. However, the boyfriend's reaction also matters. If he's being defensive and not considering her feelings, that's a problem. \n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. Since she's setting boundaries for her own comfort, I think she's justified. The boyfriend's reaction might be the real issue here. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
