(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is a woman who's in a relationship with her boyfriend. She's decided to stop giving him oral sex because she's uncomfortable with his pubic hair. She mentions that he's otherwise a good partner, but he's very particular about her hair being clean-shaven but doesn't take care of his own. She had an incident where she felt hairs in her mouth and gagged, leading her to set a boundary. He responded by calling her withholding and using sex as leverage, and she's now cutting off oral sex as a result.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend is being critical of her hair but not maintaining his own. The author is now setting a boundary based on her comfort. But she's using a sexual favor as a condition for him to trim his hair. That's where the potential issue lies. Setting boundaries is okay, but using sex as a bargaining chip can be seen as manipulative or conditional, which might not be healthy. However, she's also expressing her needs, which is valid. The boyfriend's response was to accuse her of bargaining, which is a problem. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's using oral sex as leverage to make him change his grooming habits, that could be seen as crossing a line. On the other hand, if she's simply stating her needs and boundaries, it's her right. The key is whether she's making a reasonable boundary or using sex to control his behavior. Since she's the one setting the boundary based on her own discomfort, it's not necessarily wrong. But if she's using it as punishment or blackmail, that's different. The situation is complex, but I think she's within her rights to express her needs, even if the method is a bit conditional. So the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
