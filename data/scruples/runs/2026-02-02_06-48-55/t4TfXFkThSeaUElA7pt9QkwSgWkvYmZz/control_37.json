(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off oral sex with her boyfriend because of his body hair. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe boyfriend is described as loving and caring, but he has issues with the author's body hair, making her trim or shave. However, he doesn't take care of his own body hair, especially down there. The author finds his hair problematic during oral sex, to the point where she caught hairs in her teeth and gagged. She set a boundary, asking him to trim it or she'd stop oral sex. He accused her of withholding sex and bargaining, even though he's willing to perform oral on her.\n\nSo, the key points here are boundaries and mutual respect. The author is setting a personal boundary based on her comfort. She's not the one with the issue; it's his grooming habits affecting her experience. He's being defensive and not respecting her limits. He's also pointing out her grooming habits but not addressing his own. The situation seems more about his lack of self-care and not respecting her needs. The author is acting within her right to set boundaries, so she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
