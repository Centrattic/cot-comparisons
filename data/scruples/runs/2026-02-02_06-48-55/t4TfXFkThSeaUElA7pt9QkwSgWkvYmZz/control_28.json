(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a relationship where the boyfriend has a lot of body hair, especially down there, which the author finds off-putting. The author decided to cut off oral sex unless he trims his hair. The boyfriend is upset, calling her withholding and using sex as a bargaining tool, while she argues that his hair is making her uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here involve mutual respect, communication, and consent in a relationship. The author is expressing a personal preference about their partner's grooming habits. It's her body and her comfort, so she has the right to set boundaries. However, using the withdrawal of oral sex as a demand could be seen as manipulative or using sex as a bargaining chip, which some might view negatively.\n\nOn the other hand, if the boyfriend is not paying attention to his grooming and is resistant to change, that could also be a problem. The author's discomfort is valid, and it's reasonable for her to communicate that. The boyfriend's response, however, seems dismissive and possibly disrespectful, as he's framing her actions as withholding rather than addressing her legitimate concerns.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If she's being unreasonable with her ultimatum, then it's A. If she's standing up for her comfort and communicating her needs, then it's B. The line between setting boundaries and using sex as leverage can be blurry. However, in consensual relationships, individuals have the right to express their preferences. The boyfriend's accusation that she's bargaining with sex might be a defense mechanism if he's unwilling to compromise. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting this boundary, especially if the hair is causing her physical discomfort. The boyfriend's reaction seems to lack empathy. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
