(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author cutting off oral sex for their boyfriend because he has a lot of pubic hair, which they find uncomfortable. The boyfriend is described as otherwise kind and loving, but he's insistent on the author's grooming while his own hair is causing issues.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The author mentions they told their boyfriend about the issue, but he responded by accusing her of withholding and bargaining with sex. That's a red flag because he's dismissing her valid concern and turning it into a criticism of her. His reaction isn't helpful, and it shows he's not taking her comfort seriously.\n\nThe author's request for him to trim his hair is about her physical comfort and the act of intimacy. It's reasonable for someone to have preferences about their sexual experiences. The boyfriend's refusal to accommodate that, and instead using the situation to imply she's being unfair, suggests he's not respecting her boundaries.\n\nHowever, the author is making a choice to cut off oral sex as a consequence. While it's their right to set boundaries, using the withdrawal of a sexual act as a punishment might be seen as leveraging intimacy, which can be a sensitive area. But in this case, the act of oral sex is part of their intimacy, and if it's causing distress, the author's stance is about maintaining her comfort. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since the issue is causing genuine discomfort and the boyfriend isn't addressing it respectfully, the author's position might be justified.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is using this as a way to pressure him into changing, it could be seen as manipulation. But given the context, the problem is real, and the author is trying to communicate it. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic because he's not listening and is being defensive. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. The boyfriend's response is the bigger issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
