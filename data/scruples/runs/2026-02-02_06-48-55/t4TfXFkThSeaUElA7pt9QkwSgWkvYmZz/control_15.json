(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend who's upset because the author has stopped giving him oral sex due to his pubic hair. The author explains that she finds his hair unruly and it's affecting the mood, especially when she caught some hairs in her teeth. She gave him an ultimatum to trim or there's no oral. He responded by accusing her of withholding and mentioned he's willing to reciprocate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a valid personal discomfort with the hair, which is a physical aspect that's affecting her enjoyment. She's communicating her needs and boundaries, which is important in a relationship. On the other hand, the boyfriend feels hurt and accused, thinking she's using sex as a bargaining chip. He's willing to continue giving oral, which might be a point in his favor, but he's not addressing her specific issue about the hair.\n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable here. Personal grooming preferences are subjective, and it's her right to express that she's not comfortable with his current grooming habits. The boyfriend's reaction seems dismissive of her feelings, focusing instead on his own contributions. The ultimatum is a form of setting a boundary, which is okay if there's mutual respect. However, the key is whether the author's action is justified. Since she's given him a clear request to change something that affects her directly, and he's not taking it seriously, she's acting in her own self-interest. The boyfriend's response of accusing her of bargaining is a deflection.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to address the issue, and when it wasn't resolved, she set a boundary. The boyfriend's inability to meet her request and his defensive reaction might indicate a lack of empathy. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing her comfort. So the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
