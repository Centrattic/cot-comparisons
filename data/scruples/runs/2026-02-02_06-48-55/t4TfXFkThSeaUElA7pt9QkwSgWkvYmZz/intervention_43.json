(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is at fault. The situation is about a boyfriend who doesn't trim his pubic hair enough, leading the author to stop giving him oral sex. The boyfriend is described as otherwise caring and generous, but this specific issue is causing a problem.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author says she's clean-shaven, and he doesn't trim as much. She can't stand the hair getting in her mouth and gagged once. She set a boundary, telling him to trim or she won't perform oral. He responded by calling her withholding and using sex as a bargaining chip, which she finds unfair. He's still willing to give her oral, but she's not willing to do the same because of his hair.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, boundaries in relationships are important. If something is uncomfortable for her, it's her right to set a limit. The problem might be how she communicated it. She used an ultimatum, which can be seen as a form of withholding sex, which he argues is bargaining. But he's also not trimming, which she finds unhygienic or unappealing. \n\nOn the other hand, he's willing to meet her halfway by taking care of her area when she's waxed, showing he's considerate. However, he's not adjusting for her preferences. Maybe he's not listening to her needs. But she's setting a boundary that affects his ability to receive oral sex, which he might see as unfair since he's still offering to give it. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The key points are mutual respect and communication. If she's uncomfortable, she's not wrong to set a boundary. But maybe she should have discussed it earlier or found a compromise. However, the boyfriend's reaction also seems defensive and dismissive. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because she's expressing her needs and setting a boundary. The boyfriend's issue is not respecting her hygiene preferences. So, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
