(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple where the boyfriend has a lot of body hair, especially down there, and the author is upset because she can't do oral sex on him because of the hair. She says she told him she's cutting off oral unless he trims, and he accused her of being withholding and using sex as a bargaining tool.\n\nFirst, I need to think about consent and mutual respect in a relationship. Both partners should feel comfortable and respected. The author is expressing a personal preference that affects her comfort during intimacy. She's not refusing sex entirely, just oral, which is a specific act. She's setting a boundary based on her physical comfort, which seems reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is upset because she's setting this boundary and is using it as a condition for oral sex. He feels she's bargaining with sex, which he might see as unfair. But from her perspective, she's trying to communicate her needs. The problem might be how the ultimatum is framed. Instead of an ultimatum, could she have discussed it more collaboratively?\n\nHowever, the key point is that she's making a choice based on her own comfort. It's not about him being unclean in a health sense but her personal preference. The boyfriend's reaction is also valid because he feels judged about his body hair. Body image issues can be sensitive, and he might feel she's imposing her standards on him.\n\nBut in the context of a relationship, partners often adjust for each other's preferences. If she's comfortable with other aspects of intimacy but this one is a deal-breaker, then her stance isn't unreasonable. The fact that he's kind and generous in other ways doesn't negate her right to set this boundary. The issue here is mutual adjustment. If he's not willing to trim, maybe they need to find a compromise, but she's not wrong for wanting to set that limit. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's advocating for her own comfort, which is important. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling judged, but her right to set boundaries is valid. Therefore, answer B.\n"
