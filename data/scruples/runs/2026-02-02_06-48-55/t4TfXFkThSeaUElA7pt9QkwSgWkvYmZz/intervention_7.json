(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off oral sex from her boyfriend because he has a lot of pubic hair and she finds it unappealing. The situation is about a personal preference leading to a relationship issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clear that her boyfriend is otherwise loving and caring. The issue is his body hair, specifically pubic hair, which she finds distracting or unpleasant. She tried to communicate her discomfort, leading to an argument where he accused her of withholding sex. She then set a boundary, saying he needs to trim his hair or she won't perform oral sex anymore. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, personal preferences in the bedroom are subjective. The boyfriend's hair is a physical attribute he may not control directly, but he's already making an effort with his beard and other body hair. The author's request is about something she's uncomfortable with, which is valid. However, using oral sex as a bargaining tool could be seen as using sex as a weapon, which is a negative thing in relationships. \n\nBut then again, setting boundaries in intimacy is important. If something is causing physical discomfort (like finding hairs in her teeth), it's reasonable to address it. The boyfriend's reaction might be dismissive, as he's comparing his actions to hers, which might be part of the problem. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author did communicate her issue, and the boyfriend's response was defensive. Whether she's in the wrong depends on whether her action (withholding oral sex) is a reasonable boundary or a form of manipulation. Since she's not withholding all intimacy but a specific act due to a personal preference, it's more about her comfort. However, ultimatums can be problematic. \n\nBut the question is about the author being in the wrong. If the boyfriend isn't receptive to her needs and their communication isn't resolving the issue, her decision might be justified. So maybe the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. However, using oral sex as a condition could be seen as manipulative. But given the context of personal preference and discomfort, it's more about setting a boundary. So the answer is B.\n"
