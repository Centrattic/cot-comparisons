(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author, a woman, is cutting off oral sex from her boyfriend because she's uncomfortable with his pubic hair being in her mouth. She mentions that he's a caring person but has strict opinions about her body hair, yet he's not as clean in that area. The last incident was when she found hair in her mouth, which made her gag, leading her to set a boundary.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if her actions are justified. She's stating her personal boundaries, which is a valid thing in a relationship. Everyone has different preferences and comfort levels. The boyfriend is being inconsistent, as he comments on her hair but isn't maintaining his own. The author isn't being unfair by asking him to trim for her comfort. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, accusing her of withholding sex, might be part of the issue. Using sex as a bargaining chip can be problematic. The author is setting a boundary, not punishing him for other reasons. Her ultimatum is about her own comfort. \n\nThere's no indication she's wrong for setting this limit. Relationships require communication and mutual respect for each other's boundaries. Since she's trying to address a specific issue that affects her, she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's response might be the issue here, not her decision to set the boundary. So, the answer should be B.\n"
