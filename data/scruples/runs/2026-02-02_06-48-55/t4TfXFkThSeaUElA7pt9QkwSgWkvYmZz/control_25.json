(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for cutting off oral sex from her boyfriend because he has a lot of body hair and she found hairs in her mouth. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions that her boyfriend is generally loving and caring but has strong opinions about her body hair, which she keeps clean. However, he doesn't take care of his own, leading to her discomfort during oral sex. She set a boundary, which he didn't take well, accusing her of withholding sex and bargaining.\n\nNow, considering consent and personal boundaries. In any relationship, both partners have the right to set boundaries about what they're comfortable doing. If one partner is uncomfortable with a certain aspect of the other's body, it's reasonable to communicate that. The author isn't refusing all intimacy, just oral sex specifically due to a specific reason. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be about control or not respecting her boundaries. He calls her withholding, but she's stating her physical discomfort as a reason. It's important to note that using sex as a bargaining chip isn't healthy. The author is not in the wrong for setting a boundary that affects her own comfort and health. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance. If the author is using this as a way to pressure him into changing his natural state without room for compromise, that could be an issue. But the problem here is the physical discomfort and lack of hygiene from his side. Also, the term \"ultimatums\" is used, which might suggest she's not open to discussion. But given the situation, it's a personal hygiene issue she's addressing. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, body hair is natural, but personal preferences vary. The boyfriend's insistence on her shaving but not himself could be a double standard, which the author is now pointing out. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's communicating her needs and boundaries, which is a healthy part of a relationship. The boyfriend not respecting that and using guilt trips is the issue. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
