(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for cutting off oral sex due to their boyfriend's body hair preferences.\n\nFirst, the key points from the situation: The author's boyfriend is generally caring and loving but has specific opinions about the author's body hair, while his own is described as \"unruly jungle.\" The author is upset about pubic hairs getting caught in her teeth during oral sex, leading her to set a boundary. The boyfriend accused her of being withholding and using sex as leverage.\n\nNow, considering consent and communication in relationships. The author has a right to their own comfort and boundaries. If something is causing physical discomfort (like hairs getting stuck), it's reasonable to express that. The boyfriend's response of accusing her of bargaining with sex might indicate a lack of understanding or respect for her feelings. However, setting a boundary around sexual activity is a personal choice and not inherently wrong if communicated consensually.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction suggests he felt the ultimatum was unfair, which can be a valid point if the boundary is non-negotiable without discussion. But the author's issue is about her physical comfort, which is a legitimate concern. The problem might also stem from differing expectations regarding body hair maintenance. The author might benefit from discussing this with him to find a middle ground rather than an ultimatum, but the act of setting a boundary itself isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nConsidering cultural and societal norms, body hair preferences vary, and there's no one-size-fits-all. The key here is mutual respect. If the author is clear about her needs without coercion, she's in her right. However, if the boyfriend feels pressured or used, that's a separate issue. The author's action is about her own comfort, so unless she's using it as a manipulative tactic, she's not the one at fault. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
