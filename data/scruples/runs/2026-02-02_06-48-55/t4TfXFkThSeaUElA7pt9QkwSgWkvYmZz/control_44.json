(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The main issue here is about body hair preferences in a relationship. The author, a woman, is cutting off her boyfriend from oral sex because he's not trimming his pubic hair, which she finds unappealing. The boyfriend, on the other hand, is insistent on her being clean but not the other way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that she's uncomfortable with his hair, leading to a negative experience during intimacy. Her boyfriend, while kind in other aspects, is pushing back against her request, even accusing her of withholding sex. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author has communicated her feelings and set a boundary, which is her right. However, the boyfriend's reaction\u2014accusing her of bargaining with sex\u2014might be problematic. He's choosing to engage in other forms of intimacy but not respecting her boundary regarding oral sex. That could indicate a lack of empathy or understanding on his part.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, everyone has preferences about intimacy. The author isn't wrong for having her own standards. However, setting an ultimatum can be a heavy approach. Maybe a more constructive dialogue could have been pursued first. But given that she's already tried to communicate and faced resistance, her decision to enforce a boundary isn't unreasonable. The boyfriend's response, however, might be more indicative of the issue here. He's not respecting her comfort level, which is a red flag.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is crucial. The author is asserting her needs, which is valid. The boyfriend's lack of flexibility, especially when he's the one causing discomfort, might place the blame on him. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing her comfort, even if the topic is trivial to some. It's a personal preference and part of consent in intimacy.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. Her actions are about setting healthy boundaries, which is important in any relationship. The boyfriend's reaction is the issue here, not her decision to enforce her comfort level.\n"
