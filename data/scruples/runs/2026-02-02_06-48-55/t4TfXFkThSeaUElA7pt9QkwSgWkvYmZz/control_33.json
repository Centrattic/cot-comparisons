(look at my username) .. things aren't peachy down there.\nLet me get this straight, 100%, my bf is otherwise a loving and caring person. But he's weird about his body hair. He doesn't really pay too much attention to it, beard or otherwise. Strangely enough, he has a lot of opinions on mine. It's lucky that I like to be clean myself because he seems weirdly insistent on me trimming or shaving hair with no margin for any slack. He's a kind and generous lover too (he loves to take care of things downstairs especially when I'm freshly waxed), but while I love giving him oral, there are so many instances when his unruly jungle is killing the mood. \n\nThe last straw came a week back when I caught not one, but a clunk of three pubic hairs (gah!) in my teeth and nearly gagged at the feeling of it. I told him I can't deal with this and he has to at least fucking trim it or there's on oral. He ended up accusing me of being withholding and bargaining with sex. He retorted with how he's the better person because he'll still go down on me. Gaaaah!  But I'm mostly perfect down there and inviting. He's a mess. \n\nI know this is juvenile nonsense and I'm sorry to have this at my age, but in almost all aspects he's amazing. He's just a little too hairy and now I can't help but give out ultimatums. Who is the asshole here and what should I do to be smarter about this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend's body hair, specifically the author being uncomfortable with his pubic hair during oral sex. She's cutting him off from oral because of it, and he's upset, saying she's withholding sex and bargaining with it. The question is whether she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate concern about discomfort during intimacy. She's not happy with his hair and it's affecting their physical relationship. On the other hand, the boyfriend is upset that she's using oral sex as a condition for him to trim his hair. He's also pointing out that he's willing to continue giving her oral sex even with his \"jungle,\" which he sees as more generous.\n\nBut wait, the author isn't withholding all sex, just oral. She's not saying they can't have other types of intimacy. The problem is specifically about her comfort during oral. Body hair preferences are common, and people often have different standards. The boyfriend's insistence on her maintaining hers but not on him maintaining his might be a double standard. Also, when she asked him to trim, he accused her of bargaining with sex. That seems like he's not taking her discomfort seriously. \n\nIs it fair for her to set a boundary? If she's uncomfortable, setting a boundary is reasonable. However, the way she's doing it by cutting off oral entirely might be seen as extreme. Maybe she could have communicated it more gently or offered alternatives. But given the situation, her reaction isn't entirely unreasonable. The boyfriend's response of accusing her of withholding and using that as a weapon might be part of the problem. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Both need to talk about their needs and boundaries without using ultimatums or guilt-tripping. But the author's main issue is her own comfort, which is valid. The boyfriend's reaction might be more about feeling blamed rather than addressing her actual concern. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not. She's expressing her needs, even if the method could be improved. The boyfriend's response is also problematic. The answer might be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
