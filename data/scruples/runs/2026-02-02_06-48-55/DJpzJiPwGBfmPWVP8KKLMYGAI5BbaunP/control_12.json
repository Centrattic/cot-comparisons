I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed about giving up their seat at the bus stop. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nSo the author is a pregnant student who has a long commute. They took a seat at the bus station, then an elderly woman told another woman to take the author's seat. The author, feeling embarrassed, gave up the seat even though their pregnancy wasn't visible when sitting. They're annoyed at the elderly woman for shaming them into giving up the seat, not the woman who took the seat. The question is whether the author is wrong for being annoyed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable, especially after a long day. Public transportation seats are often in demand, and people usually offer seats to those in need. But the author took a seat first, then another person was invited to take it. The author felt pressured to give it up even though they needed it. \n\nThe key points here are: the author's right to the seat, the elderly woman's action of shaming, and the author's response. The author isn't angry at the woman who took the seat, just at the one who made them feel bad. The author mentions they would offer their seat to someone else if needed, but in this case, they felt they had a legitimate need.\n\nIn many societies, there's an unspoken rule to offer seats to those who need them more, like elderly, pregnant, or disabled people. However, if someone is already sitting and someone else comes in and is told to take their seat by another passenger, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's pregnancy wasn't obvious until standing, which might have led to the confusion. The elderly woman might have thought the standing woman needed the seat more, not realizing the author's condition.\n\nIs the author wrong for being annoyed? Well, they had the right to the seat they took first. The elderly woman's action could be seen as inappropriate, as she didn't know the author's situation. The author's annoyance at being shamed is understandable. They didn't act confrontationally, just gave up the seat to avoid conflict, which is a common response when one doesn't want to cause trouble. Their right to the seat isn't in question, and the situation might have been a misunderstanding. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
