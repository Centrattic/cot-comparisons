I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a pregnant woman giving up her seat at a bus station to an older woman, but then feeling annoyed because an elderly woman next to her shamed her into giving up the seat to another woman who wasn't in obvious distress.\n\nFirst, the author is pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable, especially after a long day of walking and commuting. She mentions being 5 months pregnant, so her belly isn't visible when sitting but becomes noticeable when standing. That's a key detail. When she sat down, the elderly woman next to her gestured for her to give the seat to another woman. The author complied but felt wronged.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The main factors here are the context of her situation and the actions of the elderly woman. The bus station seats were all free initially, and she took one. Then others, including the elderly woman, sat down. The other woman wasn't showing any signs of needing the seat. The elderly woman's behavior\u2014pointing and telling her to give up the seat\u2014might have been unwarranted, especially since the author was in a vulnerable state (pregnant, tired from a long commute).\n\nThe author isn't upset with the woman who took the seat but with the one who pressured her. She also mentions she's usually considerate and would offer her seat if someone needed it more. The elderly woman's action might have been based on a misunderstanding or incorrect assumption. The author's annoyance is justified because she was in a situation where standing would be harder for her, and the pressure was unnecessary. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
