I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author is a pregnant woman who took a seat at the bus station, and after an elderly woman told her to give it up for another woman, she did so. Now she's annoyed and wants to know if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable, especially after a long commute. She took a seat that was free when she arrived, and others, including an elderly woman, sat next to her. Then another woman stood nearby. The elderly woman told her to give up the seat, and the author did, even though she was pregnant. The key points here are the author's physical condition and the social norms around giving up seats.\n\nPregnancy can be physically taxing, so it's reasonable for someone to want to sit if they're exhausted. However, in many public places, there's an unspoken etiquette where people might give up seats for those who are elderly, disabled, or in obvious distress. The author mentions that her pregnancy wasn't visible until she stood up, so maybe the other woman didn't realize she was pregnant. The elderly woman might have thought the other woman needed the seat more, perhaps because she was standing longer or looked older. \n\nThe author didn't confront the elderly woman, just gave up the seat. She's annoyed because she felt shamed into it. But was she in the wrong? Well, she was using the seat when it was available, and there's no rule that a pregnant person must keep the seat. However, the elderly woman might have had a different perspective, thinking the other woman needed it more. \n\nThe author says she usually offers her seat to others, which shows she's considerate. But in this case, she might have thought she needed it more due to her condition. The key is that the elderly woman's action was based on her perception of who needed the seat more. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she had a legitimate reason to sit. The elderly woman might have made an assumption, but the author could have calmly explained her situation. Since she did offer the seat and didn't cause an argument, she's probably not the asshole. So the answer is B.\n"
