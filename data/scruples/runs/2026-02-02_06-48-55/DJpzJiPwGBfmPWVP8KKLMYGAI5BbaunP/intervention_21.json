I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a pregnant woman at a bus station who gave up her seat to an elderly woman's request, even though there were other seats available. The woman is annoyed about having to do this and is questioning if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman is pregnant and her belly is noticeable when she stands, which might make standing uncomfortable. She had taken a seat because she's exhausted from a long commute. The elderly woman next to her then tells the other woman to take her seat. The woman gives up her seat but feels shamed and is now upset.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she might be, but I need to analyze. \n\nPublic transport etiquette usually encourages offering seats to those who need them more. However, in this case, she was already sitting in a seat when it was available. The elderly woman's request might have been based on a misunderstanding or a cultural norm. The woman in question is pregnant, which could be a valid reason to keep the seat. However, since her pregnancy wasn't visible when sitting, others might not know she's pregnant until she stands up. \n\nThe woman gave up the seat without confrontation, which is generally seen as polite. But she's now annoyed because she felt pressured. The problem here is whether she's wrong to be annoyed. If she's in a position where she needs the seat for her own comfort (due to pregnancy), maybe she's not wrong to keep it. However, maybe she didn't make her condition known, so others couldn't have known. \n\nOn the other hand, the elderly woman might have thought the other woman (who was older but not elderly) needed the seat more. The woman who took the seat didn't seem to show any discomfort, so maybe she didn't need the seat. The original sitter gave up the seat, but maybe she was wrong to feel shamed into it.\n\nSo, considering all this, the woman might not be in the wrong. She's pregnant, which is a valid reason to need a seat. The elderly woman might have overstepped by pressuring her. The woman's annoyance is understandable because she felt unfairly treated. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
