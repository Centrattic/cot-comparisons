I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about giving up a seat at a bus stop. The author is a student who commutes a long way, is pregnant, and was sitting in a bus station. An elderly woman told her to give up her seat to another woman, which she did. Now she's wondering if she was wrong to be annoyed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author had a seat, which was taken by others. The elderly woman then asked the author to give up her seat. The author is 5 months pregnant, which might make her more tired and in need of sitting. But when she was sitting, her pregnancy wasn't visible, but when she stood, it was. So the elderly woman might not have known she was pregnant until she stood up.\n\nThe author didn't feel the other woman needed the seat more because she wasn't showing discomfort. The author was annoyed at the elderly woman for shaming her into giving up her seat. The author is self-aware and says she usually offers her seat if someone needs it more. But in this case, she didn't think the other woman needed it, so she's upset about being pressured.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author had a seat, the elderly woman's request, and the author's decision to give it up. The author's rights to the seat: if the seat was first-come, the author had a right to it. But the elderly woman might be trying to help someone else, maybe seeing the standing woman as in need. However, the author was pregnant, which could be a legitimate need for sitting. \n\nBut the problem is that the elderly woman made a judgment without knowing the author's situation. The author might have a right to be upset because she was asked to give up her seat without knowledge of her condition. The author didn't do anything wrong by taking the seat first. The elderly woman's action was possibly inconsiderate. The author's annoyance is about being shamed and not the other woman taking the seat. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B. The author had a valid reason to sit, the elderly woman's intervention was misplaced, and the author handled it without confrontation. The author is justified in being annoyed at the situation.\n"
