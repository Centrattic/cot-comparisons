I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about giving up a seat at a bus station.\n\nFirst, the background: the author is a student commuting a long distance, 2 hours by bus, and she's 5 months pregnant. She's exhausted after a long day. She takes a seat at the bus station, which is free initially. Then others, including an elderly woman, sit down. Later, another woman stands nearby, not showing discomfort. The elderly woman tells the author to give her seat to the standing woman. The author complies, but feels annoyed because she was embarrassed and her pregnancy wasn't obvious until she stood up.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author was sitting in a free seat. The elderly woman is pressuring her to give up the seat. The author is pregnant but it's not visible when sitting. When she stood, maybe others could see the pregnancy. She gives up the seat out of embarrassment, not because the other woman needed it more. She's questioning if she was in the wrong for being annoyed at the elderly woman's pushiness.\n\nLegally or ethically, is the author wrong? Well, there's no law forcing someone to give up a seat unless it's a specific public transport policy. In many places, there are \"priority seating\" areas for elderly, disabled, or pregnant people. But in this case, the bus station's seats aren't marked as priority. The author was sitting first, then others took seats. The elderly woman might have assumed the author wasn't in need, but since the author is pregnant, maybe the elderly woman thought the other woman needed it more. However, the standing woman didn't show discomfort.\n\nThe author's main issue is feeling shamed into giving up the seat. She's not mad at the woman who took the seat but at the one who made her feel bad. Since the author wasn't forced, but chose to give up the seat, maybe she's not in the wrong. She was in a vulnerable state, pregnant and tired. The elderly woman's action could be seen as overstepping, assuming the author wasn't in need. The author's annoyance is justified because she felt shamed. Also, her pregnancy wasn't visible until standing, so maybe the elderly woman didn't realize the author's condition. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B. The author isn't in the wrong. She was in a situation where she felt pressured, and her reaction is understandable. The elderly woman's behavior was inappropriate, and the author's annoyance is valid.\n"
