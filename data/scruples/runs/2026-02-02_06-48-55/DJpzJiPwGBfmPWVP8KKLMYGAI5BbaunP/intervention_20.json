I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a pregnant woman giving up her seat at a bus station after being asked by an elderly woman, who was prompted by another woman who wasn't visibly in need.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is pregnant, which is a valid reason for needing a seat, especially since standing can be uncomfortable or even risky. However, she mentions that her pregnancy wasn't visible when sitting, which might have led others not to recognize her need. The elderly woman next to her asked her to give up the seat, and she did, even though she was exhausted and pregnant.\n\nThe key points here are: the author was pregnant, but not obviously so when seated. The elderly woman was already seated, and the other woman (who wasn't elderly) was standing. The elderly woman directed the author to give up her seat, possibly under the assumption that the standing woman needed it more. However, the author might have felt that her own need (being pregnant and tired) was being overlooked.\n\nNow, societal norms often prioritize seats for pregnant women, the elderly, disabled, or those with obvious signs of needing a seat. Since the author's condition wasn't visible until she stood up, others might not have known she was pregnant. But once she got up, others would notice. However, the elderly woman's action here might have been based on a misunderstanding. The author, while upset, didn't confront the situation and gave up the seat, which she later feels was wrong because she was in a vulnerable state.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, she wasn't obligated to give up her seat. She did it out of politeness, but felt shamed into it. Others might argue that the elderly woman was trying to help a fellow passenger, thinking the standing woman needed the seat. However, the author's own needs (pregnancy, exhaustion) could be seen as more pressing. \n\nSo, the author's annoyance is understandable. She might feel that she was being asked to give up her seat based on an incorrect assumption. However, since she chose to give it up without confrontation, she might not be in the wrong. On the other hand, maybe the elderly woman's action was inconsiderate, but the author isn't the one who's wrong here. The real question is whether the author was wrong for feeling annoyed. Since she acted politely and gave up the seat, she's not in the wrong. The issue is more about the other woman's assumption and the elderly woman's intervention.\n"
