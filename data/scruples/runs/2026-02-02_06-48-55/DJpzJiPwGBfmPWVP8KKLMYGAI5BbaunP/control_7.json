I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed after giving up their seat at the bus stop. The situation involves the author being pregnant, very tired from a long commute, sitting down when others arrive, and then an elderly woman tells the author to give the seat to another woman. The author did give up the seat, but is annoyed at the woman who told them to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the circumstances. The author is 5 months pregnant, which might not be visibly obvious when sitting. They have a long, tiring commute. Public seating is limited, and the author took a seat when they were available. Then, as others come in, the seats fill up. The elderly woman next to the author then tells the author to give their seat to another woman who's standing. The author feels shamed into giving it up, but they do so, and now they're upset about it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed. Let's break down the key points. The author was sitting when the seat was available. The elderly woman, perhaps thinking the author wasn't in as much need, told them to give up the seat. The other woman wasn't showing signs of discomfort, so it's unclear if she actually needed the seat more. The author's pregnancy might have been a factor, but since it's not visible when sitting, maybe others didn't realize the author's situation. However, the author is clearly exhausted from their commute.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often offer seats to those they perceive as more in need, like the elderly, pregnant, or disabled. The elderly woman might have thought the standing woman was in more need. But the author, being pregnant and tired, could also be considered in need. The author did give up the seat, so they weren't in a confrontation. They're just annoyed at the situation and the pressure from the elderly woman.\n\nThe author's annoyance seems reasonable given their circumstances. They had a right to the seat they took first. The elderly woman's action might have been well-intentioned but could have been a bit abrupt or shaming. The author handled it calmly, which shows they're not in the wrong. They also mention they usually offer seats to those in need, so their actions align with being considerate. The main issue here is the elderly woman's approach. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being annoyed. The answer should be B.\n"
