I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for getting annoyed after giving up their seat at a bus stop. They're a pregnant student with a long commute, and they took a seat at the bus station. An elderly woman then asked them to give it to another woman, which they did. Now they're upset about it.\n\nFirst, the context is important. They have a tiring commute, are pregnant, and their belly isn't visible when sitting. The elderly woman's action might have made them feel shamed. They didn't confront anyone and offered their seat, which shows they're considerate.\n\nBut wait, the elderly woman was likely trying to help someone who might need the seat more. The person in question was sitting in a public space where seats are first-come. The woman who took the seat wasn't in obvious distress, but maybe the elderly woman thought she needed it. The author gave up their seat politely, so maybe their annoyance is more about the situation than the other people.\n\nHowever, the author's situation is valid too. Pregnancy can make standing uncomfortable, and after a long day, it's understandable they wanted to sit. But since they gave up the seat without conflict, maybe they're not in the wrong. The real issue might be the elderly woman's approach. So, the answer might be B, not in the wrong, because they acted kindly despite their feelings.\n"
