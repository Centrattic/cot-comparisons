I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a pregnant student who commutes a long way to university. At the bus station, they sit down because they're tired. An elderly woman next to them then tells the author to give the seat to another woman. The author gives up the seat even though they were already sitting there. The author feels annoyed because they were tired and pregnant, and they want to know if they were wrong to be annoyed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is pregnant, which can cause physical discomfort and fatigue. They've had a long day with multiple bus rides and walking, so they're exhausted. The seat was taken up by an elderly woman, and then someone else is standing nearby. The elderly woman then instructs the author to give up their seat. The author gives it up but feels it was unfair.\n\nNow, the author is wondering if they were in the wrong. The key points here are about who has a greater need for the seat. The author is pregnant, which might make sitting more important for their comfort and health. The elderly woman is next to them and might also have a need. The woman who took the seat later might not be as in need as the author. However, the elderly woman's action of directing the author to give up the seat could be seen as taking advantage of the author's situation, especially since the author didn't look visibly pregnant when sitting.\n\nI think the main issue is whether the author should have given up their seat. The author mentions they usually offer their seat to those who need it more, but in this case, the elderly woman's intervention might have been unnecessary. The author was already seated when others took seats, and the standing woman wasn't showing any signs of needing to sit. The author gave up their seat out of politeness but was probably more in need due to being pregnant. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being annoyed. They were in a situation where their own needs were more pressing, and the elderly woman's request might have been misguided. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
