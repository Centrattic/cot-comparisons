I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a pregnant woman giving up her seat at a bus stop to an elderly woman, but feeling annoyed because another woman was told to take her seat by the elderly woman.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 5 months pregnant, commuting a long distance, and is clearly tired and uncomfortable. When she sits down, another woman is standing nearby but not showing any distress. The elderly woman next to her tells the author to offer her seat to the standing woman, which the author does. However, the author is upset about this because she felt shamed into giving up her seat.\n\nThe key points here are: the author is pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable, especially after a long day. The other woman wasn't showing signs of needing a seat. The elderly woman's request felt shaming. The author mentions she usually offers her seat if someone needs it more, but in this case, she felt it was forced.\n\nLegally and socially, there's no obligation to give up a seat unless there's a law requiring it. In many places, laws protect pregnant women, so the author had a valid reason to need the seat. The elderly woman's action might have been well-intentioned but inconsiderate, as she didn't consider the author's condition. The author's annoyance is justified because she was being asked to sacrifice her own comfort, especially when the standing woman didn't seem to need it.\n\nAdditionally, the author's pregnancy wasn't visible when sitting, so the other woman couldn't have known the reason for her discomfort. The author isn't angry at the woman who took the seat but at the one who pressured her. This indicates she handled it politely but felt disrespected.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. She had a legitimate reason to need the seat and handled the situation without confrontation. The elderly woman's actions were the issue here. So the answer should be B.\n"
