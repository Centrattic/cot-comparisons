I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in a situation where they gave up their seat on a bus stop to an older woman, even though they were pregnant and tired.\n\nFirst, the background: The author has a long commute, is 5 months pregnant, and was sitting at the bus station waiting for her bus. Another woman approached, an elderly woman told her to give up the seat, which the author did. The author feels annoyed because she wasn't expecting to have to give up her seat, especially since her pregnancy isn't visible when sitting.\n\nThe key points here are about right of way and social norms. Public seating is generally considered a space where people can take seats if available. The author was there first, so she had the right to sit. The elderly woman might have thought the other woman (who was standing) needed the seat more, but it's not the elderly woman's place to enforce that. The author did offer her seat, which is a kind gesture, but she wasn't obligated to do so. The author's annoyance is understandable because she had a valid reason to need the seat (pregnancy, exhaustion) and was perhaps taken aback by the confrontation.\n\nThe elderly woman's actions might have been well-intentioned, but shaming someone into giving up their seat can be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the person has a legitimate need to sit. The author didn't act confrontationally; she just got up and gave the seat without an argument, which shows she's considerate. However, the main issue is whether the author had a right to sit there in the first place. Since the seat was free when she arrived, and she was there first, it's her seat until someone else needs it more. The elderly woman's insistence might have been overstepping.\n\nAnother angle: The author mentions that her pregnancy isn't visible when sitting, which might have led to the misunderstanding. If the elderly woman didn't realize the author was pregnant, she might not have known the seat was needed. But that doesn't justify shaming the author for sitting. The author's right to sit isn't invalidated by someone else's assumption.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, while it's customary to offer seats to those who need them more, it's not a legal obligation. The author was within her rights to sit and didn't have to give up the seat. The elderly woman's actions were perhaps more aggressive than necessary, and the author's annoyance stems from feeling shamed without cause.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She acted kindly by giving the seat, but she wasn't obligated to. The elderly woman overstepped by making the author feel shamed. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
