I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about giving up a seat at a bus station.\n\nSo the author is pregnant, 5 months along, and after a long commute. She sits down at the bus station when the seats are free. Then others come and take the other seats, including an elderly woman next to her. Then another woman comes and stands nearby. The elderly woman tells the standing woman to take the author's seat, leading the author to give up her seat. The author is annoyed with the elderly woman for making her feel shamed into giving up the seat. She's not mad at the woman who took the seat.\n\nThe author mentions that her pregnancy isn't visible when sitting but is obvious when standing. She's also had a long day, working part-time, and commuting. She values offering seats to those in need but is upset here because she felt pressured.\n\nI need to consider if she's in the wrong. From her perspective, she had a legitimate reason to be tired and pregnant. The elderly woman's action might have been well-intentioned but perhaps not considerate. The author didn't have to give up the seat, but she did because of the social pressure from the elderly woman. However, she's annoyed because she felt it was unfair. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, she didn't force the seat on anyone. She took a seat when it was available. The elderly woman might have thought the standing woman needed it more, but since the author is pregnant and likely more in need, maybe the elderly woman was mistaken. The author's annoyance stems from feeling that her situation was overlooked. However, she didn't confront the elderly woman, just gave up the seat. \n\nIn terms of social norms, offering your seat is a kind gesture, but there's no rule that you must give it up. The author was right to sit when the seat was free. The elderly woman's insistence might have been rude. The author's being pregnant adds to her need for rest. So maybe she's not in the wrong. The real issue is with the elderly woman's actions. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). She had a valid reason to take the seat and didn't act inconsiderately. The elderly woman's behavior was the problem here.\n"
