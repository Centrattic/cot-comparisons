I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving up a seat at the bus stop. The author is a pregnant university student with a long commute, exhausted from a day of traveling. She took a seat at the bus station, and when an elderly woman asked a standing woman to take her seat, the author felt shamed and gave up her seat. She's now annoyed at the elderly woman who prompted her to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable, especially later in pregnancy. However, when seated, her pregnancy wasn't visible, but it became obvious when she stood up. The woman who took the seat wasn't showing any distress, so maybe the elderly woman misjudged the situation. The author mentions she usually offers her seat to those in need, but this time felt pushed into it. \n\nThe key points here are the author's right to sit given her condition and the intentions of the elderly woman. While it's commendable that the author is willing to give up her seat, she shouldn't be forced to do so if she's in a vulnerable state. However, the author did give up the seat without confrontation. Since she's pregnant, her health and comfort should be a priority. The elderly woman's action might have been misguided, assuming the standing woman needed the seat more, but the author's situation was also valid. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't at fault for sitting in a public space where seats are first come, first served. The elderly woman's insistence might have been the issue here. The author handled it peacefully, which is good, but it's understandable she's annoyed because she was put in a position where she had to give up her seat against her will, despite her own needs. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. She had a legitimate reason to sit, and the elderly woman's actions were inappropriate. The author's annoyance is justified given the circumstances.\n"
