I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong when they gave up their seat at the bus station after being approached by an elderly woman.\n\nFirst, the author is pregnant, five months along, which might not be immediately obvious when sitting but is more noticeable when standing. They had a long commute, ending up at the central bus station where they found one of the few available seats. Soon after, other people took the remaining seats, and an elderly woman sat next to them. Then, another woman, not elderly, was standing nearby. The elderly woman called over to the other woman, indicating she should take the author's seat, leading the author to stand up and give their seat, even though they were pregnant and tired.\n\nThe author is questioning if they were right to be annoyed at the elderly woman who shamed them into giving up the seat. They mention that they usually offer their seat if someone needs it more, but here they felt pressured by the elderly woman's actions.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's right to the seat they occupied first, their own needs (pregnancy, exhaustion), the elderly woman's assertion of authority, and the dynamics of public seating etiquette.\n\nPublic seating etiquette often suggests that if someone is already seated, it's up to them to decide whether to offer their seat. The elderly woman's action of directing the other woman to take the author's seat could be seen as overstepping, especially if the author was in a more vulnerable state (pregnant and tired). The author didn't force the elderly woman to take the seat, but the elderly woman's insistence might have made the author feel uncomfortable, leading them to give up the seat despite their own needs.\n\nThe author's annoyance is likely because they felt their right to rest was infringed upon. They might feel that the elderly woman was assuming they were less in need, not considering the author's condition. However, the author did choose to give up the seat, which could be seen as courteous, but the question is about whether they were wrong to be annoyed.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's often an unspoken rule that pregnant individuals should be offered seats, but if someone is already seated, they aren't obligated to give it up unless someone clearly needs it more. The elderly woman's approach might have been rude or inconsiderate, especially since the author's pregnancy wasn't obvious until they stood up. The elderly woman might not have known about the author's condition, leading to a misunderstanding.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling annoyed. They had a valid reason to be tired and pregnant, and the elderly woman's actions could be seen as intrusive. The author's choice to give up the seat was kind, but the pressure from the elderly woman was inappropriate. Therefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
