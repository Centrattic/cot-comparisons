I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving up a seat at a bus stop. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author is a pregnant student with a long commute, which is tiring. She takes a seat at the bus station because she's exhausted. An elderly woman next to her then tells her to give the seat to another woman who's also there. The author complies, but later feels annoyed at the elderly woman for making her feel shamed into giving up her seat.\n\nFirst, the author's situation: pregnant, long commute, physically tired. Pregnancy can make standing uncomfortable, and her belly is visible when standing. She mentions that she usually offers seats to those in need but doesn't expect others to give up seats for her. The key point here is that she wasn't in a position where she could comfortably stand for a long time, especially being 5 months pregnant.\n\nThe elderly woman's action: she told the author to give up her seat to another woman. The other woman wasn't showing any signs of needing a seat, just standing normally. The question is whether the elderly woman had the right to pressure the author to give up her seat. \n\nLegally and ethically, in many places, pregnant women are entitled to sit, especially if they're visibly pregnant. But the author's belly wasn't visible when sitting. However, once she stood up, it became obvious. The elderly woman might have thought the other woman needed the seat more, but there's no indication the other woman was in need. \n\nThe author's annoyance is directed at the elderly woman for making her feel shamed. The author didn't fight back, which she admits, but she's wondering if she was right to feel upset. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She gave up her seat politely, but the elderly woman's action might have been inappropriate. The author was in a valid position to keep her seat, especially considering her pregnancy and the physical toll of her commute. The elderly woman might not have realized the author's condition when she sat down. \n\nIn such situations, it's generally acceptable to keep a seat if you need it for your own comfort, especially if you're visibly pregnant. The elderly woman's assumption that the other woman needed it more might be incorrect. The author didn't do anything wrong by keeping her seat and then gave it up upon being asked, but she's justified in feeling annoyed because the elderly woman didn't consider her situation.\n"
