I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a pregnant woman who took a seat at a bus station and was told by an elderly woman to give it up for another woman. The key points here are her pregnancy, her long commute, and the fact that she gave up the seat without much confrontation.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the context. She's pregnant, which is a valid reason to need a seat. However, when she sat down, all seats were free. Then others took the remaining seats, including an elderly person. The elderly woman then told her to give her seat to another woman. The author stood up and gave the seat, but later felt annoyed at the elderly woman for shaming her.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. She didn't do anything illegal or unethical by taking a seat when they were available. She was pregnant, which is a common reason for needing a seat. The elderly woman's action of shaming her into giving up the seat might be considered rude. The author didn't have to give up the seat, but she did out of politeness. She's not angry at the woman who took the seat, but at the one who made her give it up.\n\nThe author mentions she always offers her seat to those in need, which shows she's considerate. However, in this case, she felt pressured. The elderly woman's behavior was inappropriate. The author's annoyance is directed at the wrong person, not the one who took the seat. She's not in the wrong for taking the seat initially or for giving it up. The real issue is the elderly woman's shaming. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
