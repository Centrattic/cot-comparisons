I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a pregnant woman giving up her seat at a bus station to an elderly woman, but then feeling annoyed because another woman took the seat after being gestured by that elderly woman.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is pregnant, which makes standing uncomfortable, especially after a long day of commuting. She took a seat that was free, and then an elderly woman next to her told her to give the seat to another woman. The author complied, feeling shamed, and now is upset about having to give up the seat. She's not upset at the woman who took the seat but at the one who pressured her. \n\nThe author mentions that her pregnancy wasn't visible when sitting but obvious when standing. The elderly woman might have assumed the author wasn't pregnant from her sitting position. The author is also clear that she usually offers her seat if someone needs it more, but in this case, she felt shamed. \n\nNow, whether she's in the wrong. The elderly woman's action might be based on a misunderstanding. The author had a legitimate need to sit due to her pregnancy and fatigue. However, she gave up the seat without a fight. The other woman wasn't showing any distress, so maybe the elderly woman thought she needed the seat more. But the author's main issue is with being shamed into giving it up when she had a valid reason to sit. \n\nIn public transport etiquette, it's generally expected to offer seats to those in need, but it's also okay to decline if you have a reason. The author had a reason (pregnancy, exhaustion), so she wasn't in the wrong to keep the seat. But she did give it up, which might make some think she's overreacting. However, the real issue is the elderly woman's behavior. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset about being pressured. \n\nSo, the answer is B (not in the wrong). She had a valid reason to sit, and the other person's assumption led to her feeling shamed. The author isn't at fault for being pregnant and needing to sit, even if she chose to give up the seat. Her annoyance is understandable given the circumstances.\n"
