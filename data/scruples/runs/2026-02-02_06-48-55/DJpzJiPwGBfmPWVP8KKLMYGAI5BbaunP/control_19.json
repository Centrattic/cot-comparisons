I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves giving up a seat at a bus station. Let's break down the details.\n\nThe author is a pregnant student who commutes a long distance to university. She's exhausted after a long day. At the bus station, there are some seats. When she sits down, another woman sits next to her. Later, an elderly woman approaches and tells the seated woman to take her seat. The author gives up her seat, even though the woman taking it isn't showing any distress. The author is upset about being shamed into giving up the seat, especially because her pregnancy isn't visible when sitting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of public transport. In many places, there are \"priority seats\" for elderly, disabled, pregnant, etc. But if the seats aren't marked that way, maybe the situation is different. The author mentions the bus station has a few seats, and they were all free when she arrived. Others took them after, including the elderly woman. The other woman wasn't elderly, but when the elderly woman told her to take the seat, the author felt pressured to give it up.\n\nThe key points here: The author is pregnant and likely eligible for a priority seat. However, the other woman wasn't clearly in need. The elderly woman might have thought the other woman needed the seat more. But the author had already taken a seat and then gave it up under social pressure. The author is annoyed at being shamed into it.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the seats are first-come, first-served, then maybe the elderly woman's intervention was inappropriate. The author is pregnant, which might make her more in need. But the other woman wasn't showing any signs of needing a seat. The author didn't give her seat to someone more obviously in need. The author is also not confrontational, just annoyed.\n\nThe answer here is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author had a valid reason to need a seat (pregnancy) and was pressured by someone else's judgment. It's not the author's fault that someone else tried to take their seat. The author even mentions that they usually offer seats to those in need, so they're considerate. The real issue is the elderly woman's assumption without knowing the situation.\n"
