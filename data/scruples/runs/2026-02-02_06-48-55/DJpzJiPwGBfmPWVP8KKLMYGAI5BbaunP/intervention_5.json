I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is pregnant, which is a valid reason for needing a seat, especially after a long commute. They had taken an empty seat in the bus station. Then an elderly woman next to them told a standing woman to sit there instead. The author gave up their seat, but now they're annoyed at the elderly woman for making them do that.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are:\n\n1. **Rights to the seat**: The author was sitting in an empty seat first. If others are standing, the author has a claim to that seat. But maybe the elderly woman's comment was just trying to help someone in need. However, the standing woman wasn't showing any signs of needing the seat, like being disabled or elderly. The elderly woman might have assumed she needed it more, but that's not clear.\n\n2. **Pregnancy consideration**: The author is 5 months pregnant, which can make sitting more important. But the visibility of the pregnancy was only when standing, so maybe the elderly woman didn't notice it immediately. The author might have expected others to offer a seat if they saw the pregnancy, but the author was sitting. Maybe the standing woman wasn't aware, but the elderly woman could have checked.\n\n3. **Social norms**: In many places, people are encouraged to offer seats to those who need it more. But if the author was already seated, perhaps they have a right to stay. However, the elderly woman might have thought the standing woman needed it more. But the author's situation (pregnant, tired from a long day) could be seen as a valid reason to keep the seat.\n\n4. **Author's reaction**: The author gave up the seat without confrontation, which is understandable. But their annoyance is directed at the elderly woman for making them feel shamed. The author might feel that their need was overlooked. However, the elderly woman might have thought she was helping appropriately.\n\n5. **Hormones and stress**: The author mentions being hormonal, which could affect their reaction. But that doesn't necessarily make them wrong. They also state they usually offer seats to others, which shows they're considerate.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They gave up their seat, which is polite, but maybe the elderly woman overstepped. The author might be justified in feeling annoyed because their own need (pregnancy, exhaustion) wasn't acknowledged. However, the author could have calmly explained their situation before moving. But the elderly woman's action might have been based on a misunderstanding. \n\nAlternatively, the author might be in the right because they had a valid reason to keep the seat. The elderly woman's comment was possibly inconsiderate. The author's annoyance is understandable. So, considering all factors, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They had a legitimate reason to sit, and the elderly woman's action was rude or misguided. The author's decision to give up the seat without a fight shows they're kind, but their annoyance is justified because their needs were overlooked. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
