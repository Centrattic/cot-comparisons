I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a pregnant woman who gave up her seat at a bus station to an elderly woman after being shamed by another woman. The author is questioning if they were wrong to be annoyed about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is pregnant, which can cause physical discomfort and fatigue. She's also commuting a long distance, which is tiring. She took a seat at the bus station, and when someone else tried to get her to give it up, she felt shamed into it. The main issue is whether giving up the seat was necessary or if she was in the wrong for being annoyed.\n\nThe key points here are: her pregnancy (which might make sitting important for her health and comfort), the fact that she was already seated and the others came later, and the other woman's insistence. In many places, there are policies or social norms about giving up seats for pregnant women, elderly, or those with disabilities. However, in this case, the author didn't visibly show her pregnancy until standing up, so maybe others weren't aware initially.\n\nThe other woman, who wasn't elderly, was standing and not showing discomfort. The elderly woman sitting next to the author then directed her to take the seat. The author, feeling embarrassed, gave up the seat. But since the seat was taken first by the author, maybe the other woman's action was inconsiderate. The author isn't upset at the woman who took the seat, but at the one who pressured her.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for needing to sit and for being annoyed at being pressured. Her health and comfort are important, especially being pregnant. The other woman's actions might have been inappropriate, assuming the author wasn't visibly pregnant. So, the answer would be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
