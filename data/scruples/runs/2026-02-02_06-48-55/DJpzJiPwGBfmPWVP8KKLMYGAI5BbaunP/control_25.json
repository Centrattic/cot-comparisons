I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about giving up a seat at a bus stop.\n\nSo the background is that the author is a pregnant student with a long commute. She's exhausted after a long day. She takes a seat at the bus station, then an elderly woman tells her to give it to another woman. The author complies but is annoyed because she feels shamed. The key points are her pregnancy (which isn't visible when sitting), her physical exhaustion from a long commute, and the sudden request from the elderly woman.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author was in the wrong. The elderly woman asked her to give up the seat. The author was already sitting, and the other woman wasn't showing signs of needing a seat. The author mentions that she's pregnant and tired, which might make her need the seat more. However, the elderly woman might have thought the other woman needed it more. But the author wasn't in any visible distress when sitting, except when standing. \n\nThe author says she's not annoyed at the woman who took the seat, but at the elderly woman who made her give it up. The question is whether the author was wrong to feel annoyed. \n\nIn many places, there are laws about giving up seats for the elderly, but that's more for public transport. In a bus station waiting area, it's more about etiquette. The author was there first, and the seats were limited. The elderly woman might have thought she was helping, but maybe overstepped. The author's situation (pregnant, tired) could be a valid reason to keep the seat. \n\nAlso, the author mentions she usually offers her seat if someone needs it more. But in this case, the other woman wasn't showing any signs of needing it. The elderly woman's action might have been based on incorrect assumptions. \n\nSo, the author's annoyance is understandable. She was in a vulnerable state (pregnant, tired) and was shamed into giving up a seat she had first. The elderly woman's action was possibly rude or judgmental. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
