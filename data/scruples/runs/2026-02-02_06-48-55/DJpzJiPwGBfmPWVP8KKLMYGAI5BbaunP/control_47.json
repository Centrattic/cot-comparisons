I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a pregnant woman giving up her seat at a bus station because an elderly woman shamed her into it. \n\nFirst, the author was sitting in an available seat at the bus station. She's 5 months pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable, especially after a long commute. The elderly woman told her she should give the seat to another woman. The author felt embarrassed and gave up her seat. She's now wondering if she was wrong to be annoyed at the elderly woman.\n\nPublic transportation etiquette often involves offering seats to those who need them more. However, in this case, the bus station isn't a moving vehicle, so the rules might be different. Seats at stations are for waiting passengers. The author had a legitimate need due to pregnancy and fatigue, especially since she's commuting a long distance. The elderly woman's insistence might have been inappropriate, as the author had already chosen a seat first. \n\nThe key points are: the author's medical condition (pregnancy) which makes standing harder, the fact that she was at a bus station (not on a bus where seat availability can change quickly), and the elderly woman's shaming behavior. The author didn't do anything wrong by taking a seat she was entitled to. The woman who took the seat might not have needed it as much, and the elderly woman's actions were more about social pressure than actual need. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She had a valid reason to sit, and the other woman's actions were overstepping. The answer should be B.\n"
