I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they were sitting at a bus stop, and after sitting down, an elderly woman told a standing woman to take their seat. The author gave up their seat to the standing woman, who then took it. The author is annoyed at the elderly woman for making them feel shamed into giving up the seat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a student who commutes a long distance by bus, works part-time, and is 5 months pregnant. They were exhausted after a long day. The seat was initially free, and they took it. Then all other seats filled up, with an elderly woman sitting next to them. A standing woman was there, not showing discomfort. The elderly woman directed her to the author's seat, which led the author to give up their seat.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is pregnant, which might make standing more uncomfortable, especially as the pregnancy progresses. However, the author mentions that the pregnancy wasn't visible when sitting but was obvious when standing. So maybe the elderly woman didn't realize the author was pregnant until they stood up? \n\nThe author is asking if they were wrong to be annoyed. They do mention that they don't like confrontation and just let it go. They also say they usually offer seats to those in need, but in this case, they felt shamed into giving it up.\n\nFrom a social etiquette perspective, it's common to offer a seat to someone who might need it more, like the elderly, pregnant, or disabled. However, the elderly woman in this case might have misjudged the situation. The standing woman wasn't showing signs of needing the seat, so maybe the elderly woman assumed the author wasn't in need (since they were sitting) and the standing woman was. But the author was sitting, which might indicate they were tired, pregnant, etc. \n\nThe author's pregnancy is a valid reason to need a seat. If the elderly woman didn't know about the pregnancy, she might have thought the author was just sitting and the standing woman needed it more. But the author felt shamed, which is a valid emotion. However, the author did offer the seat, so maybe they felt they had to, but the real issue is the way the elderly woman approached them.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? I don't think so. They had a legitimate reason to need a seat (pregnancy, exhaustion), and the elderly woman's intervention might have been abrupt or unnecessary. The author isn't upset with the woman who took the seat, but with the woman who made them feel shamed. The author handled it calmly by giving up the seat but is rightfully annoyed at the shaming aspect. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
