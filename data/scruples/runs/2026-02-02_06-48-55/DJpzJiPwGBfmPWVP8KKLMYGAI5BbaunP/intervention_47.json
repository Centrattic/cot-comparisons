I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about giving up a seat at a bus stop.\n\nSo the background: The author is a pregnant student with a long commute. After a tiring day, they sit down at the bus station. An elderly woman next to her then tells a standing woman to take her seat. The author gives up the seat out of embarrassment, even though she's pregnant, which wasn't visible when sitting. The author is annoyed at the elderly woman for making her feel shamed into giving up the seat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable, especially later in pregnancy. She's also had a long day with multiple bus rides and a big campus. Her feet hurt, so sitting would be beneficial. The elderly woman might have thought the standing woman needed the seat more, but she didn't check if the seated person had a valid reason to stay.\n\nIn many public transport settings, there are policies about giving up seats for pregnant individuals. So maybe the elderly woman was unaware of that. The author, however, didn't explicitly state her condition until she stood up. The elderly woman might not have known she was pregnant. \n\nThe author's reaction: she's annoyed at being made to feel she had to give up the seat. But she did offer the seat to others when appropriate. She doesn't blame the woman who took the seat, just the one who pressured her. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she gave up the seat, but maybe she could have explained her situation. However, she was in a public place, and her pregnancy wasn't obvious until she stood. She might not have felt comfortable asserting herself, especially with an elderly person. The elderly woman's action might have been well-intentioned but misplaced. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She had a valid reason to need the seat, and the elderly woman didn't have all the information. The author's annoyance is justified because she was put in an awkward position. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
