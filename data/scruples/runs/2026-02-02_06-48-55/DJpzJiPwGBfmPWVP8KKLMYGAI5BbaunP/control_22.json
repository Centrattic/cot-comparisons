I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about giving up a seat at a bus station. The author is a pregnant student who's had a long day commuting, and she gave up her seat to a woman after an elderly woman asked her to. She's annoyed at being shamed into doing so because her pregnancy wasn't obvious until she stood up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's pregnant, which can affect her comfort and mobility. She's been on her feet a lot after a long commute. When she sat down, the seat was free. Then an elderly woman sat next to her. Later, another woman approached, and the elderly woman told the author to give up her seat. The author did so, but felt wronged because her pregnancy wasn't visible when she was sitting.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the elderly woman might have thought the other woman needed the seat more. But the author was pregnant, which is a valid reason to prefer sitting. However, she gave up the seat without being asked directly. The key point is whether the author was in the wrong for giving up the seat when she could have refused. The elderly woman's request might have been based on a misunderstanding. The author mentions she's usually willing to offer seats to those in need, which is considerate. She's not upset with the woman who took the seat but with the shaming from the elderly woman. \n\nIn public transportation etiquette, people often give up seats to those who need them more, but it's also okay to decline if you have a valid reason. The author had a legitimate reason (pregnancy) to want to sit, but she gave in to pressure. However, since she's not in pain from the other woman and her pregnancy wasn't obvious until she stood, maybe the elderly woman didn't know. So, the author isn't in the wrong for giving up the seat because she didn't have to. She's justified in feeling annoyed at being shamed for not staying seated when her condition wasn't visible. So the answer is B.\n"
