I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the person is a pregnant student with a long commute. They took a seat at the bus station, and after a while, another woman stood nearby. An elderly woman next to the author told the standing woman to sit in the author's seat. The author, feeling embarrassed, gave up their seat. Now they're wondering if they were in the wrong for being annoyed at the elderly woman.\n\nFirst, the author is pregnant, which is a valid reason to need a seat, especially since they mentioned being exhausted from a long commute. The elderly woman who asked them to give up the seat might have thought the standing woman needed it more. But the author was already seated first, and the standing woman wasn't showing any distress.\n\nThe author didn't force the elderly woman to do anything; they just got up and let the woman sit. The main issue here is whether the author was wrong for giving up the seat when it wasn't necessary. The author mentions they usually offer seats to those in need, but in this case, the standing woman didn't seem to need it. The elderly woman's insistence might have made the author feel shamed, which is understandable. \n\nSince the author wasn't aggressive and just chose to be polite, even if they felt wronged, it's hard to say they're in the wrong. The real problem might be the elderly woman's actions, but the question is about the author. The author's annoyance is understandable given their situation. So, I think the answer is B\u2014they aren't in the wrong.\n"
