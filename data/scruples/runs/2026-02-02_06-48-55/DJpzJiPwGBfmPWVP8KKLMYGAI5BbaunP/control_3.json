I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant woman who gave up her seat at a bus station to an elderly woman after being asked by another woman who wasn't elderly. The key points here are the context of her pregnancy, her long commute, and the social dynamics involved.\n\nFirst, the author is 5 months pregnant. While her belly isn't visible when sitting, it becomes obvious when standing. She mentions that people often assume she's having twins because of the size, but she's just having one big baby. So, pregnancy-related discomfort is a factor here. She's exhausted from a long commute, which includes multiple buses and a walk, especially after a day at university and work on weekends. She's not in the wrong for needing a seat after such a journey.\n\nThe elderly woman who sat next to her probably has a legitimate need for the seat, given her age. However, the situation arises when another woman, not elderly, is standing nearby. The elderly woman then tells the author to give up her seat to this other woman. The author complies but feels shamed and is now wondering if she was wrong to be annoyed.\n\nThe main question is about whether the author is at fault. From a social etiquette standpoint, it's common to offer seats to those who need them more. However, the author was already sitting, and the elderly woman's intervention might have been premature. The elderly woman might have misinterpreted the situation, not realizing the author's own need due to pregnancy. The author's decision to give up the seat was kind, but the elderly woman's approach could have been tactful. \n\nThe author's annoyance is understandable because she was made to feel like she had to give up her seat despite her own circumstances. Her hormone levels and stress from the long day might have contributed to her feelings. She also clarified that she wouldn't expect someone to give up their seat for her if they were there first, which shows she's considerate. The woman who took the seat didn't seem to need it, as she wasn't showing discomfort. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's about mutual respect and understanding. The elderly woman's actions might have been based on a lack of awareness of the author's situation. The author isn't in the wrong for being annoyed because she was put in a position where she felt shamed. It's a complex situation where both parties might have had good intentions but a misunderstanding. The author's response was appropriate, and her feelings of being wronged are valid given the context.\n"
