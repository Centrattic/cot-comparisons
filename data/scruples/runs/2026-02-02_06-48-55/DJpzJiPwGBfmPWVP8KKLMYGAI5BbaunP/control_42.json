I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being annoyed about giving up their seat. The situation involves a pregnant woman at a busy bus station. She took a seat because she's exhausted and 5 months pregnant, which isn't obvious when sitting. An elderly woman then tells her to give the seat to another woman. The author gave up the seat out of embarrassment but is now annoyed.\n\nFirst, the author's main points: She's pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable, especially after a long commute. She's physically tired from a 2-hour bus ride and walking. The elderly woman directed her to give up the seat without considering her needs. The author didn't confront the situation because she avoids conflict. She's questioning if she was right to feel annoyed.\n\nLegally and socially, there's no law forcing someone to give up a seat unless it's a priority seat. In many places, priority seating is for elderly, pregnant, disabled. But if the seat isn't marked, it's a choice. The author was in a public space where seating is first-come, first-served unless someone voluntarily gives it up. The elderly woman's action might be based on her own assumptions, perhaps not seeing the author's pregnancy.\n\nThe author's annoyance stems from feeling shamed. She's in a vulnerable state (pregnant, tired) and might not have looked obviously pregnant while sitting. The other woman didn't seem in distress, so maybe the elderly woman misjudged the situation. The author's choice to give up the seat was kind, but the elderly woman's behavior was inconsiderate. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset; she had valid reasons to want to sit. Her response was non-confrontational, which is understandable. So the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
