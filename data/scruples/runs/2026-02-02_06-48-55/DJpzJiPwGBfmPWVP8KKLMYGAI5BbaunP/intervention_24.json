I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about a pregnant woman who was sitting in a bus station, and an elderly woman told her to give up her seat to another woman who wasn't showing any signs of needing it. The author got up and gave her seat but is now annoyed, feeling shamed. The main question is whether she was wrong to be annoyed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 5 months pregnant, which can cause discomfort, especially after a long day of commuting. She's been traveling for hours, and her legs are hurting. The seats were all free when she first arrived, but then others took the other seats. The elderly woman directed the other woman to take the author's seat. The author says her pregnancy wasn't visible when sitting but obvious when standing.\n\nNow, the key points: Is it right to assume the other woman needed the seat more? The author mentions that the woman who took the seat wasn't showing discomfort and was just minding her own business. The elderly woman's action might have been based on a mistaken assumption, thinking the author was able-bodied, maybe not noticing her pregnancy when she was sitting. But when the author stood up, her pregnancy became obvious. So the elderly woman might have misjudged the situation.\n\nThe author's reaction: She gave up her seat, but she's annoyed at the elderly woman for shaming her. She's not upset at the woman who took the seat. The author also mentions she usually offers her seat if someone needs it more, so she's not being selfish in general.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she gave up the seat when asked, even though she had a legitimate reason to need it. But she's annoyed because she felt shamed. However, the elderly woman might have acted out of a misunderstanding. The author's annoyance is towards the elderly woman's assumption. Since the elderly woman didn't know the author was pregnant when she asked her to give up the seat, it's possible she acted without full knowledge. But the author's situation is valid, especially considering her physical condition.\n\nIn many places, laws or social norms might prioritize pregnant women for seating. If the elderly woman was aware of the situation, she might have been wrong to insist. But since the author's pregnancy wasn't visible when seated, the elderly woman might not have known. The author's annoyance is understandable because she was put in an awkward position. However, the author's action of giving up the seat wasn't wrong per se, as she chose to do so. The real issue is the elderly woman's assumption.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No). She's justified in feeling annoyed because the situation was mishandled by the elderly woman, not by the author. The author acted politely and gave up the seat, so she isn't at fault.\n"
