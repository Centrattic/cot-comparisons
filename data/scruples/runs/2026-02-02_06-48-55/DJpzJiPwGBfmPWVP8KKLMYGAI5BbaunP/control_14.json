I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for getting annoyed after giving up their seat at the bus stop. \n\nFirst, the background details are important. The author is a student commuting a long distance, using public transport, and is 5 months pregnant. She's exhausted from her commute and pregnant, which is a valid reason to need a seat. When she sits down, all the other seats get taken. Then, an elderly woman next to her points her out to another woman, making her feel shamed into giving up her seat. The other woman takes her seat.\n\nSo the main points here: the author was sitting, the seat wasn't occupied by someone more in need (like the elderly or someone with a disability), and the elderly woman's actions made her feel uncomfortable. The author is annoyed with the elderly woman, not the one who took the seat. \n\nNow, considering societal norms, people often offer seats to pregnant women, especially if they're visibly showing. In this case, the author's pregnancy wasn't visible when sitting, only when standing. The elderly woman might not have noticed the pregnancy until after she sat down. But the way she called over the other woman and pointedly told her to sit where the author was seems impolite. \n\nThe author isn't refusing to give up the seat if someone actually needs it. She's just annoyed at the way she was shamed into doing it. She values politeness and non-confrontation. Since the other woman wasn't in obvious distress, the author's reaction is understandable. \n\nLegally and ethically, there's no rule that forces someone to give up their seat unless it's a specific policy, which isn't mentioned here. The author's annoyance is more about the social interaction rather than the act of giving up the seat itself. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. She had a right to her seat, and the elderly woman's actions were inappropriate. The author handled it calmly by giving up the seat when asked, which is considerate, but she's justified in feeling annoyed at the shaming.\n"
