I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for getting annoyed about giving up their seat at the bus stop. The situation involves the author, who is a pregnant university student with a long commute, taking a seat at a bus station. An elderly woman then tells her to give the seat to another woman who's standing. The author complies but is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a long, tiring commute and is 5 months pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable. The bus station seats were all free when she first arrived, but others took the other seats, including an elderly woman sitting next to her. Then, another woman stands nearby. The elderly woman points out that the standing woman can take the author's seat. The author gives up the seat, feeling shamed, and is now annoyed at the elderly woman for making her do that.\n\nI should assess the rights and responsibilities here. In many public transportation settings, there are often designated seats for priority passengers like the elderly, disabled, or pregnant. However, in this case, the station isn't a bus itself, so maybe the rules are different. The key point is whether the author had a valid reason to keep the seat. Since she's pregnant, even if it's not visibly obvious when seated, she might have a legitimate need for a seat. The elderly woman might have thought the standing woman needed it more, but the author's condition could also be a valid reason.\n\nNow, the author didn't visibly show her pregnancy when seated, so others might not be aware. The elderly woman's action of shaming her into giving up the seat could be seen as inappropriate if the author had a right to the seat. However, the author did offer her seat to someone else when she thought they needed it more. The conflict arises from the elderly woman's insistence and the author's feeling of being shamed.\n\nThe author's annoyance is directed at the elderly woman, not the one who took the seat. The user says they wouldn't expect someone to give up their seat if they were there first, but in this case, the author was there first. The elderly woman's action might have been a social norm violation if she assumed the author wasn't needing the seat. Also, the author might have a right to keep the seat if they are pregnant, even if not visible when seated.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. She was in a situation where she had a valid reason (pregnancy) to need a seat, and the elderly woman's shaming was the issue. The author's annoyance is justified because she was made to feel guilty for a legitimate need. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
