I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault for getting annoyed when they had to give up their seat at the bus stop. \n\nFirst, the background info: She's a student commuting 2 hours, works part-time on weekends, and is 5 months pregnant. She's exhausted after her long day and takes a seat at the bus station. An elderly woman next to her then tells her to give the seat to another woman who's standing. The key points here are her state of being pregnant (which might affect her comfort), her long and tiring commute, and the fact that the seat was already occupied by others except the elderly woman when she arrived.\n\nThe user is upset not because the woman took the seat, but because the elderly woman made her feel shamed into giving it up. She mentions she's not annoyed at the woman who took the seat but at the one who pressured her. Also, her pregnancy wasn't visible when sitting but obvious when standing. She's always willing to offer her seat to someone in more need, but in this case, she felt she needed it more due to her condition and fatigue.\n\nSo, considering the context: She had a long day, is pregnant, and was sitting in a seat that was available when she arrived. The elderly woman's action might have been well-intentioned but inconsiderate of her situation. The question is whether she's in the wrong for being annoyed. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, there's an expectation to offer seats to those in need, but there's also an understanding that people with specific needs (like being pregnant) might need to sit more. The woman who was told to move might feel she had a valid reason to stay seated. Since the elderly woman initiated the pressure, the fault isn't on the author for getting annoyed. She's not in the wrong for standing up to someone else's request if she feels her own needs are more pressing. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
