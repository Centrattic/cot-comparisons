I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed after giving up their seat at a bus stop. The situation involves the author being pregnant, which isn't visible when sitting, and an elderly woman insisting that a standing woman take their seat. \n\nFirst, the author's background is important. They have a long commute, are pregnant, and are exhausted. The bus station seats were all free when they arrived. The elderly woman then tells the standing woman to take the author's seat. The author gives up the seat but feels wronged by the elderly woman's actions.\n\nI need to consider if the author was in the wrong. The key points are the author's right to sit, the elderly woman's actions, and the standing woman's need. Since the author is pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable, they might have a legitimate need to sit. However, the elderly woman might have thought the standing woman needed it more, perhaps not realizing the author's condition.\n\nBut the issue here is that the author's pregnancy wasn't visible until they stood up. The elderly woman might not have known the author's situation. The author didn't confront them but just gave up the seat. The main annoyance is towards the elderly woman for shaming them into giving up the seat. \n\nLegally or socially, there's no rule that pregnant people have priority over others for seats unless a seat is specifically designated. Since the author wasn't in a seat reserved for pregnant individuals, maybe the elderly woman's action was out of politeness. However, the author felt wronged because their need was legitimate but unseen. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They had a valid reason to sit but the elderly woman didn't know. The author handled it calmly, didn't confront, and the issue is more about the elderly woman's lack of awareness. The author's annoyance is justified because their need was real but unperceived. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
