I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a pregnant woman giving up her seat at a bus stop to an elderly woman who then insists she sits there instead.\n\nFirst, the woman is pregnant and in a lot of discomfort, especially after a long commute. She mentions being 5 months pregnant, which might not be visibly obvious when sitting, but she says people often think she's having twins. That could mean she's experiencing some physical strain that's not immediately visible to others.\n\nThen there's the elderly woman who asks her to move. The author of the post felt shamed into giving up the seat. The key here is whether the elderly woman had the right to ask her to move. The bus station had a few seats, and they were all taken. The elderly woman was already sitting next to her, so maybe she felt she needed the two seats for herself? Or maybe she misjudged the situation.\n\nThe author is annoyed because she felt shamed, not at the woman who took the seat. She also mentions that she's not annoyed at the woman who took her seat but at the one who made her move. So, the conflict is between the author and the elderly woman.\n\nNow, considering social norms, people often offer seats to those who seem more in need, like the elderly, pregnant, or disabled. The author had already taken a seat, but the elderly woman might have felt she needed both seats more. However, the author was pregnant, which is a protected status in many places for seating priority. \n\nThe problem here might be that the elderly woman assumed the author didn't need the seat, not realizing she was pregnant. The author's annoyance is valid because she felt her needs were overlooked. But is that enough to say she's in the wrong? The author did give up her seat without confrontation, which aligns with her usual behavior of offering seats to others. \n\nOn the other hand, if the elderly woman didn't realize the author was pregnant, maybe the author could have explained. But since the pregnancy wasn't visible when sitting, the elderly woman had no way of knowing. The author might feel that her discomfort wasn't acknowledged. \n\nLegally, in many places, pregnant women have the right to sit, but in this case, the author chose to move, which she did. So, she wasn't in the wrong for moving, but maybe the elderly woman was in the wrong for not recognizing her need. \n\nThe author's annoyance stems from feeling shamed, which is understandable. She might be hormonal due to pregnancy, but that doesn't make her right. However, the main question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she gave up the seat willingly and there's no indication she was rude or confrontational, she's probably not in the wrong. The elderly woman might have been the one in the wrong for not considering the author's situation. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong). The author acted appropriately by offering her seat and didn't confront the elderly woman unnecessarily. Her annoyance is valid given the circumstances.\n"
