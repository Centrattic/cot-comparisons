I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about giving up a seat at a bus stop.\n\nThe author is a pregnant student with a long commute. She took a seat at the bus station after a tiring day. An elderly woman next to her told her to give the seat to another woman who was standing. The author, feeling embarrassed, gave up her seat. She's now annoyed with the woman who shamed her into doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are her physical state: pregnant, 5 months along, which isn't visible when sitting. She's exhausted from commuting. The other woman standing wasn't in obvious distress. The elderly woman pressured her into giving up the seat.\n\nPublic transport etiquette often involves offering seats to those who need them more. But in this case, the author was already seated and had a valid reason to be there (pregnancy). The elderly woman's action might have been inappropriate, as she forced the author to give up her seat without considering her condition. \n\nThe author didn't want confrontation and gave in, but she's now questioning if she was right to be annoyed. Since she's pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable, especially towards the end of the day, her need for a seat is legitimate. The other woman wasn't showing signs of needing a seat, so the author shouldn't feel obligated to give it up. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue was the elderly woman's behavior, not the author's decision to give up the seat. The author's annoyance is understandable because she was treated as if she didn't deserve the seat despite her own valid reasons. So the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
