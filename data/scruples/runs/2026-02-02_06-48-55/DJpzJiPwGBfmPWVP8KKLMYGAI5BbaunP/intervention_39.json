I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me consider all the details.\n\nFirst, the author is a pregnant student who commutes a long distance, which leaves her exhausted. She takes a seat at the bus station, which is free initially. Then an elderly woman sits next to her. Later, another woman arrives, not elderly, and the elderly woman tells the author to give her seat to that woman. The author, feeling embarrassed, complies. The author is upset because she felt shamed into giving up her seat, especially since her pregnancy wasn't visible when sitting.\n\nThe key points here are about appropriateness of the elderly woman's actions and the author's reaction. The elderly woman might have thought the standing woman needed the seat more, but the author was also pregnant, which could be a valid reason to keep the seat. However, the author didn't mention her condition immediately, which might have led to the misunderstanding. The author then chose not to confront the situation, which she's now questioning.\n\nThe author isn't upset at the woman who took the seat but at the elderly woman who pressured her. The author does mention that she usually offers her seat if someone needs it more, which shows consideration. The situation might have been a miscommunication. The elderly woman might not have known about the author's pregnancy. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. She followed the social norm of giving up her seat when someone else is in need, even if it wasn't necessary. The elderly woman might have overstepped, but the author's reaction\u2014complying without confrontation\u2014is understandable given her personality. She didn't act aggressively or refuse help. The fact that her condition wasn't visible when sitting could also be a factor. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
