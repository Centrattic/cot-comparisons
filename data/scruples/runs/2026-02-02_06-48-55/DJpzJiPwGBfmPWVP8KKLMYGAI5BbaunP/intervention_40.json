I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, who is a pregnant student commuting a long distance, being asked by an elderly woman to give up their seat for another woman. The author felt shamed into doing so, even though they were already sitting, which became obvious when they stood up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a long, tiring commute and is 5 months pregnant. They were sitting in a bus station waiting for their bus. Another woman was standing nearby, and the elderly woman next to the author told the author to give up their seat to that woman. The author did so, feeling embarrassed and annoyed later about it.\n\nThe key points here are the author's physical condition and the social expectations around giving up seats. The author was already sitting when the other woman arrived. Typically, if someone is already seated and someone else needs a seat, the person already seated generally keeps it unless they volunteer to give it up. However, the elderly woman's intervention might have pressured the author, who is pregnant, into giving up their seat. \n\nPregnancy can bring physical discomfort, and the author mentions being exhausted from a long day. The seat was taken because the author's posture made their pregnancy less visible when sitting. When they stood up, it became obvious they were pregnant. The author is not upset with the woman who took the seat but with the elderly woman who pressured them.\n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation to offer seats to those who are elderly, disabled, or pregnant. However, the situation here is that the author was already seated and not being disruptive. The elderly woman's action might have been based on her own judgment, perhaps not realizing the author's condition. The author, being in a vulnerable state, felt shamed into giving up the seat, which they later felt was unfair.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had a valid reason to need the seat (pregnancy, exhaustion) and were not in the wrong for keeping it. The elderly woman's action was perhaps misguided, but the author's reaction of being annoyed is understandable given their circumstances. The author isn't being selfish here because they had a legitimate need. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
