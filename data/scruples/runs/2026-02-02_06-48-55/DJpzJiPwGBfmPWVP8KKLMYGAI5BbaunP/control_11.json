I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed about giving up their seat. The situation is that the author is a pregnant student with a long commute, sitting in a bus station where an elderly woman tells them to give up their seat to another woman. The author did give up the seat but is annoyed at the elderly woman.\n\nFirst, the author is pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable, especially later in pregnancy. They've had a long day of commuting, which is tiring. The bus station seats were all taken except the one they were sitting on, so they had a legitimate reason to need a seat. The elderly woman's action of pointing out the author's seat as an option might be well-intentioned, thinking the other woman might need it more. But the author felt shamed into giving up their seat. The key here is whether the author had a right to the seat. Since the seats were first-come, the author was there first. The other woman didn't seem to be in distress. The author's pregnancy was more visible when standing, so maybe the elderly woman didn't realize. The author isn't annoyed at the woman who took the seat, just the one who pressured them. So, the author's annoyance is understandable. They were in a situation where they needed rest, and being asked to give up a seat they had a right to could be frustrating. There's no indication the author is in the wrong here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
