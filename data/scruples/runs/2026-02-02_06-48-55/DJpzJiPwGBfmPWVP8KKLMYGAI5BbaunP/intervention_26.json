I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who is a pregnant student, took a seat at the bus station. Then an elderly woman next to her told her to give the seat to another woman who was standing. The author was annoyed because she felt the elderly woman shamed her into giving up her seat, even though she was pregnant and had a long, tiring commute.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable, especially later in the pregnancy. She has a long commute and is tired. The bus station has limited seats, and when she sat down, the other seats were free. Then, after others took those seats, the elderly woman asked her to give up her seat. The author complied but felt wronged.\n\nNow, societal norms about giving up seats: Usually, pregnant people are considered to be in need of a seat, so others might offer. But if someone is already seated, maybe they have a right to stay. The elderly woman might have thought that the standing woman needed the seat more. However, the elderly woman's approach might have been harsh. The author didn't do anything wrong by sitting there, especially since the seat was free when she sat down.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that she's willing to give up her seat if someone needs it more, but in this case, the elderly woman's shaming made her feel like she had to. The key point is that the author was pregnant and had a valid need for the seat. The elderly woman's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because she didn't ask politely or consider the author's situation.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have offered the seat to the standing woman herself without being prompted. But the author says she would do so if she thought the other person needed it more. Since the standing woman didn't show any discomfort, maybe the author didn't realize she needed the seat. The elderly woman's intervention might have been unnecessary.\n\nIn terms of who's at fault, the elderly woman's behavior seems problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for taking a seat that was available and then being asked to give it up in a shaming way. The author's annoyance is understandable given her situation. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
