I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe person is a pregnant university student who commutes a long distance each day. At the end of the day, they're exhausted and take a seat at the bus station. An elderly woman sits next to them. Then another woman approaches, and the elderly woman tells the seated person to give up their seat to this other woman. The author complies, feeling embarrassed, and now they're wondering if they were in the wrong for being annoyed at the elderly woman.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The author is pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable, especially later in the pregnancy. They've had a long commute and are tired. The elderly woman is likely trying to help someone who might need a seat, but maybe she misjudged the situation. The other woman didn't seem to need the seat, as she wasn't showing discomfort.\n\nThe key points here are about offering seats to those in need. Generally, people are expected to give up seats for others, especially if they can. The author mentions that they always do this when they think someone needs it more. But in this case, the author was sitting in a seat that was free when they arrived. Then others, including the elderly woman, took the remaining seats. The other woman wasn't obviously in need, so maybe the elderly woman assumed she was. The author was pregnant, which might not have been noticeable when sitting, but when standing, it is. The elderly woman might not have realized the author's condition.\n\nNow, the author is annoyed at the elderly woman for making them give up the seat. Is that justified? Well, the author was already in a seat that they had a right to take. If the elderly woman felt the other woman needed it more, perhaps she should have asked the author politely. But the author was pregnant, which is a valid reason to keep a seat. The elderly woman's action might have been well-intentioned but misinformed. The author's annoyance might stem from feeling their own needs were overlooked, and the situation made them uncomfortable.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had a valid reason to want to keep the seat, and the elderly woman's judgment about who needed it more might have been incorrect. The author's reaction is more about the elderly woman's misjudgment than their own fault. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
