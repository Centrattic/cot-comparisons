I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is pregnant, exhausted from a long commute, and sitting in a bus station waiting area. An elderly woman tells her to give up her seat to another woman who is standing. The author does so, but feels annoyed at being shamed.\n\nFirst, the author is 5 months pregnant, which isn't always visible when sitting. When she stands, her pregnancy is obvious. So maybe the elderly woman didn't realize she was pregnant because she couldn't see it when she was sitting. The author mentions that she's exhausted from a long day and her commute. She also states that she's not annoyed at the woman who took the seat but at the one who made her give it up.\n\nThe key question is whether the elderly woman had the right to make her give up her seat. Public seating is usually first-come, first-served, unless someone is visibly in need (like elderly, pregnant, disabled). The elderly woman might have thought the standing woman needed the seat more, but the author was also pregnant and likely tired. However, since the author's pregnancy wasn't visible when sitting, maybe the elderly woman didn't know. \n\nThe author says she always offers her seat to someone who needs it more, but in this case, she didn't get a chance to decide because the elderly woman intervened. The author didn't do anything wrong by taking the seat first. The elderly woman's action might have been well-intentioned but inconsiderate of the author's situation. The author's annoyance is understandable because she was treated as if she wasn't entitled to the seat she had.\n\nSo, considering the circumstances, the author isn't in the wrong. The elderly woman made an assumption that might have been incorrect, and the author was in her right to keep the seat unless someone more visibly needed it. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
