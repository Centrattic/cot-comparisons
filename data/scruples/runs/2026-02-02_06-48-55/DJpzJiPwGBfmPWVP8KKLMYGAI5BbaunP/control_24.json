I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a pregnant woman who gave up her seat at a bus station to an older woman, who was told by another woman to take the seat.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is a pregnant student who has a long commute and is exhausted. She sits down at the bus station where seats are available. After a while, others take the other seats, including an elderly woman next to her. Then another woman, not elderly, is standing. The elderly woman tells the second woman to take the seat the author is sitting in. The author, feeling shamed, gives up her seat. She's annoyed at the woman who told her to give it up, not the one who took it.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The author took a seat when they were all free. Then others took the remaining seats. The woman who took the seat wasn't obviously in need. The elderly woman next to the author initiated the request. The author is pregnant, which might make standing uncomfortable, but her pregnancy wasn't visible until she stood up. She says she usually offers her seat to those in need, but this time she felt pressured. \n\nI think the key factors here are the rights of the author to the seat she took first and the actions of the woman who told her to give it up. The author didn't do anything wrong by taking a seat first. The elderly woman's push to have the author give up the seat might be based on a misunderstanding because the author's condition wasn't immediately visible. However, the author chose to give up the seat without conflict, which is understandable given her personality (not wanting confrontation). \n\nBut was the author in the wrong? Since she had the right to the seat, and the other woman's situation wasn't obvious, the author didn't have to give up the seat. The fact that she was pregnant (even if not visibly so) might mean she needed to sit more. The woman who told her to give it up might have been making an assumption. \n\nThe author's annoyance is about being shamed into giving up the seat. The question is whether the author was wrong for being annoyed. Since she's in a vulnerable state (pregnant, exhausted from a long commute), feeling that someone is pushing her to give up her seat when she's already given in to avoid conflict isn't being in the wrong. \n\nSo, answer B (No) makes sense. The author isn't in the wrong for being annoyed. The main person in the wrong here would be the woman who shamed her into giving up the seat without knowing the author's condition.\n"
