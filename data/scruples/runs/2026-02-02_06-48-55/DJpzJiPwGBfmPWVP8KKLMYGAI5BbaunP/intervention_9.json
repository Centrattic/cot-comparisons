I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about giving up a seat on the bus. The author is a pregnant student with a long commute, and after sitting down, an elderly woman tells her to give the seat to another woman. The author complies but is annoyed at the elderly woman because she felt shamed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is pregnant, which is a valid reason to need a seat, especially since her pregnancy is visible when standing. But when sitting, it's not obvious. The elderly woman next to her might have thought the other woman needed the seat more. But the key here is that the author was already sitting and the other woman wasn't showing any discomfort. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she wasn't forced to give up the seat. She chose to do so to avoid confrontation. The elderly woman's action might have been overstepping, but the author's reaction is annoyance towards her. The author doesn't seem to blame the woman who took the seat. \n\nThe author mentions that she usually offers her seat to those in need, which is considerate. However, in this case, she might have felt that her own need (due to pregnancy and long day) was valid. The elderly woman's assertion could have made her feel that her own need wasn't acknowledged. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she gave up the seat without being asked directly (the elderly woman just told her), maybe she wasn't in the wrong. She had the right to sit, especially as a pregnant person. The elderly woman's behavior might have been inappropriate. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she was acting on the elderly woman's suggestion and didn't have to give up the seat. Her pregnancy is a valid reason to need a seat, and she wasn't confrontational. The elderly woman's actions were the issue here, not the author's.\n"
