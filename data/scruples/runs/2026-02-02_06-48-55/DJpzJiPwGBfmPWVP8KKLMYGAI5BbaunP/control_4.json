I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a pregnant woman giving up her seat at a bus station after being asked by an elderly woman, who then tells another woman to take the seat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable, especially towards the end of the day after a long commute. She mentions being exhausted from a long journey. The bus station has limited seats, and others start taking them. An elderly woman, who is next to her, points to her and tells the other woman to take her seat. The author gives up the seat out of embarrassment because her pregnancy isn't visible when sitting but is obvious when standing.\n\nNow, evaluating if she's in the wrong. Public transportation etiquette often encourages giving up seats to those who need them more. However, the author had been sitting there first. The elderly woman's actions might be seen as inappropriate, as she's trying to get someone to take the author's seat. The author was already in a vulnerable state (pregnant, tired) and felt shamed into giving up the seat. She later mentions she's not annoyed at the woman who took the seat but at the one who pressured her out of it.\n\nLegally and socially, there's no rule that makes giving up a seat mandatory. The author had the right to keep her seat unless someone needed it more. The elderly woman might have overstepped by publicly shaming her. Also, the author's pregnancy could be a valid reason to have the seat, but others might not realize that just from her sitting. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She acted politely and gave up the seat, but the pressure from the elderly woman was unwarranted. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
