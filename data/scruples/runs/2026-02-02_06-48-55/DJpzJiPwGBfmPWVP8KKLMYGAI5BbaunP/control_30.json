I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a pregnant student who commutes a long way and is exhausted. At the bus station, she sits down and someone else takes her seat. An elderly woman tells her to give the seat to another woman. She feels shamed into giving it up, but the main issue is with the woman who made the request, not the one who took the seat.\n\nFirst, the author's situation: pregnant, tired from a long commute, and clearly in need of a seat. The elderly woman's action was to point out that the seat should go to someone else. The author gave up the seat but feels wronged because she was pressured.\n\nThe key points here are: Is the author in the wrong for being annoyed? The options are A or B. The author isn't mad at the woman who took the seat but at the one who made her give it up. The elderly woman's behavior might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the author's condition wasn't visible until she stood up. Since the author is pregnant and exhausted, others might not realize her need for a seat. The elderly woman's action could be seen as judgmental without knowing the full context.\n\nIn public settings, people often assume who needs a seat more based on appearance. The author's pregnancy isn't obvious when sitting, so maybe the elderly woman didn't realize. However, once the author stood up, it became clear. The author's annoyance is directed at being made to feel guilty for taking a seat she needed. Since she wasn't confrontational and gave up the seat, she's not in the wrong for her actions. The real issue is the other woman's judgment. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
