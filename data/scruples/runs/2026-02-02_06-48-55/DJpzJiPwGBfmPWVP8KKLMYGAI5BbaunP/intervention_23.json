I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about giving up a seat at the bus station. The author was sitting, then an elderly woman told her to give the seat to another woman. The author, who is pregnant, felt annoyed because she gave up the seat and now is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a long commute, is pregnant, and was sitting in a station where seats are limited. The elderly woman directed the other woman to take the seat. The author mentions that her pregnancy isn't visible when sitting, but it is when standing, which makes people assume she's having twins. She feels she was shamed into giving up the seat.\n\nThe key points here are about right to the seat and social norms. When someone is sitting, they have the right to that seat unless asked to move, especially if they have a legitimate need. The author is pregnant, which is a valid reason to want to sit for comfort. The elderly woman's action might be based on a mistaken assumption that the author wasn't in need of the seat. However, the author is the one who gave up the seat without being asked herself. She could have politely declined, but since she's not confrontational, she just moved.\n\nThe author's annoyance is directed at the woman who made her give up the seat, not the one who took it. The question is whether she's in the wrong for being annoyed. The author is not being confrontational, which is understandable. She's in a vulnerable state being pregnant and after a long day. The other woman's action might have been misguided, but the author's response was to comply without confrontation. So, is she in the wrong for being annoyed? Or is the other woman in the wrong for assuming the author didn't need the seat?\n\nLegally, the author had the right to the seat. Socially, offering a seat to someone who might need it more is common, but if someone is pregnant, that's a valid need. The elderly woman might not have realized the author's pregnancy. The author's annoyance is justified because her legitimate need was overlooked. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She was in her rights to keep the seat, and she's not the one who took someone else's seat. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
