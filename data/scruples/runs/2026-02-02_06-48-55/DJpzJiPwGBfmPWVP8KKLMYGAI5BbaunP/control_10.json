I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for getting annoyed about giving up their seat. The situation involves a pregnant woman who took a seat at a busy bus station, then an elderly woman told her to give it to another woman nearby.\n\nFirst, the pregnant woman's situation is pretty tough. She's been on a long commute, 2 hours on a bus, and is 5 months pregnant. Her feet are sore, and the seat was a relief. When she sits down, others take the other seats, including an elderly woman next to her. Then a standing woman is nearby, not showing distress. The elderly woman then points out to her that the standing woman should sit, and the pregnant woman, feeling shamed, gives up her seat.\n\nThe key points here are: the seat was taken before the elderly woman's intervention. The pregnant woman was there first, but maybe the standing woman needed it more. However, the elderly woman's approach might have been inconsiderate, making the pregnant woman feel shamed. The user is annoyed at the elderly woman for that.\n\nThe user isn't angry at the woman who took the seat, but at the one who made her feel bad. The user also mentions that they usually give up seats when they think someone needs it more. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for feeling annoyed.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, people often expect others to give up seats for those in need, but sometimes the way it's done can be rude. The elderly woman's method might have been shaming, which is unkind. The pregnant woman's reaction is annoyance, which is understandable given her physical state and the circumstances.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the user isn't in the wrong. She was there first, and the elderly woman's shaming approach was inappropriate. The user handled it by giving up the seat, which is considerate, but being annoyed at the way she was treated is valid. She's not wrong for feeling that way.\n"
