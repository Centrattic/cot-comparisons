I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed about giving up their seat at the bus stop. The situation involves the author being pregnant, which isn't visible until they stand, and an elderly woman insisting they give the seat to another woman who wasn't showing any need.\n\nFirst, the author's situation: They have a long commute, are pregnant, and were sitting in a bus station waiting. They mention that seats were scarce but initially free. After taking one, others including an elderly woman sat down. Then another woman was standing nearby, not showing discomfort. The elderly woman then told the author to give the seat to the standing woman. The author did so, but is now annoyed at the elderly woman for making them feel shamed.\n\nKey points to consider:\n\n1. The author is pregnant, which can affect mobility and comfort, even if not visibly obvious when sitting. However, the visibility here is a factor since others didn't realize until they stood up.\n\n2. The elderly woman next to the author initiated the interaction. She might have assumed the standing woman needed the seat more, possibly not noticing the author's pregnancy. But the author might feel that their own needs were overlooked, especially given their pregnancy and long journey.\n\n3. The author mentions they usually offer seats to others if needed, so this isn't about selfishness. However, being pregnant, even if not obvious, might mean they need a seat more than someone else, especially after a tiring day.\n\n4. The elderly woman's action could be seen as misguided, as she didn't assess the situation correctly. The author might feel disrespected or shamed for their need not being recognized.\n\n5. The author's annoyance is directed at the elderly woman, not the woman who took the seat. That's important because it shows the author isn't upset about losing the seat to someone else but the way it was enforced.\n\n6. The bus station seats are limited, but the author was there first. The woman who took the seat was standing, but maybe didn't need it as much as the author. Since the elderly woman didn't consider the author's visible condition (once standing), her judgment was flawed.\n\nFrom a societal standpoint, offering a seat to someone who appears older or in need is common, but in this case, the author's hidden condition (pregnancy) wasn't visible when seated. The elderly woman's assumption might have been incorrect, leading to the author feeling wronged. The author isn't in the wrong for being annoyed because their legitimate need wasn't recognized, and they were pressured to give up the seat despite that. The elderly woman's action was possibly inconsiderate, as she didn't take into account the author's actual condition once they stood up.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
