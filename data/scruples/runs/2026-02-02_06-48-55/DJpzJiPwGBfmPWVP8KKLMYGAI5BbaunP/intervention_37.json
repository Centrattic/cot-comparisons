I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a pregnant woman, five months along, commuting a long distance each day. She's tired from her long bus rides and the large university campus. At the bus station, there are seats available, which she takes. Then, over time, the other seats get occupied, including by an elderly woman next to her. Then a standing woman is nearby. The elderly woman points out to the standing woman that the author's seat is available, leading the author to give up her seat. The author is annoyed at the elderly woman for making her feel shamed.\n\nNow, the key points here are about whether the author was in the wrong. The author is pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable, especially after a long day. However, the elderly woman and the standing woman might each have claims to a seat. The elderly woman might have been there first, and the standing woman might have mobility issues not immediately obvious. The author's pregnancy wasn't visible when sitting but became apparent when standing.\n\nThe author mentions she usually offers her seat to those in need. In this case, the elderly woman directed the standing woman to the author's seat. The author felt shamed and gave up the seat. The question is whether the author was wrong to be annoyed.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often offer seats to those who need it more, like the elderly, pregnant, or disabled. However, if the author was already seated and the others arrived later, maybe she's within her rights to keep her seat. But since she's pregnant, there's an expectation that others would yield to her. However, the elderly woman might not know she's pregnant. The author's own admission is that she's okay with giving up the seat if someone else needs it more, but in this case, she felt pressured.\n\nThe author's annoyance is directed at the elderly woman for making her feel shamed. But maybe the elderly woman was trying to help the standing woman, not knowing the author's condition. The author might be in the wrong for taking offense, since the elderly woman was trying to act kindly, even if it was a misunderstanding. Alternatively, the author could be justified in her annoyance if she genuinely felt the seat was needed more by her due to her pregnancy.\n\nBut considering that the seat was occupied by the elderly woman after the author took hers, maybe there's a chain of events where the elderly woman had a seat first, and the standing woman arrived later. If the elderly woman invited the standing woman to take the author's seat, maybe that's a misjudgment on her part. The author, being pregnant, might have a stronger claim. However, the author gave up the seat without confrontation. The question is whether she was wrong to be annoyed.\n\nIn public transport etiquette, it's generally accepted that pregnant women should be offered a seat. If the elderly woman didn't realize the author was pregnant, then it's a misunderstanding. The author's annoyance might be justified because her need wasn't recognized. However, if the author had made her condition more visible (like a seatbelt or a sign), maybe others would know. But since she's in her fifth month and the belly isn't visible when sitting, others can't know unless she stands up. The elderly woman might not know and is trying to help the standing woman, so she's acting in good faith.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because her need (pregnancy) is a valid reason to keep the seat, even if it wasn't obvious. The elderly woman's action could be seen as a mistake, not intentional. Therefore, the author's annoyance is understandable. However, the author chose to give up the seat without confrontation, which is polite, but her annoyance at being shamed is valid. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
