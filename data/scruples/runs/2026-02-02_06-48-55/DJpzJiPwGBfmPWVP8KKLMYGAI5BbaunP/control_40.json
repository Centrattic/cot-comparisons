I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nSo, the author is a pregnant student who commutes a long distance for university. At the city's central bus station, they take a seat because they're exhausted. Then an elderly woman next to them tells another woman to sit in the author's seat. The author gives up the seat out of embarrassment, even though the other woman wasn't obviously in need. The author is annoyed at the elderly woman for making them feel shamed.\n\nFirst, the author is pregnant, which is a valid reason for needing a seat, especially since she's 5 months along and her belly is visible when standing. The elderly woman might have thought the other woman, who wasn't showing distress, needed the seat more. But the author was already sitting there, and the seats were taken. However, the author gave up the seat because of the elderly woman's insistence, not because the other woman needed it.\n\nThe key points: Was the author in the wrong for getting annoyed? The author says they're usually willing to give up their seat if someone needs it more. Here, the other woman didn't show any signs of needing the seat. The author felt shamed into giving it up. \n\nThe elderly woman's actions might be well-intentioned, but it's possible she misjudged the situation. The author isn't angry at the woman who took the seat but at the one who pressured them. Since the author didn't do anything wrong by taking the seat first and the elderly woman's intervention might have been unnecessary, the author's annoyance is justified. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
