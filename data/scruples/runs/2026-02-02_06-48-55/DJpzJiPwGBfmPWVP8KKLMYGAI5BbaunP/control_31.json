I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed after giving up their seat at the bus stop. Let me try to break this down.\n\nSo the situation: The author is a pregnant university student with a long commute. After a tiring day, they sit down at the bus station where seats are available. An elderly woman then tells a nearby woman to take the author's seat. The author, feeling embarrassed, gives up the seat. The main issue is the author's annoyance towards the elderly woman who shamed them into giving up the seat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is pregnant (5 months, which isn't visible when sitting but is when standing), and they have a long, tiring commute. They took a seat when they were available, and later when someone else needed to sit, the elderly woman directed the other woman to the author's seat. The author gave up the seat but is now annoyed about it.\n\nNow, the key points. The author mentions they usually offer their seat to someone who needs it more. They also state they wouldn't expect others to give up their seat for them. So, their usual behavior is considerate. In this case, they were sitting when they had the right to be there (since the seats were free). The elderly woman's action might have been trying to be helpful, thinking the author was not visibly pregnant. However, the author felt shamed and had to move.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. Legally, there's no obligation to give up a seat unless there are specific rules. Public transport policies often encourage giving up seats for those in need, but it's not mandatory. In this case, the author was sitting first and had a valid reason (pregnancy, fatigue from a long journey). The elderly woman's interference might have been unnecessary and possibly incorrect, as the author's need wasn't obvious until they stood up.\n\nThe author's annoyance is directed at the elderly woman for making them feel shamed. The real issue is the judgment from the third party, not the other woman who took the seat. The author's reaction is understandable because their own situation was overlooked. They didn't do anything wrong by sitting there first; the elderly woman's assumption might have been based on a misunderstanding (not seeing the pregnancy when the author was sitting).\n\nAlso, the author mentions not being confrontational, so their choice to just comply without arguing is their right. They're questioning if their annoyance is justified. Considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The elderly woman's actions were possibly misguided. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
