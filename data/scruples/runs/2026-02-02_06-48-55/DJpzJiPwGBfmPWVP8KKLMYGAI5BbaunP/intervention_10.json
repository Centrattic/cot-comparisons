I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong when they gave up their seat at the bus station based on a situation described. The author is a pregnant student with a long commute, and after sitting down, an elderly woman told another woman to sit in their seat. The author gave up the seat, but now they're feeling annoyed and wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is pregnant, which typically makes people expect others to offer seats. However, in this case, the author had already taken a seat, and others were taking the other seats as well. The elderly woman directed another woman to the author's seat. The author gave it up because they felt shamed, but later realized that their pregnancy wasn't visible when sitting but was when standing. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author had a valid need (pregnancy) for a seat, 2) The seat wasn't reserved for others, 3) The elderly woman's actions might have been a misunderstanding or assumption. The author gave up the seat without confrontation, which they admit to being their nature. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. If someone has a legitimate need (pregnancy) for a seat, others might expect them to have priority. The elderly woman might have thought the author's pregnancy wasn't visible, leading her to direct the other woman to sit there. However, the author's discomfort is about feeling shamed and giving up the seat. But since they mentioned they usually give up seats to others when they think someone needs it more, maybe their annoyance is more about the situation than the other person's action. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. The woman who was told to sit was just following the elderly woman's direction, and the author's own needs were valid. The real issue might be the elderly woman's assumption, not the author's decision to give up the seat. The author isn't being an asshole for feeling annoyed, but they might be overthinking it. So, the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
