I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about giving up a seat at a bus stop. \n\nThe writer is a pregnant student with a long commute. She took a seat at the bus station, and then an elderly woman told her to give it to another woman. The writer was pregnant, which isn't visible when sitting, but becomes obvious when standing. She gave up the seat out of embarrassment and not wanting confrontation.\n\nFirst, the key points: She's pregnant, which should give her a reason to need a seat. The elderly woman's action was shaming her into giving up the seat. The writer didn't want confrontation, so she complied. The question is whether she was wrong to be annoyed about this.\n\nPregnancy can make standing uncomfortable, especially in later months. The writer had a long day, so sitting was important. The elderly woman's action might have been based on not knowing the writer was pregnant. However, the writer was already seated first, and the other woman wasn't showing signs of needing the seat. \n\nIn public transport etiquette, usually, people are expected to offer seats to those who need them more. But here, the writer was already seated. The elderly woman's intervention might have been unnecessary. The writer's annoyance is justified because she had a legitimate reason to be seated. The woman who took the seat didn't seem to need it. \n\nAlso, the writer mentions she would offer her seat if someone needed it more, but in this case, she was there first and had valid reasons. The elderly woman's shaming might have been the real issue here. The writer isn't being inconsiderate; she's reacting to an unfair situation where she was pressured to give up a seat she needed. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She had a right to the seat, and the elderly woman's actions were the problem. The writer's annoyance is justified.\n"
