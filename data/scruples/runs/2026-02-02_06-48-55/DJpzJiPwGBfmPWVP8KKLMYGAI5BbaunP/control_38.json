I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about giving up a seat at a bus stop. Let me break it down.\n\nThe author is a student commuting a long way, 2 hours each way, and they're 5 months pregnant. They're exhausted after a long day. They sit down at the bus station, and an elderly woman tells them to give the seat to another woman who's standing. The author complies, feeling embarrassed. The key points here: the author was sitting, the other woman wasn't showing any distress, and the author's pregnancy isn't visible when sitting but is when standing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable, especially later in pregnancy. However, they mention that their pregnancy wasn't noticeable when sitting. The elderly woman might have thought the author wasn't pregnant because they looked fat when sitting. But when the author stood up, it became obvious. \n\nThe author isn't mad at the woman who took the seat but at the elderly woman who pressured them. They also mention they usually offer seats to those in need. The author gave up the seat without confrontation, which they regret a bit. \n\nLegally and ethically, is there an obligation to give up a seat? In many public transport systems, there are priority seating areas for pregnant, elderly, or disabled people. But if the seat isn't marked, it's more about social norms. The elderly woman might have thought the standing woman needed the seat more, but the author had been sitting there first and was pregnant. \n\nThe author's annoyance is because they felt shamed into giving up the seat. They might have felt their need (pregnancy) wasn't recognized. The elderly woman's action could be seen as overstepping, assuming the author wasn't pregnant. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author didn't do anything wrong; they were in a public space, sitting, and gave up the seat when asked. However, maybe the author is justified in feeling wronged because the elderly woman didn't consider the author's situation. But the author didn't confront her, just gave up the seat. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They were pregnant, had a long commute, and gave up the seat. The real issue is the elderly woman's assumption. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
