I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is a pregnant student with a long, tiring commute. They're at a bus station, sit down because they're exhausted, and then an elderly woman tells them they have to give up their seat to someone else. The person gives up the seat because they feel shamed, even though they were visibly pregnant when standing.\n\nFirst, the situation: Pregnant women, especially in later months, often need to sit more due to physical discomfort. The author mentions their pregnancy is 5 months, not yet visible when sitting but obvious when standing. The elderly woman might have thought the other woman (the one standing) was in more need, but the author was also in a vulnerable state. The key here is whether it's reasonable to give up a seat when being pregnant and exhausted, especially if others are already sitting.\n\nThe bus station seats were all taken except the author's spot. The elderly woman told the author to give up their seat. The author complied, not out of choice but because they felt shamed. The question is if the author was wrong to be annoyed by that.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, pregnant women are often expected to be offered seats. However, in this case, the author was already sitting and the seat was theirs first. The elderly woman's action could be seen as inconsiderate, assuming the other woman needed it more without knowing the author's situation. The author wasn't being unkind; they offered their seat but were pressured to give it up. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
