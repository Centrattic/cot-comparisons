I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for getting annoyed after giving up their seat at the bus stop. The author is a pregnant student with a long commute, which is tiring. She took a seat at the bus station, and an elderly woman then insisted she give it to another woman who wasn't showing any signs of needing a seat. The author felt shamed into giving up her seat, even though her pregnancy wasn't obvious until she stood up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is pregnant, which might make standing uncomfortable, especially after a long day. She's also dealing with a two-hour bus ride and a big university campus. The elderly woman's action seems to have been based on a misunderstanding, as the other woman didn't look like she needed a seat. The author didn't want confrontation, so she complied, but now feels annoyed.\n\nThe key points here are: the author had a legitimate need (pregnancy, fatigue), the other woman wasn't obviously in need, and the elderly woman's intervention was maybe misguided. The author isn't upset with the woman who took the seat, but with the one who pressured her. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for being annoyed.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people generally offer seats to those who need them more. The author did take the offer when it was given, but the issue is the pressure she felt. She wasn't being confrontational, just following the suggestion. Since her condition wasn't immediately visible, maybe the elderly woman didn't realize she was pregnant. The author isn't refusing to give up a seat if someone needs it, but in this case, the other person didn't seem to need it. So the author's annoyance is justified because she was made to feel guilty for sitting, even though her situation was more deserving. Therefore, she isn't in the wrong.\n"
