I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about giving up a seat at a bus stop. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is pregnant, 5 months along. She's exhausted from a long commute involving multiple buses, walking, and a big university campus. She's at the central bus station, where there were seats available when she arrived. She sits down, and soon others take the other seats, including an elderly woman next to her. Then another woman comes over, not showing discomfort, and the elderly woman tells her to sit where the author was. The author gives up her seat, feeling shamed, even though her pregnancy wasn't visible when sitting but obvious when standing. She's annoyed at the elderly woman for making her give up the seat, not the one who took it.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A or B.\n\nFrom what I understand, the author took a seat that was free when she arrived. Then others, including the elderly woman, took the other seats. The other woman standing wasn't in obvious need. The elderly woman's action of directing the other woman to take the author's seat could be problematic, especially considering the author's condition. Since the author is pregnant and likely in need of sitting for comfort and health reasons, being asked to give up her seat might not be appropriate. Also, the elderly woman might have assumed the other woman was in more need, but the author's situation (pregnancy, exhaustion) could be more critical.\n\nLegally and ethically, there's no law against sitting in a bus station, but social norms often involve offering seats to those in need. However, the author was already seated first. The elderly woman's insistence might be overstepping. The author didn't force the seat on the other woman, but she felt pressured to give it up. Since her pregnancy wasn't obvious when sitting, maybe others didn't realize her need. However, she's not wrong for wanting to keep the seat for her own well-being. She even mentions that she usually offers her seat if someone needs it more, which shows she's considerate. In this case, the elderly woman's action was perhaps rude, and the author was within her rights to be annoyed. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
