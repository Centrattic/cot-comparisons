I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a pregnant woman who was sitting at a bus station and was told by an elderly woman to give up her seat for another woman. She did so and is now wondering if she was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The woman is 5 months pregnant, which isn't visible when sitting but is obvious when standing. She's exhausted from a long commute and took a seat at the bus station. Another woman stood nearby, and the elderly woman next to the author told the standing woman to take the author's seat. The author gave up the seat, feeling shamed, and is now upset about it.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author's right to the seat, the visibility of her pregnancy, and the social etiquette involved. The elderly woman's action in directing someone else to take the seat might be the key. \n\nIn many cultures, pregnant women are considered to need seating for comfort and safety, especially in their later months. However, the author mentions that her pregnancy wasn't visible until she stood up. So when she was sitting, the elderly woman might not have known she was pregnant. That could be a factor. The elderly woman might have thought the standing woman needed the seat more, perhaps due to age or other visible signs.\n\nThe author isn't upset with the woman who took the seat but with the one who shamed her into giving it up. The question is whether the author was wrong to be annoyed. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that.\n\nLegally, seats in public transport are first-come, first-served unless there's a designated space for the elderly, disabled, or pregnant. In this case, it's a bus station, not the bus itself. So, there's no rule forcing the author to give up her seat. Socially, people often offer seats to those in need, but it's a choice, not an obligation. The elderly woman might have acted without knowing the author's situation.\n\nThe author did offer her seat, which shows she's considerate. However, if the elderly woman's action was based on misinformation (not knowing the author was pregnant), then the author's annoyance is understandable. The author might feel that her right to rest after a long day was respected, especially since her pregnancy isn't visible when sitting. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset at being shamed into giving up a seat she had a right to.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. The elderly woman's actions were possibly misguided, and the author's annoyance is justified because she had every right to the seat, especially when her condition wasn't apparent to others.\n"
