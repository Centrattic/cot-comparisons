I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about giving up a seat at a bus stop.\n\nThe author is a pregnant student with a long commute, which leaves her exhausted. She takes a seat at the bus station, and after some time, an elderly woman asks her to give it to another woman. The author complies but feels annoyed, especially since her pregnancy isn't obvious when sitting. She's wondering if she was in the wrong for being annoyed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. She's pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable, especially later in pregnancy. Public transport often has policies about giving up seats for those in need. But the key here is that the elderly woman shamed her into giving up the seat. The author mentions that when she stood up, her pregnancy was visible, which might explain why the other woman took the seat. \n\nThe author didn't seem to have a confrontational intent. She's stated that she's willing to give up her seat if someone needs it more. However, in this case, the elderly woman's actions might have been based on a misunderstanding. The author was sitting because she was pregnant and tired, but since her condition wasn't obvious until she stood, the other woman might not have known. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to be annoyed. The author feels shamed, which is a valid emotional response. But was she in the wrong for keeping the seat initially? Public transport policies often prioritize the elderly, disabled, and pregnant. Since she's pregnant, she might have a right to the seat. However, if the other woman was also in need (elderly, perhaps), the situation is a bit tricky. \n\nBut the author mentions that the elderly woman who asked her to move was next to her. Maybe the elderly woman didn't realize the author was pregnant. The author gave up the seat without being asked directly and without confrontation, which shows consideration. Her annoyance is at being shamed, not at the other woman taking the seat. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's in a situation where her need (pregnancy) is valid, but the elderly woman might have acted out of good intentions without full information. The author's annoyance is understandable because she felt shamed, but she wasn't wrong to be in the seat. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
