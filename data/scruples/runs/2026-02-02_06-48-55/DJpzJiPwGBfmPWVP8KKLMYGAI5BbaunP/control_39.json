I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're a pregnant student with a long commute. They took a seat at the bus station because they were exhausted, and then another woman was standing nearby. The elderly woman next to the author told her to sit on the author's seat. The author then offered their seat to the woman, maybe because they felt shamed or just being polite. But now they're annoyed at the elderly woman for making them give up the seat.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons for needing a seat: they're pregnant (5 months, not visible unless standing), have a long and tiring commute, and are probably in a lot of discomfort. Pregnancy can cause fatigue and the need for rest, especially later on. Even if the seat wasn't visible as needed when sitting, the fact that they're pregnant is a valid reason to need a seat. \n\nThe elderly woman might have thought the woman she called over needed the seat more, maybe because she's older or because the author was sitting and the woman was standing. However, the author was already seated and had a legitimate need. The elderly woman's action could be seen as taking the seat for the other woman without considering the author's situation. \n\nThe author offered the seat to the other woman, which is a kind gesture. But the question is about whether they were in the wrong for being annoyed at the elderly woman. The key here is whether the author had the right to that seat. Since they were already there and the elderly woman didn't wait for the author to leave before offering the seat, that might be the issue. The author might feel that their need was as valid, if not more, than the other woman's, especially when the seat wasn't necessary for the other woman since she wasn't showing any discomfort. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they usually offer their seat to those in need, but in this case, they felt pressured by the elderly woman's suggestion. The elderly woman's action might have been abrupt and not considering the author's own needs. The author's annoyance is directed at the elderly woman for making them feel shamed into giving up the seat, not at the woman who took it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's reaction is understandable. They had a legitimate need, and the elderly woman's behavior might have been inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. The right to the seat wasn't given up by the author, and the elderly woman's intervention was perhaps unnecessary. The author's annoyance is justified because they were in a situation that required rest and were pressured into giving up their seat. So, the answer is B.\n"
