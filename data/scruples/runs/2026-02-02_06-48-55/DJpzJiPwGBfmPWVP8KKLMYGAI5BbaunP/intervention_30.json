I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a pregnant student who had to give up her seat at a bus station because an elderly woman shamed her into it. The author was initially sitting in a free seat at the bus station after a long commute. When another woman (not elderly) came, the elderly woman next to the author told her to take the seat, implying the author should give it up. The author, feeling embarrassed, gave up her seat even though her pregnancy wasn't visible while sitting but obvious when standing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rules of public seating. Generally, there's no law that says a pregnant person has the right to a seat over others. Priority seating is usually for the elderly, disabled, or those with obvious need. The author mentions that the elderly woman next to her was the one who called over the other woman. The other woman wasn't showing any distress, so maybe she didn't need the seat. The author's pregnancy, while a valid reason for needing a seat, isn't visible when sitting, so others might not be aware of her condition.\n\nThe author says she's not annoyed at the woman who took the seat, but at the one who made her give it up. The key issue here is whether the elderly woman had the right to pressure the author to give up her seat. Since the author was already seated and the seats were taken by others, maybe the elderly woman overstepped by not asking the other people first. However, the author did give up her seat without a fight, which could be seen as passive-aggressive. The author might feel wronged because she had a legitimate need, but if others were already seated, perhaps the elderly woman was just trying to help someone else. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's annoyance might be justified because her condition wasn't apparent when sitting, leading others to not realize she needed the seat. However, in public spaces, people often can't see others' needs unless it's obvious. If the author wanted a seat, maybe she should have communicated her need better by, for example, standing up to show her pregnancy. But she might not want to draw attention. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being annoyed because her need wasn't visible. However, she did give up the seat without confrontation, which she might regret. The elderly woman might have acted inconsiderately by not considering the author's hidden need. But the author's decision to give up the seat could be seen as a personal choice, not necessarily wrong. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
