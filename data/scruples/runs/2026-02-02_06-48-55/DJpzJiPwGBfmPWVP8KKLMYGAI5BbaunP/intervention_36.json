I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed after giving up their seat on a bus. The situation is that the author is a pregnant student with a long commute, and after sitting in the city's central bus station, an elderly woman tells her to give her seat to another woman who's there. The author complied but is now upset about it.\n\nFirst, the author's context is important. She's pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable or painful, and she's been on her feet for a long time. Her commute is exhausting, and she's physically tired. She mentions that the elderly woman shamed her into giving up the seat, and she's annoyed at that, not at the woman who took the seat.\n\nNow, the woman who took the seat wasn't showing any signs of needing it. The elderly woman, however, might have thought that the other woman needed the seat more, but there's no indication that the other woman was elderly or in a similar state. The author's pregnancy was obvious when standing, so maybe the elderly woman didn't notice until then.\n\nThe key points here are about social norms regarding giving up seats. Generally, people give up seats to those who need them more, like the elderly, disabled, or pregnant. However, in this case, the author was already seated and the other woman wasn't showing any signs of needing it. The elderly woman's action might have been based on a misjudgment, perhaps not realizing the author's condition until she stood up.\n\nThe author didn't confront the situation, just gave up the seat out of politeness but felt shamed. She's not annoyed at the woman who took the seat but at the one who told her to do it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed.\n\nFrom a social perspective, the elderly woman might have thought she was helping, but if she didn't consider the author's situation (pregnancy), she could be at fault. The author, in her state, might have been entitled to keep the seat. However, the author did give up the seat, which was polite, and the annoyance comes from being made to feel like she had to give it up. \n\nI need to consider if the author's reaction is justified. She's in a vulnerable position due to pregnancy and a tiring commute. The elderly woman's action might have been abrupt or insensitive, leading to the author's discomfort. The author's annoyance isn't at the other woman but the situation and the pressure from the elderly woman. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the elderly woman acted wrongly, then the author isn't in the wrong for being annoyed. But if the author should have stood regardless, then she might be in the right for giving up the seat but annoyed for the wrong reasons. However, the author's situation (pregnancy) is a valid reason to keep the seat, so the elderly woman might have been incorrect in her judgment.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being annoyed. The answer is B.\n"
