I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving up a seat on a bus stop.\n\nFirst, the author is a pregnant woman, 5 months along, which isn't visibly obvious when sitting. She took a seat after a long commute, which is understandable given her exhaustion. Then an elderly woman next to her told her to give the seat to another woman. The author did give up her seat, but is now annoyed about it.\n\nI need to consider the context. The author had been standing for a long time, is pregnant, and was sitting on a limited number of seats. The elderly woman asked her to give up the seat, but maybe she didn't need it as much as the author. The other woman wasn't showing discomfort, so maybe she didn't need the seat.\n\nThe author isn't upset with the woman who took the seat, but with the elderly woman who pressured her. The author also mentions she usually offers her seat to others, so she's not being selfish. She might feel that the elderly woman assumed she (author) wasn't pregnant and that the other woman needed the seat more. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for being annoyed? Well, she gave up the seat without confrontation. She didn't force the other woman; the elderly woman did. The author's annoyance is towards the elderly woman, not the one who took the seat. Maybe the elderly woman misjudged the situation. \n\nThe author's situation is valid\u2014pregnancy can make standing difficult even if not visible when seated. The elderly woman's action might have been based on incorrect assumptions. The author's reaction is understandable. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
