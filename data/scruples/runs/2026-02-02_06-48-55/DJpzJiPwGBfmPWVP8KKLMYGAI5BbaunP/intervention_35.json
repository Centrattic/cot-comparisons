I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after giving up their seat at a bus station. The situation involves a pregnant woman who was sitting when an elderly woman told her to give the seat to another woman who wasn't showing any signs of needing it.\n\nFirst, the author's context is important. She's commuting a long way, is pregnant (which can make standing uncomfortable), and was sitting in a waiting area. The seats were all free initially, but then filled up. The elderly woman next to her told her to give up her seat for another woman. The author did so, feeling embarrassed because her pregnancy wasn't visible when sitting, but obvious when standing.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author had a legitimate reason to be sitting\u2014pregnancy can cause fatigue and discomfort. The elderly woman might have thought the other woman needed the seat more, but the author was also in a vulnerable state. However, the author didn't have to give up the seat. Public seating is usually first-come, first-served unless someone is clearly in need (like elderly, disabled, etc.). The other woman wasn't showing signs of needing the seat, so the author might not have needed to give it up. But the author did it because she felt shamed, not necessarily because she owed the seat.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author was in the wrong. The author didn't force the other woman to take the seat. She was shamed by the elderly woman. The author's annoyance is directed at the elderly woman for making her feel that way. The author also mentions she's usually considerate and offers seats when needed, which suggests she's not being inconsiderate. So, maybe she's not in the wrong here. The elderly woman might be at fault for assuming the other woman needed the seat more without clear signs.\n\nBut some might argue that the author should have stood her ground. However, given her condition (pregnancy), standing could be harder. On the other hand, if the seat was already given to someone else first, maybe she should have let it be. But in this case, the author was there first. The elderly woman's intervention was perhaps inappropriate. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being annoyed. She had a right to sit, and the other woman wasn't obviously in need. Therefore, the answer might be B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
