I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after giving up their seat at the bus station. The situation involves the author being pregnant, tired from a long commute, and an elderly woman insisting that the author give up the seat to another woman.\n\nFirst, the author mentions being 5 months pregnant. Even if it's not visibly obvious when sitting, standing could be uncomfortable. Public transport policies often prioritize seating for those who need it, like pregnant individuals, elderly, or disabled. However, the author was sitting when approached, and the elderly woman told them to give up the seat. The author then stood up, and their pregnancy became more noticeable.\n\nThe key points here are intent and perception. The elderly woman's request was based on her judgment, possibly thinking the other woman needed the seat more. The author, however, felt shamed into moving. The author isn't upset with the woman who took the seat but with the one who pressured them. \n\nThe author also states they usually offer their seat if someone needs it more. But in this case, they might have felt that their own need (pregnancy, fatigue) was valid. However, they gave up the seat without confrontation. The question is whether giving up the seat was the wrong move or if they had the right to keep it.\n\nLegally or ethically, there's no law requiring someone to give up a seat unless there's a specific rule. Public transport seats are typically first-come, first-served. The elderly woman's insistence might have been overstepping, but the author didn't confront her. The author's annoyance is more about feeling shamed rather than the act of giving up the seat itself. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling that way. They were in a situation where someone else felt they should yield, but the author's choice to comply without conflict isn't wrong. The real issue is the elderly woman's behavior. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
