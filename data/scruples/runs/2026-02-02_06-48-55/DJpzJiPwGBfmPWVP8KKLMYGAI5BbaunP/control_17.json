I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting annoyed after giving up their seat to another woman, who was older but not elderly, while the author is pregnant and exhausted.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The author is pregnant, 5 months along, which isn't visible when sitting but becomes obvious when standing. They took a seat at the central bus station after a long commute. An elderly woman sat next to them, and then another woman who's a bit older but not elderly. The elderly woman gestured for the author to give up their seat to this other woman, which the author did, feeling embarrassed but not angry at the one who took the seat, just annoyed at the elderly woman's insistence.\n\nThe author is asking if they were wrong to be annoyed. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nThe elderly woman's action might be based on the idea that the other woman, though not elderly, might need the seat more. However, the author has valid reasons: being pregnant (which can involve physical discomfort and needing rest), a long and tiring commute, and being 5 months along where standing could be uncomfortable. The fact that their pregnancy wasn't obvious when seated might have led to others not recognizing their need for a seat. \n\nIn many places, there are laws or social norms about giving up seats for pregnant individuals. The elderly woman might not have known the author was pregnant. But the author's annoyance stems from feeling shamed into giving up the seat. They mention they usually offer seats to those in need, so they didn't resist because they thought they had the right to the seat, but because they felt it was unfair given their own circumstances.\n\nThe key points are: the author's right to sit due to pregnancy, the elderly woman's assumption, and the social norms around respecting pregnant people's needs. Since the author had a legitimate reason (pregnancy, fatigue), and the elderly woman's action was based on a misjudgment, the author isn't in the wrong. The annoyance is justified because they were treated as if they didn't deserve the seat when they had valid reasons to need it. Also, the author didn't act confrontationally but just gave in, which shows they tried to be polite. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
