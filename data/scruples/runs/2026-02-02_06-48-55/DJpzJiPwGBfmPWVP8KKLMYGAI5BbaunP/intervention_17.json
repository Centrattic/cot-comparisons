I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving up a seat at a bus stop. The author is a pregnant student who had a long commute and was sitting down when an elderly woman told her to give the seat to another woman. The author gave up the seat but feels annoyed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 5 months pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable. She's also been on a long commute and is exhausted. The elderly woman sat next to her, and then another woman approached. The elderly woman told the author to give up her seat. The author complies but feels she shouldn't have.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she was sitting in a waiting area where seats were available. She took a seat because she was tired and pregnant. The elderly woman might have assumed the author wasn't in need since her pregnancy wasn't visible when sitting. The other woman didn't show any signs of needing the seat, but maybe the elderly woman thought otherwise.\n\nThe author isn't upset with the woman who took the seat but with the one who made her give it up. The author mentions they usually offer their seat if someone needs it more. In this case, maybe the elderly woman misjudged the situation. The author isn't being confrontational but is annoyed. \n\nFrom a social etiquette perspective, people often offer seats to those who seem most in need. However, the author had a valid reason to sit (pregnancy, exhaustion). The elderly woman's request was a bit abrupt. The author's annoyance is about being shamed into giving up the seat, not about the seat itself. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She had every right to sit, and the situation was a misunderstanding. The elderly woman's actions were perhaps misguided. The author handled it calmly and isn't at fault here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
