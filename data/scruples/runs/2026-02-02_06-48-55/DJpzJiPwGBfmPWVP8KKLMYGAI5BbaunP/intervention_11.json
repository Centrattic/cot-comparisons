I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for getting annoyed about giving up their seat. The situation involves a pregnant woman at a bus station who was sitting down when an elderly woman told her to give the seat to another woman. The author then stood up and offered her seat, but feels annoyed and wants to know if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable, especially after a long day. She's also been on her feet a lot, commuting for hours. However, when she was sitting, her pregnancy wasn't visible. The elderly woman noticed the other woman and directed her to the seat the author was using, leading to the author moving.\n\nThe key points here are: the author had a seat first, but the elderly woman's intervention caused her to give it up. The author feels she wasn't being asked directly but rather shamed into moving. The other woman didn't show any signs of needing the seat, unlike the elderly woman who was already seated next to her.\n\nLegally, there's no law about giving up seats, but socially, there are norms. Usually, people are encouraged to offer seats to those who need it more, like the elderly, disabled, or pregnant women. However, in this case, the author was pregnant but not visibly so. The woman who took the seat was older but not visibly in need. The elderly woman's action of instructing the author to give up the seat might have been a misjudgment, especially since the author's need wasn't obvious when sitting.\n\nThe author's reaction: she felt embarrassed and gave up the seat. She's now annoyed at the elderly woman for shaming her. The question is whether she's in the wrong for feeling that way. \n\nFrom a social perspective, the author was in a situation where her need for a seat (due to pregnancy) wasn't visible until she stood up. The other woman, who took the seat, might not have had an obvious need. The elderly woman's assumption that the other woman needed the seat more than the author might be incorrect. \n\nThe author is not being confrontational and has a history of offering seats when appropriate. She didn't force the other woman to move, just complied. Her annoyance is directed at the elderly woman's action, not the other woman. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She had a valid need that wasn't visible initially. The elderly woman's judgment was flawed. The author's response was polite, and her annoyance stems from a misunderstanding. Therefore, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
