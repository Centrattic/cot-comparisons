I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. They want a simple A or B answer. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nSo, the person is a pregnant student commuting a long way, very tired from the day. She takes a seat at the bus station because she's exhausted. An elderly woman then tells a standing woman to take her seat. The author gives up their seat to avoid confrontation. The author feels annoyed because they were already sitting, but their pregnancy wasn't obvious until they stood up.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author was wrong. The key points are: the author was sitting in a seat they took first, became pregnant (which can be a valid reason to need a seat), and was asked to give it up by another person, not the one who was standing. \n\nIn many public transport settings, there are rules about giving seats to those in need, but usually, if someone is already seated and then someone more in need comes, they might be asked. However, the elderly woman here wasn't the one who was standing; she told the other woman to take the author's seat. The author was already sitting, and the standing woman wasn't showing signs of needing the seat. The author felt shamed into giving up the seat. \n\nThe author mentions they always offer seats to those who need them more, which suggests they didn't intend to keep it if someone needed it more. But the elderly woman's action was perhaps not appropriate, as she wasn't the one needing the seat. The author was already seated and justified in needing rest due to being pregnant and exhausted. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a valid reason to sit and were not being inconsiderate. The elderly woman's behavior was the issue here. The answer should be B, No.\n"
