I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a pregnant woman giving up her seat at a bus station to an older woman after being asked by another woman who wasn't elderly. The author is annoyed because she felt shamed into giving up her seat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is pregnant, which can make standing uncomfortable, especially after a long day of traveling. She's also exhausted from a long commute. The elderly woman next to her was given the seat by the other woman, and the author felt pressured to give up her seat even though the other woman wasn't elderly or in obvious distress.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations of public behavior. In many places, there's a cultural norm to offer seats to those who might need them more, like the elderly, pregnant women, or people with disabilities. However, the author was already sitting, and the other woman wasn't clearly showing any need for a seat. The elderly woman was already seated, so maybe the author thought that person needed it more, but the other woman was just standing and the author was the pregnant one.\n\nThe author mentions that her pregnancy wasn't visible when sitting but obvious when standing. So when she stood up, the other woman might not have realized she was pregnant. However, the author was the one who gave up the seat after being told to by the elderly woman. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being annoyed at being shamed into giving up her seat.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. She had a right to the seat she was sitting in, especially considering her condition. The elderly woman might have acted out of good intentions but didn't consider the author's situation. The author's annoyance is understandable because she felt her needs were overlooked. Since she was already pregnant and exhausted, it's reasonable for her to be upset about being asked to give up her seat without a clear reason. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
