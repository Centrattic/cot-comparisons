I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, who is pregnant and exhausted from a long commute, giving up her seat in a bus station to an older woman after being shamed by her. The key points here are the author's state of being pregnant, the fact that she had the seat first, and the other woman's actions.\n\nFirst, the author mentions she's 5 months pregnant, which can cause discomfort, especially after a long day. Her commute is extensive, involving multiple buses and walking, so she's tired. When she sits down, the elderly woman next to her then asks her to give the seat to another woman. The author complies but feels shamed and is now questioning if she was wrong to give up the seat.\n\nI need to consider societal norms around giving up seats. Typically, people are encouraged to offer seats to those who need it more, like the elderly or pregnant women. However, in this case, the author herself is pregnant and could be considered in a category that might deserve a seat. The other woman wasn't showing signs of discomfort, so maybe she didn't need the seat as much. The elderly woman's action of shaming the author into giving up the seat might have been unnecessary, especially if the author had the seat first and was also in need.\n\nThe author didn't force the seat away from anyone; she gave it up voluntarily because she felt pressured. It's possible the elderly woman misjudged the situation, seeing the author as not visibly pregnant when sitting. The author's decision to let the seat go might be seen as a kind gesture, but she's now upset because she felt shamed. The question is whether she's in the wrong for being annoyed. \n\nSince she gave up the seat without confrontation and it's a matter of personal discomfort rather than a public rule, it's more about personal feelings. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling that way. She's justified in her annoyance at being made to feel bad for sitting, especially when she was in a vulnerable state. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
