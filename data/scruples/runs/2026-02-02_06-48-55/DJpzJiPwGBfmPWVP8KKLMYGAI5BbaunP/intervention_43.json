I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a pregnant student with a long commute, sitting at the bus station. An elderly woman next to her tells a standing woman to take her seat. The author gives up the seat, feeling shamed. Now she's annoyed at the elderly woman for making her give up the seat, even though she's pregnant and tired.\n\nSo, the main question is: Was the author in the wrong for being annoyed? The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides.\n\nThe author's side: She's pregnant, had a long day, and was in a situation where she needed the seat for her own comfort. The elderly woman didn't ask for her seat but shamed her into giving it to another woman. The author is upset about that. She also mentions she's not annoyed at the woman who took the seat but the one who made her give it up.\n\nThe elderly woman's side: Maybe she thought the standing woman needed the seat more. But why single out the author? The author was already sitting, and the elderly woman could have just offered her own seat instead of making the author give hers up. The author's pregnancy wasn't visible when sitting, so the elderly woman might not have known.\n\nLegally, there's no rule that requires giving up a seat unless it's a designated priority seat. But morally, it's more gray. The author was there first, but the elderly woman might have thought the standing woman was in need. However, the author was pregnant and likely in need herself. The author's annoyance is about being shamed into giving up the seat.\n\nThe key points are: Did the elderly woman have the right to make the author give up her seat? The author isn't in the wrong for being annoyed because she was treated unfairly. She was pregnant, had a long commute, and was shamed. The elderly woman's actions were inappropriate. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
