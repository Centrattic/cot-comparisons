I use public transport to commute. I work part time at the weekend, and I\u2019m in University most weekdays. My commute to University consists of: A bus from my village to the closest city. Walking to said city\u2019s main bus station. Two hour bus ride to the city where the University is. Further half hour bus journey to University campus. Also, the University is huge, I feel like my feet are killing me by the end of the day, and there\u2019s a fair walk between each bus stop that I go to. I\u2019m also 5 months pregnant. \n\nSo, at the end of the day, when I got to the central bus station in the city where the University is, I\u2019m usually pretty exhausted. As it\u2019s a bus station, there are a couple of seats available for waiting for your bus to turn up. Thankfully, they were all free! I took one, and over the next 5 minutes all of the others were snapped up to: a mix of people took seats, but an elderly woman sat next to me. Soon after, a woman is standing a few feet away from me. She isn\u2019t showing any signs of discomfort, and seems to just be minding her own business. She\u2019s a little older, but I wouldn\u2019t have considered her elderly. Anyway, the elderly woman next to me calls over to the woman, gives me a pointed stare and says \u2018You can sit here\u2019 beckoning to where I was sitting. Honestly, I was really taken aback. I was embarrassed and just got up to offer the woman my seat which she took. \n\nMy pregnancy wasn\u2019t visible until I stood up. I just look fat when I\u2019m sitting down \ud83d\ude12 But it\u2019s very obvious when I\u2019m standing, many people ask me if I\u2019m having twins... lovely, but no, just one presumably huge baby. \n\nAnyway, I don\u2019t like confrontation so I just it go. Am I right to be annoyed or was I being an asshole? I\u2019m in no way annoyed at the woman who took my seat... more the woman who I felt shamed me into giving it up. Side note, I always offer my place to anyone I think who needs it more than I do. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t expect anyone to give up their seat for me if they were there first, pregnant or not pregnant. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I was just being hormonal, but AITA? Would be good to know in case this happens again. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a pregnant woman who gave up her seat at a bus station because an elderly woman told her to. She's annoyed at the elderly woman for making her feel shamed into giving up the seat, not the woman who took it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman has a long, tiring commute, is pregnant (which later becomes visible when she stands), and was sitting on a seat that was taken while she was there. The elderly woman told her to give the seat to another woman. The key points are: was the author wrong to give up the seat, and is she in the wrong for being annoyed?\n\nPublic transport etiquette often involves offering seats to those who need them more. However, in this case, the seat wasn't taken by the elderly woman first. The original poster was there first, and the elderly woman told her to give up the seat. The seat was free when she arrived, and others took the other seats over time. The woman standing wasn't showing signs of needing the seat, unlike the author who is pregnant and exhausted.\n\nThe author mentions she's 5 months pregnant, and when standing, it's obvious. If the elderly woman didn't realize the author was pregnant until she stood up, that might have been a factor. But the author says the seat wasn't taken when she arrived, so she had a right to it. The elderly woman's action might have been based on a misunderstanding or not seeing the pregnancy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she was there first and gave up the seat under social pressure, not because she was wrong to sit, the answer would likely be no. She wasn't in the wrong for sitting or for being annoyed at being shamed. The elderly woman's action was inappropriate, and the author isn't at fault for that. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
