It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online after helping to clean it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The main person was struggling with depression, leading to a really messy apartment. They felt ashamed enough that they didn't want anyone to see it except two close friends, who volunteered to help clean. After the cleaning, one of those friends (the 12-year friend) posted pictures of the mess online with jokes about how bad it was. The main person blocked that friend and stopped answering calls. Others say they're overreacting because the friend helped clean.\n\nSo, is the main person in the wrong? Well, the key points here are trust and privacy. The friends were entrusted with private information\u2014how the person was dealing with depression and their messy apartment. By posting the pictures, the friend violated that trust. Even if the intention was to make jokes, sharing someone's personal situation without consent is a breach of privacy. The main person's reaction is about feeling their privacy was invaded and their emotional state disrespected. \n\nThe friend's defense is that they helped clean, but that doesn't give them the right to share private images. People might argue that they have free speech, but in a close friendship, there's an expectation of discretion. The main person had the right to be upset about this violation. Ending the friendship could be a reaction to losing trust, which is a common response when someone betrays confidence. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't realize how bad the situation was, but the main person had already expressed their discomfort. So the friend should have known better. The other friends saying it's overreaction might not understand the context of the depression and the shame involved. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the main person isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship. The friend who posted the pictures is the one who breached trust. The main person's emotional state and privacy are valid concerns. So the answer should be B, No.\n"
