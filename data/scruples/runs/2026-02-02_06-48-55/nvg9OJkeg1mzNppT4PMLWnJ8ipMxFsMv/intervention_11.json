It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. The user's apartment was a mess due to depression, and even though friends helped clean, one of them posted the pictures with jokes. The user blocked that friend and is now avoiding calls, and some others say it's an overreaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user was in a vulnerable state with depression, which made the apartment situation worse. They trusted two friends to help, and the friend who posted the pictures was one of them. The key point here is consent and respect for privacy. The user didn't agree to have their home's state shared publicly, especially with jokes that could be mocking.\n\nEven though the friend helped clean, that doesn't give them the right to post the photos without permission. The user's feelings of embarrassment and shame are valid, especially given their mental health struggles. The act of sharing private, potentially sensitive information without consent can be seen as a breach of trust, regardless of the friend's intentions.\n\nThe friends who called it an overreaction might be focusing on the friend's helpful action (cleaning) and not the violation of privacy. But the user's trust was that the mess was a private matter. Posting it online, even with humor, could be hurtful and disregards the user's feelings. \n\nSo, the user's reaction\u2014blocking and cutting off communication\u2014is a response to a breach of trust and privacy. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether the friend's action was justified. Since sharing private photos without permission is generally wrong, the user isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No)."
