      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend of 12 years posted pictures of their messy apartment online, which the person was already struggling with due to depression. The friend had helped clean the apartment after they admitted the problem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person was dealing with depression, which is a serious mental health issue. Their apartment was in a bad state, and they felt ashamed. They told two friends, including the 12-year friend, who helped clean. But then the 12-year friend posted pictures and jokes about the mess online. The person blocked them and stopped taking their calls. Others are saying it's an overreaction because the friend helped clean.\n\nSo, the core issue is about privacy and trust. The person might have expected that the friend, who was helping them during a vulnerable time, would respect their privacy. Sharing the pictures without permission could be seen as violating that trust. Even if the friend helped, sharing the situation publicly could be hurtful, especially when the person was already feeling ashamed.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have thought it was a joke or meant to be light-hearted, but that doesn't excuse the breach of privacy. The person's reaction to block and end the friendship could be justified if they felt disrespected or violated. Others might think it's an overreaction, but the emotional impact of having a private, sensitive moment shared publicly could be significant, especially with a mental health struggle involved.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether sharing the pictures was a breach of trust and if the author's reaction is reasonable. Since the friend knew the person was upset about the situation and then publicized it, the author's actions are likely justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
