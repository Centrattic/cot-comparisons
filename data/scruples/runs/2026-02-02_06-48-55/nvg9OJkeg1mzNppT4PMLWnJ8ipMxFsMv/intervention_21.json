It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was dealing with depression, leading to a very messy apartment. Two friends, one a 10-year friend and another a 12-year friend, helped clean. The 12-year friend later posted pictures of the apartment in a Facebook group with jokes about how gross it was. The author blocked them and stopped answering calls. Some friends say the author is overreacting because the friend helped clean. The author feels violated because they were already upset about the friends seeing the mess.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether sharing those pictures was a breach of trust, especially considering the author's mental health. The friend helped clean, but the act of posting the pictures without consent could be seen as insensitive. The author had admitted their mess and the emotional state, so the friend's actions might have crossed a line, even if they were trying to help.\n\nNow, considering the user's own thought that the author might be in the wrong, I need to challenge that. The user might think that since the friend helped, they had the right to post the pictures. But the key here is the context of the author's vulnerability. The friend knew about the depression and the shame the author felt. Sharing that in public, even as a joke, could be hurtful and not respecting the author's privacy and emotional state.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't realize the severity of the situation. However, the author had already expressed their discomfort about the friends seeing the mess. The act of posting it publicly shows a lack of consideration. So, the friend is at fault here, and the author's reaction might be justified as protecting their privacy and mental well-being.\n\nThe friends who say the author is overreacting might not grasp the emotional impact. The author had a right to privacy, and the friend's actions were a breach of that trust. Even if the friend meant no harm, the consequences were hurtful. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship after such a breach.\n"
