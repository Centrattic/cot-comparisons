I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online after helping clean it up. The key points here are privacy, trust, and the context of the person's mental health.\n\nFirst, the person was dealing with depression, leading to a very messy apartment. They were already embarrassed and had to admit their situation to two close friends. Those friends helped clean, which was stressful for the person. Then, one of the friends (the 12-year friend) posted pictures of the apartment online with jokes about it. \n\nThe person blocked the friend and stopped answering their calls. Other friends say they're overreacting because the friend helped clean. But the person felt their privacy was violated. They trusted the friend enough to let them into their home during a vulnerable time. Sharing those images without permission, especially with mockery, could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the friend helped, the act of posting the pictures without consent is problematic. \n\nMental health context is crucial here. The person was already in a sensitive state, and the friend's actions might have added to their distress. The justification of \"he helped clean\" doesn't override the privacy issue. The right to control who sees one's personal space is important. The person ending the friendship because of this breach isn't necessarily wrong, especially if they felt disrespected. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They had a right to their privacy and felt betrayed by the friend's actions despite the help. The friend's behavior was disrespectful, regardless of the prior assistance.\n"
