It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship after their friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend helping them clean, then sharing those photos with jokes about the mess. The main issue here is privacy and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the person was dealing with depression, which makes their living conditions worse. They were already embarrassed and hadn't shared this with others except for two close friends. Those friends offered to help, so the person allowed them into their home. That implies a level of trust and vulnerability. \n\nThen, the friend of 12 years posted the pictures without permission, even though the cleaning was a private, personal help session. The other friends are saying it's okay because they helped clean, but the key point is that the person didn't consent to the photos being shared publicly. \n\nEven if the friend's intention was to make light-hearted jokes, sharing private, sensitive content without permission is a breach of trust. The person was already in a vulnerable state, and the friend's actions could exacerbate their feelings of shame. \n\nThe question is whether ending the friendship is justified. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. But considering the violation of privacy and the emotional state of the person, it seems the friend crossed a line. The author's reaction, while strong, is a response to a breach of trust. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
