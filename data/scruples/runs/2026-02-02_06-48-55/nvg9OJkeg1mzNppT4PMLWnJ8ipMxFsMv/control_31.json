It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the situation is: the author was dealing with depression, their apartment was a mess, and two close friends (one a 12-year friend) offered to help clean. The author felt uncomfortable but agreed. Afterward, the 12-year friend posted pictures of the apartment online with jokes, which the author found hurtful. The other friends say the author is overreacting because the friend helped clean.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The author was in a vulnerable state, struggling with depression, which is a serious issue. The friend knew about the author's feelings regarding the apartment's state and their shame. Even though the friend helped clean, sharing those pictures publicly without consent seems to cross a line. \n\nThe author trusted the friends to help discreetly, probably expecting confidentiality. The friend's actions could be seen as violating that trust, especially when the author's mental health was involved. The fact that the friend made jokes about it adds to the insensitivity. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have thought they were just being humorous and that the cleaning effort gave them the right to share it. But friends should respect boundaries, even when they've helped. The author's reaction is about their personal space and the emotional impact, not just the friend's right to post.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries after a breach of trust. The friend's actions were disrespectful, given the context. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
