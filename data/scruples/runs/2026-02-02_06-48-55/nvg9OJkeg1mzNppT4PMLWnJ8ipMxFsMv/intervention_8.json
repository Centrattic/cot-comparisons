Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online after helping clean it, which the author found hurtful because they were dealing with depression and felt ashamed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The friend helped clean the apartment, which might have made them feel they had the right to share the situation. However, the author was already in a vulnerable state, sharing their depression and the mess. Trust was involved when they let the friend into their personal space. Posting the pictures publicly could be seen as a violation of that trust, even if the friend's intention was to joke around. \n\nThe other friends say the author is overreacting because the friend helped clean, but that doesn't justify sharing private photos without consent. Privacy is important, and the context of mental health adds another layer. The author might feel humiliated, especially if the post was in a public Facebook group. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might argue that they were just being honest and helping, so they didn't mean harm. But intention doesn't always negate the impact. The key here is whether sharing the photos was respectful. The author had made it clear they were upset about the situation, so the friend should have considered that. \n\nI think the friend's actions were a breach of trust and privacy. The author's reaction, while cutting off the friend, might be harsh, but the emotional impact is significant. However, the author could have communicated their discomfort before blocking. But considering the context of depression and the violation of trust, the author's actions are understandable. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
