It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending a friendship because a close friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. The friend had helped clean up after the author was struggling with depression. The author is upset because the friend shared those images in a Facebook group, making jokes about it. The other friends are saying the author is overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author was dealing with depression, which might have made the situation more sensitive. The friend volunteered to help, which is good, but then shared the photos without permission. The author felt ashamed and the friend's post was mocking. The main issue is the breach of trust and privacy. The friend knew how the author felt about their apartment's condition, so sharing that information publicly could be a violation of trust.\n\nThe author blocked the friend on Facebook and stopped taking calls. Other friends think it's over the top because they helped clean. But the friend's action wasn't just sharing a photo; it was sharing in a way that made fun of the situation. The friend's intent matters here\u2014if they were trying to support and then later mocked the situation, that's a problem. The author's reaction is about protecting their privacy and emotional well-being, which is important, especially when dealing with depression.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the friend probably crossed a line by sharing private information without consent. The author had the right to expect that the photos wouldn't be shared, especially given the sensitive context. The friends who say it's overreacting might not be considering the author's mental health and the breach of trust. So the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship over this. The friend's actions were disrespectful and hurtful, so the author's response is justified. Answer B.\n"
