It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online, which the user was embarrassed about. The friend had helped clean, but then shared the images with jokes, leading to the user cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. The user was struggling with depression and had a messy apartment. They allowed two close friends to help clean, but those friends were aware of the user's sensitive state. The friend who posted the pictures was one of the older friends (12 years). The user felt ashamed and didn't want others to see their situation. Posting pictures without permission, especially when the person is in a vulnerable state, seems like a privacy violation.\n\nThe other friends are saying it's not a big deal because he helped clean. But the key point is consent. The user didn't agree to the photos being shared. Even if the friend was trying to make a joke, sharing private images without permission can be hurtful. The user's reaction is about protecting their privacy and mental health. Ending the friendship might be a strong response, but given the context of depression and the breach of trust, it might be justified.\n\nThe friend's actions could be seen as thoughtless. They knew how sensitive the user was about the situation. Using the photos for humor in a public group could exacerbate the user's depression. The user's decision to block and distance themselves is a way to set boundaries after a breach of trust. So, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
