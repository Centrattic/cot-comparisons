It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who posted the question is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they had a friend of 12 years who helped clean their messy apartment, which was a result of their depression. After the cleaning, the friend posted pictures of the apartment online with jokes about how gross it was. The person in question blocked them and stopped taking their calls. Now, others are saying they're overreacting, but they're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. The friend posted pictures of the person's apartment without their permission. Even if they helped clean it, that doesn't give them the right to share private spaces publicly. The person was already embarrassed about their situation, and sharing it without consent could be a violation of trust.\n\nThen there's the context of the friendship. The person was struggling with depression and had to admit their apartment was a mess. The friend volunteered to help, which is kind, but then shared the situation in a public group with jokes. That might have been insensitive, especially knowing how the person felt about it. The friend's actions could have been hurtful and damaging to their mental health.\n\nAlso, the fact that the person was dealing with depression adds another layer. Their emotional state was fragile, and the friend's actions could have exacerbated their feelings of shame and isolation. The other friends saying it's okay because he helped might be missing the point. The privacy and emotional impact are key here.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't realize it was a big deal. But given that the person had already expressed being upset about the situation, the friend should have known better. The act of sharing without permission, regardless of the intent, breaches trust. So the person ending the friendship might be justified in feeling that their boundaries were crossed.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the person who posted the question isn't in the wrong. The friend violated their privacy and the trust built during a vulnerable time. The answer should be B.\n"
