It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original post is in the wrong for ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was dealing with depression, their apartment was really messy, and two friends, including one with a 12-year friendship, helped clean. But then the 12-year friend posted pictures of the messy apartment on Facebook with jokes, which the author found hurtful. The author blocked the friend and is now avoiding calls. Others are saying the author is overreacting because the friend helped clean.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nI need to evaluate both sides. The author had a vulnerable situation, was open about their depression, and trusted friends to help. Sharing those photos without consent is a privacy issue. Even if the friend helped clean, posting it online could be seen as insensitive, especially knowing the author was ashamed. The friend might have thought it was a joke, but the author felt disrespected. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might argue they were just sharing their experience and maybe saw it as a way to highlight they helped. But the key point is whether the friend respected the author's privacy and feelings. The author had to admit the mess to their friends, which was hard, and the friend then publicized it. That seems like a betrayal of trust. \n\nThe author's reaction is to end the friendship, which is a strong step. But given the context of mental health and privacy violation, maybe it's justified. The other friends say they're overreacting, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is in the wrong. Privacy and respect for someone's vulnerability are important. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (author not in the wrong). The friend violated privacy by sharing without permission, especially when the author was already in a sensitive state. The author has every right to be upset and take that action.\n"
