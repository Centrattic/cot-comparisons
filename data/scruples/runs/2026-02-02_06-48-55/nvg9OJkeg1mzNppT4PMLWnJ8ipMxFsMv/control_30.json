It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online after helping clean it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The person had depression, their apartment was a mess, they felt ashamed. Two friends (one 10 years, one 12 years) helped them clean. Then, the 12-year friend posted pictures in a Facebook group with jokes about how gross it was. The person blocked them and is ignoring calls. Others say it's an overreaction because the friend helped clean.\n\nSo, the main issue is privacy and respect. The person was already in a vulnerable state, struggling with depression, and the friend shared those private moments publicly, making jokes. Even though the friend helped, that doesn't give them the right to share without consent. The person might have trusted the friend enough to help, but that trust was broken by the post. The other friends think it's not a big deal, but the person felt violated.\n\nI need to consider if sharing the pictures was a breach of trust. The friend knew the situation was sensitive. Even if it's a public group, sharing private, sensitive information without permission can be hurtful. The person had the right to privacy in their home, especially during a tough time. The friend's actions undermined the trust and support they were supposed to provide.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't realize the impact. But knowing the person was ashamed, it was still a bad move. The person's reaction is about protecting their dignity and mental health. Ending the friendship is a personal choice, but the root of the problem is the violation of trust. The friend's defense that they helped clean doesn't justify the post. So, the person ending the friendship is justified. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
