It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online after helping them clean. The author ended the friendship because of this, and others are saying they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was dealing with depression, which led to their apartment being in a bad state. Two friends, including one of 12 years, offered to help clean. The author felt embarrassed about the situation and didn't want others to see. However, the 12-year friend posted pictures on Facebook, making jokes about the mess. The author blocked them and stopped taking calls, leading others to say they're overreacting.\n\nNow, considering privacy. The author didn't give permission for the friend to share pictures. Even if the friend helped clean, sharing someone's private, personal space without consent is a breach of privacy. Especially when the author was already vulnerable and embarrassed. The friend's action could be seen as violating trust. The fact that others say they're overreacting might indicate societal norms about sharing such content, but the key point is consent. \n\nThe friend's intention matters too. If they were making jokes at the author's expense, that's unkind. But if they were just sharing a story and didn't realize the impact, maybe. However, the author explicitly mentioned that they were upset about having the two friends see it. The 12-year friend should have been more considerate, knowing how sensitive the author was.\n\nSo, the author's reaction is about protecting their privacy and emotional well-being. Ending the friendship is a strong step, but given the violation of trust, it's understandable. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend shared without consent, the author isn't in the wrong. Others might argue that the friend has the right to post, but the author's feelings and the breach of trust are important. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the friend crossed a privacy boundary without consent, and the author's reaction is a valid response to that violation.\n"
