It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online after helping to clean it. The key points here are trust, privacy, and empathy.\n\nFirst, the person was dealing with depression and their apartment was in a bad state. They felt ashamed and only allowed two close friends to help clean. This shows a level of trust, as they were vulnerable. The friend who posted the pictures was one of the two who helped, so he knew how sensitive the situation was for the person. \n\nBy sharing those photos in a public Facebook group with jokes, the friend breached that trust. It's important to consider that the person was already struggling, and the friend's actions could have caused further emotional distress. Even though some friends think it's not a big deal because he helped clean, the context of the person's mental health makes the friend's actions more hurtful.\n\nThe author blocked the friend and stopped taking calls, which is a reasonable reaction to feeling disrespected and humiliated. The friends who think it's a minor issue might not fully grasp the impact on someone with depression. So, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship after a breach of trust and empathy. The answer should be B.\n"
