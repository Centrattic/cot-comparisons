It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend posting pictures of the author's messy apartment online, which led to the author ending the friendship. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they were dealing with depression, and their apartment was in a really bad state. They felt ashamed and had two close friends help clean. The friend in question, who's been a friend for 12 years, posted pictures of the apartment in a Facebook group with jokes about how gross it was. The author blocked them and stopped answering calls.\n\nNow, the other friends say the author is overreacting because the friend helped clean and can post whatever he wants. But the author felt the friend violated their trust and privacy. \n\nSo, the key points here are trust and privacy. The author was vulnerable, sharing a personal struggle, and allowed friends into their home to help. The friend then shared private, sensitive photos without consent. Even if the intention was to make jokes, sharing someone's private space without permission, especially when they're struggling, can be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nThe author's reaction is about feeling disrespected and exposed. The friend's action might have been unkind, even if it was meant as a joke. The fact that the author was already in a vulnerable state makes the situation more severe. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend did help, which might be where the argument that they can post it comes from. But that doesn't necessarily justify sharing the photos without consent. Privacy is a big deal, and when someone shares your personal, sensitive information without permission, it's a valid reason for feeling wronged. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship. The friend's actions were a violation, and the author had the right to set boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
