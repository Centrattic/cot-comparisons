It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend posting pictures of the author's messy apartment online, which the author found hurtful, especially since they were dealing with depression. The author ended the friendship, and others think they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a friend (12 years) who posted photos of their apartment after helping clean. The author felt ashamed and was dealing with depression. The friend made jokes about the mess, and the author ended the friendship, leading others to say they're overreacting.\n\nThe main issue here is privacy and respect. The friend, despite helping, shared private information without consent. The author was vulnerable, and the friend's actions could be seen as violating trust. Even though the friend helped, sharing the images publicly might have crossed a line. The author had a right to privacy and might feel that the friend's actions were mocking their personal struggles.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have thought they were being light-hearted and that they had permission since they helped clean. But the author didn't consent to the photos being posted. The friend's actions could be considered insensitive, especially given the author's mental health issues.\n\nThe question is whether the author overreacted. Ending a 12-year friendship is a big step, but if the friend violated trust and privacy, it's understandable. Others might think the friend was just having fun and didn't mean harm, but the author's feelings are valid. The answer would depend on whether sharing the photos without consent is inappropriate, which it generally is. So the author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
