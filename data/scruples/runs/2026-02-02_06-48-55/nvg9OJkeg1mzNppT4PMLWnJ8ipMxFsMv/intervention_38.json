It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend posting pictures of the author's messy apartment online, which the author found upsetting due to their depression. The friend in question had helped clean, but then shared the pictures with jokes, leading the author to cut off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a serious mental health issue, which makes the situation more sensitive. They were already ashamed of their living conditions and had to invite friends over to clean. The friend who posted the pictures did so after helping, but the author felt this was a violation of their privacy and trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have thought they were just sharing a funny story or being honest about the situation. They might not have realized how sensitive the author was feeling. However, the fact that the author had admitted their depression and the state of their apartment to close friends suggests that there was an expectation of privacy and support.\n\nThe friends who called the author overreacting might not fully grasp the emotional impact. The key points here are privacy, trust, and respect for someone in a vulnerable state. The author's decision to end the friendship is a response to feeling betrayed, which is valid if the friend disregarded their feelings. \n\nBut was the author wrong? They did block the friend and cut off contact. While the friend's action was inappropriate, the author's reaction might be seen as extreme. However, given the context of mental health and the breach of trust, the author's actions could be justified as self-preservation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the friend's actions were indeed a violation of trust and the author had a right to privacy, then no, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries, especially when dealing with personal issues. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
