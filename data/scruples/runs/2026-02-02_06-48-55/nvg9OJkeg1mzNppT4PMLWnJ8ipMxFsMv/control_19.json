It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a friend posting pictures of their apartment online after helping clean it up. The person was dealing with depression, their apartment was a mess, and two friends helped clean. Then one of them, a 12-year friend, posted pictures online with jokes about how gross it was. The writer blocked them and stopped taking their calls. Others say they're overreacting because the friend helped clean.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer was in a vulnerable state\u2014dealing with depression. Their privacy might have been a big concern. They shared their situation with friends, who offered to help. Even though they were stressed, they allowed the friends to come over. Now, the friend posted the pictures without permission. \n\nThe key points here are privacy and empathy. The friend knew how bad the situation was and that the writer was ashamed. Even if the friend made jokes, posting those pictures publicly could be seen as violating trust. The writer felt hurt and betrayed, leading them to end the friendship. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have thought they were being humorous or that since they helped clean, it was okay to share. However, the writer didn't give consent for the pictures to be shared. In such cases, respecting someone's privacy is usually expected, especially when they're in a sensitive situation. \n\nThe other friends say they're overreacting, but that's dismissing the writer's feelings. The fact that the friend knew about the depression and the writer's embarrassment makes the action more hurtful. The writer had a right to expect confidentiality, especially since they were sharing personal struggles. \n\nSo, the friend's action was a breach of privacy and trust. The writer isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship because they were protecting their boundaries and feelings. The friend's actions were hurtful regardless of the intention to clean. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
