It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong after ending a friendship because their friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. The situation involves depression, a really bad living situation, and a friend who helped clean but then shared the photos with jokes.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was dealing with serious depression, their apartment was in a disgusting state, and they only let two close friends in after admitting their struggles. Those friends helped clean, which is a big deal because it required trust. Then the friend of 12 years posted the before pictures in a Facebook group with jokes. The key here is that the friend knew how upset the person was about the situation. \n\nThe author blocked the friend and avoided calls, and others are saying it's overreacting. But the main issue is privacy and trust. The friend violated that trust by sharing private, sensitive information without permission. Even though he helped clean, that doesn't give him the right to expose someone's personal struggles, especially when they were vulnerable.\n\nDepression can make someone feel exposed and ashamed. The act of posting those pictures could be seen as cruel and insensitive, adding insult to injury. The friends had volunteered to help because they cared, but sharing the photos crossed a line. The author's reaction is about protecting their dignity and mental health. \n\nThe other friends argue that he can post whatever he wants, but the context of the situation (knowing the person's vulnerability) makes the action more hurtful. It's not just about the act of posting; it's about the betrayal of trust and the lack of consideration for the friend's emotional state. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a right to feel that their privacy was violated, especially given their mental health struggles. The friend's actions were inappropriate, and cutting off contact is a reasonable response to protect their well-being.\n"
