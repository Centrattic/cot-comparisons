It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. The situation is that the writer had depression, their apartment was really messy, friends helped clean, and then one friend posted pictures and jokes about it on Facebook. The writer blocked them and is now getting told they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The writer was in a vulnerable state, dealing with depression, and the friend helped them. But then the friend shared the situation publicly, which the writer found hurtful. The friend might argue that they were just being honest and maybe trying to show their help, but the writer felt shamed. \n\nBoundaries are important here. The writer probably didn't want the situation to be shared, especially with jokes, because it was a sensitive time. The friend might not have realized the impact of their actions. However, the friend did help, which is positive. But sharing private, vulnerable moments without consent is a breach of trust. \n\nThe friends who say the writer is overreacting might not understand the emotional weight of the situation. The writer had admitted their struggles to close friends, which required trust. The friend posting the pictures could have made the writer feel embarrassed or betrayed. \n\nIs the writer in the wrong for cutting off the friendship? Maybe not. They have the right to set boundaries and take action if someone violates them. The friend's action was a privacy issue. However, the writer's response is cutting off contact, which is a big step. But given the context of mental health and trust, it might be justified. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The writer's feelings are valid, and the friend crossed a boundary. The writer isn't wrong for protecting their privacy and ending the friendship in response to the breach of trust.\n"
