It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. The situation involves depression, a messy home, and a friend sharing those images with jokes.\n\nFirst, the author had a serious mental health issue, which is a significant factor. They were already ashamed and stressed about their living conditions. Friends came to help, which was a kind gesture, but then one friend posted the pictures without permission. The key here is consent. The author didn't agree to have their private space shared publicly. Even though the friend helped clean, that doesn't give them the right to post embarrassing content without permission.\n\nThe friend's action could be seen as violating privacy and trust. The author might feel humiliated, especially since they had confided in them about their struggles. The fact that other friends are downplaying it by saying \"he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean\" is dismissive. Helping clean doesn't equate to permission to share images. The author's reaction is about protecting their dignity and mental health, which is crucial.\n\nHowever, the author blocked the friend and refused calls, which might be seen as cutting off communication abruptly. But given the context of their mental health and the violation of trust, their response could be justified as self-preservation. The friend's actions were inconsiderate, especially knowing the author's feelings about the situation. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The answer is B.\n"
