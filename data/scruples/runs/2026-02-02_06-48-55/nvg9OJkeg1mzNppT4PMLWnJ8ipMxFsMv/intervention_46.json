It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online, which the person found offensive, especially since they were dealing with depression and the friend knew how bad it was.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's actions. They volunteered to help clean, which shows they wanted to support the person during a tough time. However, after the cleanup, the friend posted photos and jokes about the mess in a Facebook group. The key here is whether sharing those photos was a breach of trust or privacy. The person was already vulnerable, and the friend knew how upset they were about the situation. Sharing the pictures could be seen as embarrassing and violating that trust, even if the friend helped clean.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might argue that since they helped clean, it's not a big deal to share the photos. But that doesn't justify sharing private moments without consent. The author blocked the friend and stopped answering calls, which the other friends say is overreacting. But the author's reaction is based on their emotional state and the violation of privacy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the friend posted without consent, the author has a right to feel hurt and take action. The friend's justification (\"he helped clean\") doesn't excuse sharing private content without permission. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship over this breach of trust.\n"
