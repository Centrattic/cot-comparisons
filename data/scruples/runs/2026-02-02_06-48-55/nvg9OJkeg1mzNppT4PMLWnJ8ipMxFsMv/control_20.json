It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online after helping them clean. The person was dealing with depression and their apartment was a mess. Two friends helped clean, and then one of them, a 12-year friend, posted the pictures with jokes in a Facebook group. The person is now blocking them and refusing calls. Others say they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The person was in a vulnerable state due to depression, which might affect their privacy expectations. They were ashamed about their apartment's condition and were upset that their friend shared those images. Even though the friend helped clean, sharing the pictures could be seen as violating trust and privacy. The person felt it was a betrayal, especially since they were already embarrassed about their situation. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the friend had a right to share that content since they were involved in the cleaning. However, the context of the person's mental health and their explicit discomfort about their friends seeing the mess is important. The friend's action could be seen as insensitive, not considering the emotional impact. \n\nTrust is a big factor here. The person might feel that their privacy was respected when their friends helped them, but the friend then breached that trust by publicizing it. The fact that others are saying they're overreacting might not take into account the emotional state and the breach of confidentiality. \n\nSo, considering the context of mental health, the violation of privacy, and the breach of trust, the person ending the friendship might be justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
