It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person was dealing with depression, their apartment was really messy, and two friends helped clean. Then one of those friends (the 12-year friend) posted pictures of the apartment in a Facebook group with jokes about how gross it was. The author ended the friendship, but others say they're overreacting because the friend helped clean. The author is unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether sharing those pictures was a betrayal of trust. The author was already vulnerable, and the friend made a joke about their situation. Even though the friend helped clean, sharing private, embarrassing moments without consent could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nHowever, maybe the friend thought they were being humorous and didn't realize how hurtful it was. But the author felt ashamed and stressed about others seeing their situation. There's a balance between privacy and friendship norms. Posting someone's home without permission, especially when they're going through a tough time, might be considered inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author blocked the friend after seeing the post. Did they communicate their feelings first? If they directly told the friend it was hurtful, maybe the friend would have apologized. But if they just ended the friendship without addressing it, that could be seen as overreacting. But in this case, the author mentions refusing calls, which suggests some communication happened. \n\nThe other friends say the author is overreacting because the friend helped clean. But the context is important. The author was in a vulnerable state, and the friend shared that information publicly. Even if the friend felt justified in helping, sharing the pictures without consent might have violated the trust. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's reaction is understandable. They were already dealing with depression and shame, and the friend's action exacerbated that. The friend should have respected their privacy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship.\n"
