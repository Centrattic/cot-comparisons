It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online, which the person was already ashamed about due to depression. The friend had helped clean up, but then posted jokes and pictures of the mess in a Facebook group. The other friends say the person is overreacting, but the person feels violated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. When someone shares a personal space like an apartment, especially when they're vulnerable, there's an expectation of confidentiality. The friend helped clean up, which implies trust. Posting pictures without permission breaches that trust, even if the content is embarrassing. The person had depression and was already struggling, so the friend's action could add to their emotional distress.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. Did the friend ask if it was okay to post the pictures? If not, that's a problem. Even if the friend was joking, sharing someone's private situation without their consent is a violation. The other friends' opinion that it's okay because they helped clean doesn't justify the action. Helping out doesn't grant the right to share private information publicly.\n\nAlso, the impact on the person is significant. They were dealing with depression, which makes them more sensitive about their living conditions. The public shaming through social media could exacerbate their mental health issues. Ending the friendship is a strong step, but if the breach of trust was severe and there's no remorse from the friend, it might be justified.\n\nHowever, maybe the friend didn't realize the severity of the situation. But the person had already expressed being ashamed, so the friend should have known better. The key points are trust violation and lack of consent. The person ending the friendship isn't necessarily in the wrong because they valued their privacy and mental health. The friend's actions crossed a boundary, so the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
