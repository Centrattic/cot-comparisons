It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online after helping them clean it. The writer is struggling with depression and the state of their apartment, which they found so bad they were ashamed. They confided in two friends, who helped clean. One of these friends, a 12-year friend, later posted pictures of the apartment on Facebook with jokes about how gross it was. The writer blocked him and stopped taking his calls. Other friends say the writer is overreacting, but the author feels violated.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break down the key points. The main issue is the friend sharing private information without consent. The author had a mental health issue and was in a vulnerable state. They trusted their friends to help, but the act of posting pictures could be seen as a breach of trust. The friend's action could have been hurtful, especially considering the context of the author's depression and shame. \n\nHowever, the friend did help clean the apartment. Maybe they thought sharing the pictures was a joke or a way to highlight their help. But regardless of the intent, sharing someone's private space without permission is generally considered a privacy violation. The author had a right to expect that their situation, which they shared confidentially, wouldn't be made public. \n\nThe other friends say the author is overreacting, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. The key here is consent and trust. The friend's action could have been insensitive, especially given the context of the author's mental health. The author's reaction is about protecting their privacy and emotional well-being. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's action was a breach of trust, and the author has the right to set boundaries. Answer B.\n"
