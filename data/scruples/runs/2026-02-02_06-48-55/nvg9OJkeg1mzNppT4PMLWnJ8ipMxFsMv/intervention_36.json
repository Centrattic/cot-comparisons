It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for ending a friendship after their friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. The situation involves depression, a really bad state of the apartment, and friends helping clean. The key point is that one friend (12 years) posted the pictures with jokes, which made the author cut ties.\n\nFirst, the author had a serious issue with depression and a messy apartment, which they were ashamed of. They told two friends, including the 12-year friend, who helped clean. The author was already in a vulnerable state. The friend then posted pictures publicly, making jokes about it. The author blocked them and stopped answering calls. Others are saying the author is overreacting because the friend helped clean.\n\nNow, does the author have a right to be upset? The friend knew the author was embarrassed and had a mental health issue. Posting the pictures could be seen as violating privacy and not respecting the author's feelings. Even though the friend helped, the act of sharing personal, sensitive information without consent is a breach of trust. The author's reaction might be justified as they were already struggling, and the post could have added to their distress.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend thought they were being helpful or just making light of a situation. However, the context of the author's mental health and their explicit shame about the situation makes the friend's action more problematic. The friend should have considered the author's feelings and privacy. Sharing such content without permission, especially when the person is vulnerable, is generally not acceptable.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. They had the right to feel disrespected and to set boundaries. The friend's action was the issue. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
