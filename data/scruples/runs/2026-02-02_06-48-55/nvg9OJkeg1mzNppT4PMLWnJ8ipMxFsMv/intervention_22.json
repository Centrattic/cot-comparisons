It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. So, the situation is that a friend helped clean their apartment and then posted pictures online, making jokes about how gross it was. The person felt it was a breach of trust and ended the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was dealing with depression and their apartment was a mess. They were already in a vulnerable state. The friend who helped cleaning also knew how upset they were about having others see the apartment. The friend then shared pictures in a Facebook group, which the person found disrespectful and hurtful. \n\nNow, the key points here are trust and privacy. The friend had been trusted with a sensitive situation. Even though the friend helped, sharing those pictures without permission could be seen as a violation of that trust. The person might have felt embarrassed or humiliated, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the friend was just being honest and that they have the right to share their own experiences. However, the fact that the person was already struggling with depression and had admitted their shame suggests that the context was important. The friend should have considered the potential impact of sharing those images, especially knowing how the person felt about it.\n\nAlso, the person who ended the friendship did block them and stop calls. That's a strong reaction, but given the circumstances, maybe it's understandable. The other friends saying it's an overreaction might not take into account the emotional state of the person. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the person ending the friendship might not be in the wrong. The friend who posted the pictures is at fault for violating trust and not respecting privacy. The author's actions are a response to that breach, so they're justified.\n"
