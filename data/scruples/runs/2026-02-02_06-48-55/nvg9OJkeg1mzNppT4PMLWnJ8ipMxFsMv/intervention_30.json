It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author had a really bad depression episode, their apartment was super messy, and two friends helped clean. One of them, a 12-year friend, posted pictures of the messy apartment online with jokes. The author is upset and ended the friendship, but others say they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They were struggling with depression, which is a serious mental health issue. The fact that their apartment was a mess and they felt ashamed about it makes sense. They trusted their friends to help in confidence, and the friend shared that private information publicly. That's a breach of trust. Even if the friend meant well by helping, posting the pictures without permission is a problem. The author might feel that their privacy was violated, especially when they were already vulnerable.\n\nOn the other side, the friend's defense could be that they were helping and wanted to show the progress, but that's not a valid excuse for sharing private moments without consent. Also, making jokes about someone's personal struggles can be hurtful, even if it's in a group. The friend might not have realized how bad the situation was for the author, but the author did express their discomfort. So, the friend had the information that the author was ashamed, so sharing it anyway is a breach of trust.\n\nOther friends say the author is overreacting because the friend helped clean. But helping doesn't give someone the right to share private info. Privacy and trust are important in friendships. The author's reaction is about respecting their boundaries. Ending a friendship is a big step, but if the friend violated trust, maybe the author has a right to feel that way. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend acted inconsiderately and breached privacy. The author had the right to set boundaries. So answer B.\n"
