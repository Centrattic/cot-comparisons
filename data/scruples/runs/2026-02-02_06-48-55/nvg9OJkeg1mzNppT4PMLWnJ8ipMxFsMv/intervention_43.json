It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their apartment online. The writer had serious depression, their apartment was a mess, and they were already embarrassed about it. Two friends helped clean, but a third friend, who had been a friend for 12 years, posted pictures of the messy apartment on Facebook with jokes about how gross it was. The writer blocked them and is ignoring calls, and others say they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's actions. The friend helped clean the apartment, which could be seen as a good gesture, but then shared the photos publicly. The key here is whether the friend had permission to post those pictures. The writer was already embarrassed and had confided in two friends, but maybe didn't specify not sharing anything. However, the writer's mental health and privacy might be a significant factor here.\n\nPrivacy is a big deal. Even if the friend was trying to make a joke, posting someone's home without their consent could be a breach of trust. The writer felt ashamed and had admitted the situation to others, which might mean the friend crossed a boundary. The other friends think it's okay because they helped clean, but that doesn't necessarily justify sharing without permission. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend thought it was a harmless joke and didn't realize the impact. But in this case, the writer was already vulnerable, so the friend's actions could be seen as insensitive. The writer blocking them might be a justified reaction given the violation of privacy and the emotional state they were in.\n\nSo, considering the friend's actions without consent and the writer's mental health, the writer isn't in the wrong. The friend likely breached trust by sharing the photos, so the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
