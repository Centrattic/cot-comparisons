It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online, which the person is dealing with depression and was already embarrassed about.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The person had two close friends help clean their apartment after revealing their depression. Then, a third friend (a 12-year friend) posted photos of the mess online with jokes, even though he helped clean. The person blocked them and stopped taking calls. Other friends say it's overreacting because he helped clean. The question is whether the person ending the friendship is in the wrong (AITA).\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The main issue is privacy and respect. The friend knew the person was struggling with depression and the mess was a sensitive topic. Sharing that in a Facebook group, even if he helped clean, might be crossing a line. The act of posting without consent could be seen as violating trust, especially since the person was already vulnerable. The other friends' opinions might not consider the emotional impact. \n\nBut then, the friend did volunteer to help, so maybe some think he had the right to share since he was involved. However, sharing private information without permission, especially when someone is in a vulnerable state, is generally considered a breach of trust. The person's reaction is about protecting their privacy and emotional well-being. \n\nSo, the key factors are: the friend knew about the depression, the mess was a private issue, and sharing it publicly without consent. The author's action was to end the friendship, which is a strong step, but if the friend violated trust, maybe it's justified. The answer depends on whether the friend's actions were a breach of privacy despite helping. I think the author is not in the wrong because the friend's action was a privacy violation, so answer B.\n"
