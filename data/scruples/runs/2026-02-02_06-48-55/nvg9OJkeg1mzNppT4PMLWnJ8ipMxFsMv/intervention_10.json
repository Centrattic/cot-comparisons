It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online after helping clean, and the author ending the friendship because of that.\n\nFirst, the author was dealing with depression, which made their apartment really messy. They admitted this to two close friends, and those friends volunteered to help clean. After the cleaning, one of them (a 12-year friend) posted the pictures online with jokes about the mess. The author blocked him and stopped answering calls, and others say they're overreacting because the friend helped clean.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the violation of privacy and the context of the author's mental health. The friend shared personal, sensitive information without consent. Even though they helped clean, the author was already embarrassed and vulnerable. The act of posting those pictures could be seen as insensitive, especially given the author's depression. Friends have a responsibility to respect each other's boundaries and privacy. The author's reaction, while dramatic, might be justified if the friend breached trust. On the other hand, maybe the friend thought it was a joke and didn't intend harm. But the author's feelings are valid, and privacy is important. So, the friend probably crossed a line, making the author not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
