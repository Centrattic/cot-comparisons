It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online.\n\nFirst, the context: The person was dealing with depression, their apartment was a mess, and two friends (one of 12 years) helped clean. Afterward, the 12-year friend posted pictures with jokes about how gross it was. The author blocked them and stopped taking calls, and now others are saying they overreacted. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nSo, what's the key here? The main issue is privacy and trust. The author was in a vulnerable state, admitted their home was a mess, and allowed friends to come over to help. The friend who posted the pictures did so after helping, which the author finds hurtful. They felt embarrassed, especially since they were already struggling with depression. \n\nNow, the friend's action might be seen as a breach of trust. Even though the friend helped, the author might have expected discretion. The friend made the situation public, which could be a violation of the author's trust. The other friends say it's not a big deal because he helped clean, but the author's emotional state is a factor. Depression can make such breaches more hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might not have realized the impact of their actions. Maybe they thought it was a joke. But the author felt it was an invasion of privacy. The question is whether the author overreacted. Since the author had a legitimate reason to feel hurt and the friend didn't consider their feelings, the author's reaction seems justified. Ending the friendship might be extreme, but the emotional context matters. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because the friend's actions breached trust, and the author's feelings are valid given their situation.\n"
