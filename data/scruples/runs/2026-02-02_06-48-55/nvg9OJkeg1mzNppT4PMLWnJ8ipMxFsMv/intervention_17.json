It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. So the situation is about a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online after helping clean it. The user says they had serious depression, the apartment was really bad, friends volunteered to help, but then one of them, a 12-year friend, posted the pictures with jokes. The person blocked them and now others are saying they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was going through depression, which is a serious mental health issue. They were embarrassed about their apartment's condition and even admitted they were upset about letting the friends see it. The friend who posted the pictures was someone they trusted, an older friend. The act of posting those pictures could be seen as violating privacy and trust. Even if the friend helped clean, sharing the photos without consent crosses a line. The person ending the friendship might feel betrayed, especially under those circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have thought it was a joke or that they were helping by sharing the situation. But the key here is that the person who posted it knew how embarrassed their friend was. So there's an intention to mock or humiliate, which is a problem. The other friends saying it's okay just because he helped might not understand the emotional impact.\n\nSo the author's actions (blocking and cutting off) could be a reaction to a breach of trust. They were in a vulnerable state, and the friend's action added to their stress. Whether it's right to end the friendship is debatable, but the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the friend's action was the initial breach, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B, No. The author is not in the wrong.\n"
