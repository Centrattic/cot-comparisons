It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend posting pictures of the author's messy apartment online, leading to the author cutting off that friend. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was dealing with depression, their apartment was a mess, which is embarrassing. Friends helped clean, but one friend later posted pics online with jokes, making others say the author is overreacting. The author blocked the friend and is refusing calls.\n\nThe main issue here is privacy and trust. The author was vulnerable, shared their struggles, and allowed friends into their home. The friend who posted the pictures did so without permission, even though they helped clean. The other friends argue that since he helped clean, it's okay. But the author felt violated because they were already ashamed and didn't want the situation exposed.\n\nSo, the question is, was the author justified in cutting off the friend? The friend's action was a breach of privacy, especially after the author was in a vulnerable state. Even if the friend's intention was to make jokes, sharing private, sensitive information without consent is a problem. The author's reaction could be seen as a way to protect their privacy and mental health. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't realize the severity of the situation or thought it was a harmless joke. But the author's trust was broken. Friends should respect boundaries, and even if the friend helped clean, that doesn't give permission to share private content. The author's mental health and feelings of shame are valid. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The friend overstepped, and the author has the right to set boundaries. The other friends saying it's overreacting might not understand the emotional impact. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong."
