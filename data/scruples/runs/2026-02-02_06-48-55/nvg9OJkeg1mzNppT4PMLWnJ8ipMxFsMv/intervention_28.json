It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. The author had serious depression, the apartment was a mess, friends helped clean, and then one of them shared the before pictures with jokes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author felt that the friend was violating their privacy by posting those pictures, especially since they were already dealing with shame and depression. The friend's defense is that he helped clean and can post what he wants. Other friends say the author is overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy, empathy, and intent. The author trusted the friend to help clean, which implies some level of trust. The friend knew about the author's emotional state, so sharing the pictures could be seen as insensitive. Even if the friend thought it was a joke, the author's feelings were hurt because the privacy was breached. \n\nPrivacy is a big deal. People in vulnerable situations might not want certain aspects of their lives exposed, even if others see it as harmless. The friend's action could be considered a violation of that trust. The fact that the author was already in a bad mental state makes it even more important to consider their feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't realize the impact. But the author's reaction is about feeling disrespected. Ending the friendship is a strong step, but if the friend didn't respect their boundaries, it's understandable. The question is whether the author is wrong for cutting off the friend. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They had a right to feel violated, and their mental health is valid. The friend didn't respect their privacy despite knowing their struggles. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
