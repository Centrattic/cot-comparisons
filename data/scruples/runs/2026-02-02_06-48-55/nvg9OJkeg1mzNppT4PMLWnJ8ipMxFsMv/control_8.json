It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The question is about ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The person was dealing with depression, their apartment was really messy, and two friends helped clean. But one of them, a 12-year friend, later posted pictures of the apartment online with jokes about it being gross. The user blocked them and is refusing calls. Other friends say they're overreacting because the friend helped clean.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust, privacy, and the emotional state of the person. The user was already in a vulnerable state with depression. They shared their struggles with friends, and even though others helped, one friend went public with the situation. The user felt ashamed and the friend's actions might have violated their privacy. \n\nThe friend's defense is that they helped clean, so they can post about it. But the user didn't agree to that. The act of sharing private information without consent is a breach of trust. Even if the friend was trying to be funny, the user's feelings and the context (depression, shame) matter here. \n\nThe user's reaction is about protecting their privacy and emotional well-being. Ending the friendship is a consequence of a broken trust. The other friends saying it's an overreaction might not consider the user's sensitivity and the context of their mental health.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. The friend crossed a boundary, and the user has the right to set boundaries, even if it means ending the friendship. The answer should be B (No).\n"
