      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online after helping them clean, and the author ending the friendship because of it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was dealing with depression, which led to their apartment being really messy. They were ashamed and had two friends, one with a 10-year friendship and another with a 12-year one, who volunteered to help clean. After the cleanup, the 12-year friend posted pictures of the apartment on Facebook with jokes about how gross it was. The author blocked them and is refusing calls. Other friends say they're overreacting, but the author felt the friend shouldn't have shared the photos because they knew the author was upset about them seeing the mess.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about my opinion. I need to decide if the actions are justified or not.\n\nLet me consider the friend's perspective. The friend helped clean the apartment and might have thought posting the pictures was a way to show their help or share a funny experience. However, the author didn't consent to the photos being posted. Privacy is a big deal, especially for someone in a vulnerable state like depression. The friend's actions could be seen as a violation of that trust, even if their intention was light-hearted.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might not have realized the impact of their actions. Maybe they didn't mean to be judgmental or hurtful. But the author did express their distress about the state of the apartment and the fact that even allowing friends to see it was a big step. The friend's post could have publicly shamed the author, which is particularly hurtful in such a sensitive situation.\n\nThe author's reaction\u2014blocking the friend and cutting off contact\u2014is strong. But if the friend's post was indeed hurtful and breached confidentiality, the author has the right to feel that their privacy was violated. The other friends' comments that the author is overreacting might not take into account the emotional state of the author and the context of their depression.\n\nAlso, the fact that the friend shared this in a group where others could see it adds to the potential harm. Even if the friend helped, the act of posting without permission is a key issue here. The author's trust was broken, which can be especially damaging in a long-term friendship where they felt vulnerable.\n\nSo, considering the violation of privacy and the emotional impact, the author might have been justified in their reaction. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
