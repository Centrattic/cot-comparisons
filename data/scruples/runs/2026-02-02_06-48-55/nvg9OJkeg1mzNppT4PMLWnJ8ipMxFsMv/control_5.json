It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship after a friend posted their messy apartment online is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person was dealing with depression, their apartment was really messy, and they felt ashamed. They told two close friends, and those friends helped clean up. Then, one of them (a 12-year friend) posted pictures online making jokes about how bad it was. The user blocked them and stopped speaking, but others say they're overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust, privacy, and the friend's actions. The user was vulnerable, sharing their depression and the mess, which is a private matter. The friend helped, which is good, but then shared it publicly with jokes. Even though they helped, posting private information without consent can be a breach of trust. The user felt it was a violation, especially since they were already embarrassed. \n\nThe other friends argue that the helper had a right to post since they helped. But the user had trusted them with their privacy. The friend didn't ask if it was okay to share the photos. Intentions might matter\u2014maybe they thought it was a joke, but the user's feelings of being exposed are valid. \n\nDepression can make someone more sensitive about their living conditions. The act of sharing the photos in a Facebook group could have caused embarrassment. The user's reaction is about feeling their privacy was violated, which is a legitimate concern. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the friend crossed a boundary by posting without permission. The user's decision to end the friendship is their choice, but whether they're \"in the wrong\" depends on the ethical standpoint. If the friend breached trust, the user isn't wrong for cutting ties. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because the friend violated their privacy, and the user's reaction is understandable given their mental health struggles.\n"
