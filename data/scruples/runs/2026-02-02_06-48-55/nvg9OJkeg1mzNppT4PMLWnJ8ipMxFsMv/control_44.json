It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. The author had been dealing with depression, and their apartment was really messy. Two friends helped clean, one of whom is a 12-year friend. Afterward, that friend posted pictures and jokes about the apartment on Facebook. The author blocked them and ignored calls, and now others say they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points here are trust and boundaries. The author was in a vulnerable state, dealing with depression, and their privacy was breached. The friend helped clean, which shows they were involved in the situation. However, posting pictures of such a personal and sensitive space without consent is a big issue. Even if the friend helped, sharing that content could be seen as violating the author's trust. The author felt ashamed and stressed about the situation, so the friend's actions might have exacerbated their feelings.\n\nThe other friends say the author is overreacting because the friend helped clean. But that doesn't excuse the friend's actions. Helping clean and respecting privacy are separate things. The friend knew how the author felt about having people see the apartment, so sharing it publicly is a betrayal. The author's reaction\u2014blocking and cutting off contact\u2014might be harsh, but the situation involved a breach of trust. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have addressed it more directly first, like talking to the friend about why they posted the pictures. But given the emotional state and the nature of the breach, the author's feelings are valid. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the friend's actions were a violation of privacy and trust, the author isn't necessarily wrong for ending the friendship. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
