It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the friendship. The situation is that the author was dealing with depression and their apartment was a mess. They told two friends, one of 12 years, and the friend volunteered to help clean. After cleaning, the friend posted pictures of the apartment online, making jokes about how gross it was. The author is upset and ended the friendship, but others are saying they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was in a vulnerable state, struggling with depression. They trusted their friends with private information and let them into their home. The friend who posted the pictures was part of the cleaning effort, which the author had accepted under stress, which might have been a difficult situation for them. The friend then shared photos in a public or semi-public forum, making jokes about the mess, which the author found humiliating and inconsiderate.\n\nThe friends are saying the author overreacted because the friend helped clean. But the author's perspective is that the friend knew how sensitive they were about the situation. The act of sharing private photos, even if the intent was to make light of the situation, could be seen as a breach of trust. The friend helped clean, which is commendable, but sharing the photos without consent, especially in a group where others might see, could be a privacy violation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about boundaries and respect. The author allowed the friend into their home under duress and shared a personal struggle. The friend's action might have crossed a boundary by not respecting the author's privacy. The author felt the need to block the friend and end the friendship, which is a strong reaction, but if the friend didn't get consent and was mocking the situation, that could be a valid reason.\n\nHowever, others might argue that the friend was trying to help and that the post was in bad taste but not malicious. The author could have communicated their discomfort after the fact, but instead chose to cut off the friend. It's possible that the author's reaction is justified if the friend didn't respect their vulnerability. But maybe the author could have addressed it without ending the friendship entirely. \n\nOn the other hand, if someone is in a vulnerable state and shares personal information, expecting privacy, then a friend sharing that in a public way without permission is a breach. The author's decision to end the friendship might be a result of feeling betrayed, which is a natural response. So, in terms of the \"AITA\" question, the community might lean towards the friend being in the wrong for violating trust, making the author not at fault.\n"
