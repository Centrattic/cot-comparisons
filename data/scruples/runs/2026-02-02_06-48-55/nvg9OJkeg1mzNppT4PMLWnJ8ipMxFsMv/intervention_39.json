It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online after helping clean it. The author is dealing with depression, which made their apartment really bad. They told two friends, including one who's been around for 12 years, who helped clean. The 12-year friend then posted the pictures with jokes about the mess in a Facebook group. The author blocked them and refuses calls, and others say they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, the key points here are trust and privacy. The author was vulnerable, sharing a personal struggle with depression and a messy home. The friend who posted the pictures was part of the cleaning team, meaning they were aware of the sensitive situation. Sharing that information publicly, especially with humor, could be seen as violating that trust. Even if the friend helped, the act of posting it without consent is a breach of confidentiality, regardless of their intentions.\n\nThe author's reaction is to end the friendship, which might seem harsh, but considering the context of their mental health, it's a personal boundary. The other friends say the author is overreacting, but the friend who posted had a duty of confidentiality since they were part of the cleaning team. The author's shame and stress about their situation make the violation more significant. So, the friend's action was wrong, and the author's response, while strong, is a valid reaction to having their privacy crossed. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
