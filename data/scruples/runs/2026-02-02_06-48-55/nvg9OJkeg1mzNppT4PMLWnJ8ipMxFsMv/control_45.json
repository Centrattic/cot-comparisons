It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who posted the question (the author) is in the wrong for ending a friendship after a friend shared pictures of their messy apartment online. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author was dealing with depression, their apartment was a mess, and two close friends (one a 12-year friend) helped clean. The 12-year friend later posted pictures of the apartment online, making jokes about how gross it was. The author blocked them and is cutting off contact. Others are saying the author is overreacting because the friend helped clean. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The key factors here are trust, privacy, and empathy. The author was in a vulnerable state, admitted to a serious issue (depression), and shared their personal space with friends who volunteered to help. The friend who posted the pictures knew how the author felt about the situation. Sharing that content publicly, especially with jokes, could be seen as violating the trust and not respecting the author's privacy.\n\nEven though the friend helped clean, that doesn't give them the right to share private moments without consent. The author's reaction is about feeling disrespected and hurt, which is valid. The other friends saying it's an overreaction might not fully grasp the emotional impact. The friend's action could be seen as insensitive, especially considering the author's mental health struggles.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't intend harm, but intent isn't the only factor here. The impact matters too. The author's decision to end the friendship might be a response to feeling betrayed. Whether it's justified depends on the relationship's context, but given the circumstances, the friend's action was a breach of trust. So the author isn't in the wrong for cutting ties. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
