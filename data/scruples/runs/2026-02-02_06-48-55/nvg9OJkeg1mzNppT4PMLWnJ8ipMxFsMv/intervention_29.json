It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. The author had depression, the apartment was really messy, and two friends helped clean. One of them, the 12-year friend, later posted pictures along with jokes about how gross it was. The author blocked him and is now ignoring calls, and others say they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had a private, sensitive situation\u2014depression and a messy home. They might have felt vulnerable and trusted their friends to keep it confidential. The friend who posted the pictures did help, so maybe they thought they had permission or that it wasn't a big deal. But the author was upset because they didn't want others to see that. \n\nWas the friend justified in posting the pictures? Probably not. Even if they helped, sharing someone's private, messy living conditions in a group with jokes could be very hurtful. The author trusted them, and the friend violated that trust. The friend's actions might have been meant as a joke, but it's still a privacy issue. \n\nThe other friends say it's overreacting because he helped. But that doesn't mean he could share the content. Privacy and consent matter. The author had the right to expect that the pictures wouldn't be shared, especially given their mental health struggles. \n\nEnding the friendship is a strong step, but if the friend breached trust, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, maybe the author should have addressed it first before blocking. But given the context, the friend's action was a violation. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
