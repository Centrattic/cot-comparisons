It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online after helping clean it, and the author ended the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author had depression and a messy apartment. Two friends, including one of 12 years, came to help clean. Then the 12-year friend posted the pictures online with jokes about how gross it was. The author felt violated and cut off that friend, but others say they're overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's vulnerability (depression, messy apartment), the trust of having friends help clean, and then the friend sharing that private information without consent. The friend's action might be seen as a breach of trust, especially since the author was already embarrassed.\n\nThe other friends think it's okay because he helped clean. But the author's main issue is that the friend shared private content without permission. Even if the friend had a good reason, like helping clean, posting the pictures without consent is a boundary issue. The author's feelings of shame and the context of their mental health might make this a serious breach.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, we often consider intent and impact. The friend might not have meant to hurt, but the impact was significant. The author had the right to privacy, especially in their home. The fact that they had to admit the mess to friends and were already stressed shows they were in a vulnerable state. The friend's action could have deepened their depression or made them feel exposed.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend thought it was a joke among friends and didn't realize the severity. But consent is key here. Even if the friend thought it was okay, posting without permission is problematic. So the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship. They had a right to feel violated and set boundaries. The answer should be B (No).\n"
