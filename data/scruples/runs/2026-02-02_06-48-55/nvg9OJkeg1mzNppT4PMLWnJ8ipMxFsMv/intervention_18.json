It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for ending a friendship after their friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. The context is that the person was dealing with depression, their apartment was in bad shape, and two friends helped clean. One of them, a 12-year friend, later posted pictures and jokes about it on Facebook. The person blocked them and stopped answering calls.\n\nFirst, the key points: The friend helped clean, which might give them a sense of familiarity, but the person was already embarrassed and vulnerable. The friend shared private information without permission, which is a privacy issue. Even though they helped, sharing the situation without consent could be seen as invasive. The other friends say it's not a big deal because they helped, but the original person felt violated.\n\nThe question is whether the original person is in the wrong for ending the friendship. The friend's action of posting without consent is a breach of trust, especially when the person was already struggling. The fact that the friend made jokes adds to the disrespect. On the other hand, maybe the friend thought it was just being honest and sharing a story they were part of, thinking they had permission since they helped clean. \n\nBut the main issue is consent. The person didn't agree to their private, messy apartment being shared publicly. Even if the friend had good intentions, sharing such personal information without consent is problematic. The original person's reaction is about protecting their privacy and emotional well-being, which is valid. So, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship because the friend violated their trust and privacy.\n"
