It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online, which the person was already dealing with depression and felt ashamed about.\n\nSo the key points here are trust and privacy. The friend helped clean the apartment after the person admitted their struggle with depression. That shows a level of trust because they had to let someone into their personal, messy space. Then, the friend went ahead and posted those pictures publicly, making jokes about it. That feels really violating. Even if the friend helped clean, sharing that without consent is a breach of privacy. \n\nThe other friends are saying it's not a big deal because he helped clean, but that doesn't justify sharing someone's private situation without permission. The person ended the friendship because they were already vulnerable and the friend didn't respect that. The action of posting the pictures could be seen as cruel and not supportive, especially given the context of depression. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They had a right to expect privacy and respect, especially after confiding in the friend about their mental health. The friend's actions were a violation, so cutting them off isn't an overreaction.\n"
