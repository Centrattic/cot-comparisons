It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friendship ending because a friend posted pictures of the author's messy apartment online. The author was dealing with depression, which led to their apartment being in a bad state. They had two friends help clean, and one of them (a 12-year friend) later posted pictures of the apartment in a Facebook group, making jokes about it. The author blocked the friend and stopped answering calls, and now others are saying they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was in a vulnerable state due to depression, which caused the mess. They were embarrassed and felt ashamed, so they didn't want the apartment to be seen. The friend who posted the pictures was part of the cleaning effort, so maybe they thought they had permission. However, the author explicitly mentioned being upset about others seeing the apartment. The friend shared it without consent, even if they helped clean. \n\nRespecting privacy is important. Even if the friend helped clean, the author had the right to expect that their personal, private space (especially in a vulnerable state) wouldn't be shared publicly. The friend's actions could be seen as violating that trust. The author's reaction is about protecting their dignity and mental health. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the friend was just being honest and trying to be humorous, and that they had the intention to help. But the main issue is consent. The author didn't give permission for the pictures to be shared, especially in a public forum with jokes, which could be hurtful. The author's mental health context adds weight to their feelings of violation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the author didn't consent to the pictures being posted, then the friend overstepped. The author's reaction is a valid response to a breach of trust and privacy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
