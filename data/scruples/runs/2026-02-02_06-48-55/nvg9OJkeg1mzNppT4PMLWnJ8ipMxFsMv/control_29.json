It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online, which the person found degrading because they were dealing with depression.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person was struggling with depression, leading to a very messy apartment. They confided in two friends, who then helped clean. One of them, a 12-year friend, later shared pictures in a Facebook group with jokes about the mess. The person blocked them and cut off contact. Others say they overreacted, but the person feels violated.\n\nThe key points here are trust and privacy. When someone shares personal struggles and allows others into their home, there's an expectation of confidentiality. The friend helped clean, which might be seen as a good deed, but posting pictures without permission could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially when it's a sensitive topic like mental health issues. Even if the friend helped, sharing that information publicly could be hurtful and a breach of trust. The fact that the person was already ashamed and vulnerable makes it worse.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't intend harm, just thought it was a joke. But intentions don't always excuse actions, especially when it comes to privacy. The person's reaction is about feeling disrespected and their privacy violated, which is a valid concern.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The friend's action was a breach of trust, and the author had the right to feel that their privacy was violated. Others might see it as overreacting, but given the context of depression and the trust involved, the author's reaction makes sense.\n"
