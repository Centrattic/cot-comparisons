It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online, which was part of helping them clean. The person felt ashamed and the friend did it in a group with jokes, which seems hurtful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. The friend was invited into their home, which is a private space. Even though they were helping clean, sharing photos without permission is a breach of trust. The person was already dealing with depression, so the situation is sensitive. The friend made fun of the mess, which might have been unkind.\n\nThe other friends say it's not a big deal because he helped clean. But that doesn't justify sharing private content. The person might have felt vulnerable, and the friend's actions could have made them feel embarrassed. Ending the friendship is a strong move, but maybe the friend crossed a line. The key issue is consent. Did the friend ask if it was okay to post the pictures? If not, then sharing them without permission is wrong. The person has the right to their privacy, even if their home was messy. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for cutting ties. The answer is B.\n"
