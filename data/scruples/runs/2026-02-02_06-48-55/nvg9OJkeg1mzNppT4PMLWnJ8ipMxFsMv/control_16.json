It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who ended their friendship is in the wrong. The situation is that a close friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online, which the user was already embarrassed about due to depression. The friend had helped clean the apartment, and then later shared the photos with jokes, which the user found hurtful. They blocked the friend and are cutting them off, but others say the user is overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user was dealing with depression and a messy home, which is a sensitive situation. They were already ashamed and had to open up to two close friends. The friend who posted the pictures had volunteered to help clean, showing they were aware of the user's situation. Even though the friend helped clean, sharing the photos afterward without permission could be seen as violating trust. \n\nThe user's reaction is to block and cut off communication, which some might see as harsh. But others might argue that the friend's actions were hurtful and crossed a boundary. The key points are confidentiality and respect for the user's privacy. The friend knew how the user felt about the situation and sharing it publicly could exacerbate their depression. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the friend's actions were just a prank and not malicious, and that the user is overreacting. However, given the context of the user's mental health and the trust involved, the friend's action could be a breach of that trust. The user's decision to end the friendship is their choice, but whether they're in the wrong depends on the friend's intent and the user's right to privacy. \n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong here. The friend's action was a breach of trust, and the user has the right to set boundaries, especially regarding their mental health. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
