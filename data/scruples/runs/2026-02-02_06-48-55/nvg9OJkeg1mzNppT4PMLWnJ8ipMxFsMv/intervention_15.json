It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online.\n\nFirst, the person was dealing with depression, and their apartment was really messy. They told two close friends, including one who had been a friend for 12 years, who then helped clean. But later, the 12-year friend posted pictures of the apartment on Facebook with jokes about it being gross. The writer blocked them and stopped taking their calls, and others are saying they're overreacting. The writer is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. The key points are the context of the person's mental health, the trust involved because the friends were helping them clean, and the act of sharing private, sensitive information publicly. \n\nSo the person trusted their friend to keep their situation private. Even though the friend helped, posting those pictures could be seen as a breach of trust. The writer was already embarrassed about their living conditions, and the friend's actions might have caused further distress. The other friends say he's allowed to post because he helped clean, but that doesn't mean he had the right to share without permission. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't realize how sensitive it was. But the writer had already expressed being upset about others seeing, so the friend should have respected that. \n\nThe writer's reaction\u2014blocking and cutting off contact\u2014is a strong move. But given the context of mental health and the breach of trust, maybe it's justified. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong. If the friend violated their privacy, the writer isn't wrong for getting upset. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
