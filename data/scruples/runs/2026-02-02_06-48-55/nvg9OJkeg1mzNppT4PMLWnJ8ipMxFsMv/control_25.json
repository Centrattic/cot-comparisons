It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. \n\nFirst, the writer had serious depression, leading to a really messy apartment. They were already ashamed and had two friends help clean. The friend of 12 years posted pictures in a Facebook group with jokes about the mess. The writer blocked them, stopped answering calls, and now others are saying they're overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here: the writer was vulnerable, had a trusting relationship with the friend, and the friend shared private information without consent. The writer's action was a response to a breach of trust. The friends who helped were known to the writer, but the friend who posted pictures did so publicly, which could be embarrassing. The writer's friends are defending the poster, saying they can post whatever because they helped clean. But the writer felt violated because they were already struggling with depression and didn't want their situation shared.\n\nNow, considering privacy and trust. Sharing someone's personal, messy living conditions without consent, especially when they were in a vulnerable mental state, is a breach of trust. The friend's justification (they helped clean) doesn't negate the lack of permission. The writer's reaction, while cutting off communication, is a response to that violation. Others might argue that the friend was just being honest, but the main issue is the lack of consent. So, the writer isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
