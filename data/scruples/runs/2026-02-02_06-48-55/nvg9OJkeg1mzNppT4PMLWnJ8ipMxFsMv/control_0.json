It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author was struggling with depression, their apartment was in a bad state, and two friends (one a 12-year friend) helped clean. Then, the 12-year friend posted pictures of the messy apartment in a Facebook group with jokes about it being gross. The author blocked them and stopped answering calls, and now others are saying the author is overreacting.\n\nSo the key points here are trust and privacy. The author was vulnerable, dealing with depression, and let friends into their home to help. The friend who posted the pictures did so without permission, which could be a breach of trust. Even though the friend helped, sharing personal and private information without consent can be hurtful, especially when the person is already in a sensitive state.\n\nThe author's friends are saying they're overreacting because the friend helped clean. But the act of posting the pictures isn't just about the act of cleaning; it's about respecting privacy. The author might have trusted that their situation was confidential. The friend's actions could be seen as mocking the author's vulnerability, which is unkind.\n\nAlso, the author is blocking the friend and cutting off communication, which is a strong action, but given the context of the breach of trust and the emotional state of the author, it's understandable. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's actions were inappropriate regardless of their intent to help. The author has the right to privacy and emotional boundaries.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the friend violated their privacy, and the author has the right to protect their boundaries, especially during a vulnerable time.\n"
