It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online, which the person found out through screenshots. The apartment was really messy because they were dealing with depression. Two friends helped clean, but one of them, who's been a friend for 12 years, posted the pictures with jokes in a Facebook group. The person blocked them and stopped answering calls. Others are saying they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. The friend was invited into a private space that was already a source of shame for the person. Even though the friend helped clean, sharing those images without permission is a breach of privacy. The person was vulnerable, and the friend shared that vulnerability publicly for humor, which could be hurtful.\n\nNext, intent matters. The friend might have thought it was a joke or meant to downplay the situation, but the context of depression and the person's feelings about their apartment being a mess adds weight. The friend's action could be seen as insensitive, not respecting the trust of being in a private space.\n\nAlso, the fact that the person had already admitted the mess to two friends and was stressed about it shows they were in a tough spot. The friend's action might have made that vulnerability feel exposed and mocked, leading to justified anger and decision to end the friendship.\n\nOther friends say it's not a big deal because he helped clean, but that's not a valid justification for sharing private images. Helping clean doesn't grant permission to share photos. Privacy breaches are generally not excused by prior actions.\n\nSo, the person ending the friendship is a reaction to a privacy violation and feeling disrespected. The friend's action was likely crossing a boundary, so the person isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
