It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ended a friendship after their friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person had serious depression leading to a very messy apartment. They confided in two friends (10 and 12 years) who helped clean. The 12-year friend later posted pictures of the apartment online with jokes, which the person found hurtful. They blocked the friend and stopped taking calls, and other friends say they're overreacting.\n\nThe key points here are trust and privacy. When you help someone with a sensitive issue, especially one related to mental health, there's an expectation of confidentiality. The friend's action of sharing pictures without permission can be seen as a breach of trust. Even though the friend helped clean, the act of posting it publicly, especially with jokes, might have added humiliation, which is worse during a vulnerable time.\n\nOther friends argue that the friend can post whatever he wants because he helped. But that's not about right or wrong in terms of privacy. Just because someone helped doesn't mean they can share personal information without consent.\n\nThe person ending the friendship might be reacting to a violation of trust. It's their right to set boundaries. They might feel betrayed, which is a valid emotional response. Other friends' opinions that it's overreacting don't negate the hurt caused.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to privacy and to be respected, especially during a vulnerable time. The friend's actions were inappropriate regardless of the prior help. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
