It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ended the friendship was in the wrong. The situation involves a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online, which the person was already struggling with due to depression.\n\nFirst, the key points are: the person was dealing with depression, their apartment was in a bad state, and trusted friends helped clean. Then, one friend (the one with 12-year friendship) posted pictures and jokes about the mess in a Facebook group. The author blocked this friend and stopped returning calls. Others say they're overreacting because the friend helped clean.\n\nThe main issue here is the violation of trust and privacy. The author was already vulnerable, sharing their struggles with depression and the state of their apartment. The friend's action of posting those pictures, despite knowing the author's feelings about the situation, is a breach of trust. Even if helping was involved, sharing personal and sensitive information without consent is inappropriate. The severity of the offense depends on the context. Since the author was ashamed and the friend knew how upset they were about having others see the apartment, posting it publicly in a group with jokes likely caused emotional harm. The reaction of blocking and cutting off contact seems like a reasonable response to such a breach, especially given the author's mental health struggles. The other friends suggesting it's an overreaction might not fully grasp the emotional impact. Therefore, the friend who posted the pictures is in the wrong, not the author. The author had the right to set boundaries after the trust was broken.\n"
