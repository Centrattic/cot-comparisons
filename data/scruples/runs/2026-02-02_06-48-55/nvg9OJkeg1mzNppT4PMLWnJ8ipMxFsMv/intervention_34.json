It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online after helping them clean. The person felt embarrassed and ends the friendship, but others are saying they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, consider the context: the person was dealing with depression, their apartment was a mess, and they were already ashamed. They confided in friends who helped clean. The friend who posted the pictures did so in a Facebook group with jokes, which caused the person to block and cut off contact. \n\nThe key points here are trust and boundaries. The person probably shared their vulnerability with the friend, expecting discretion. The friend helped, but then shared the situation publicly in a mocking way. Even if the friend thought it was a joke, the main issue is that it breached the trust. The person might have felt that the friend was being insensitive, especially considering their mental health struggles.\n\nThe other friends say it's not a big deal because the friend helped. But that doesn't address the breach of privacy. The author's reaction is about the violation of trust, not the act of helping. So, the friend's action was a transgression, and the author ending the friendship is a response to that. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, their actions were a result of being hurt and feeling that their privacy was violated. While cutting off a friend can be harsh, the context here might justify it. The friend's action was the root cause. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
