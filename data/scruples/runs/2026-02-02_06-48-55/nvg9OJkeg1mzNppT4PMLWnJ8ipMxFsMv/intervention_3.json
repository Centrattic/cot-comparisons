It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person was dealing with depression, their apartment was really messy, and they were embarrassed. Two friends, including one of 12 years, helped clean. Then the friend posted pictures with jokes about the mess on Facebook. The person blocked them and stopped taking calls, leading to others saying they're overreacting.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. The friend helped clean, so maybe they thought sharing the before/after was harmless or even a kind gesture. But the key here is that the person was already upset about their situation and had shared their struggles. The friend knew how sensitive this was. Posting it publicly without permission could be a breach of trust. Even if the friend thought it was a joke, it's about respecting boundaries. The author felt violated, so their reaction might be justified. The friends who say they're overreacting might not realize the emotional impact. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
