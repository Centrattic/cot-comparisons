It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. The author was dealing with depression, had a really bad apartment situation, and two friends helped clean. But a friend of 12 years posted the pictures and jokes about the mess in a Facebook group. The author blocked them and is now ignoring their calls. Other friends say it's an overreaction because the friend helped clean. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries. The author was in a vulnerable state, struggling with depression. They admitted the apartment was a mess and were ashamed. When friends offered help, maybe they shared their feelings with those two. The friend who posted the pictures was part of that cleaning group. But by sharing the photos online with jokes, the friend potentially violated the trust and privacy. The author felt embarrassed and ashamed already; having that exposed publicly could be a betrayal.\n\nThe friend's argument is that they helped clean, so they could post about it. But that doesn't mean they have the right to share private details, especially without consent. Even if they had good intentions, sharing images that reveal someone's personal struggles without permission is problematic. The author's reaction is about protecting their privacy and mental health. Ending the friendship might be a strong move, but given the context, it's understandable. The friend's actions could be seen as thoughtless, not respecting the author's privacy and emotional state. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't realize the impact. But the author made their discomfort clear. The friend's actions led to public humiliation, which exacerbates the author's depression. The other friends are dismissing the author's feelings, but the core issue is the violation of trust. So the author isn't in the wrong for cutting off a friend who breached their privacy, especially when the author was already in a fragile state. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
