      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. The context is that they were dealing with serious depression, the apartment was really dirty, and two friends (specifically a 12-year friend) helped them clean. But a week later, that friend posted the pictures in a Facebook group with jokes about how gross it was.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The user was in a vulnerable state, with depression leading to a messy home. They felt ashamed and allowed friends to help, which they found stressful. The 12-year friend then shared the photos and made jokes about it, which the user found hurtful. They blocked the friend and are ignoring calls, and others are saying they're overreacting. The question is whether the user is in the wrong.\n\nI think about trust and boundaries. When someone is struggling with mental health, sharing their space can be a big deal. The user admitted the mess was a problem and allowed friends to help, which suggests they might have felt uncomfortable or embarrassed. The friend's action of posting the pictures could be seen as a violation of that trust. Even if the friend helped, sharing private, sensitive information without permission isn't right. \n\nAlso, the friend of 12 years knows the user's personal situation. Making jokes about it might be mocking the user's vulnerability, which is hurtful. The user's reaction is understandable because they felt the friend breached their privacy. It's not just about the act of posting; it's about the context and the emotional impact. \n\nThe other friends' opinion that it's okay because he helped might be missing the point. Helping doesn't give someone the right to share private moments. The user has every right to set boundaries and be upset. Ending the friendship might be a strong step, but if the friend crossed a line and showed a lack of respect for their feelings, it's not necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the friend violated their privacy and didn't respect their emotional state. The user had the right to feel hurt and take action to protect their privacy.\n"
