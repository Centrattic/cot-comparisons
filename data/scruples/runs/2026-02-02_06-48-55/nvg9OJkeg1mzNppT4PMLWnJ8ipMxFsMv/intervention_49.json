It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. \n\nFirst, the context is that the author was dealing with depression, their apartment was really messy, and two friends helped clean. The friend of 12 years posted pictures online making jokes about the mess. The author is now blocking them and avoiding calls, and others say the author is overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy, intent, and the nature of the friendship. The author had a vulnerable situation, and they trusted friends to help without sharing details. The friend's action was to post the pictures publicly, which could be seen as violating that trust. Even though the friend helped, sharing personal photos without consent is a breach of privacy. \n\nThe author might feel that the friend didn't consider their feelings and exposed them to embarrassment, especially during a time of vulnerability. The other friends think it's justified because the friend helped, but that doesn't necessarily mean they had the right to share the images. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend thought they were being helpful and didn't realize the impact. But even with good intentions, sharing private photos is a line that's crossed. The author's reaction is about protecting their privacy and emotional well-being. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship. The friend's action was the breach. Therefore, answer B.\n"
