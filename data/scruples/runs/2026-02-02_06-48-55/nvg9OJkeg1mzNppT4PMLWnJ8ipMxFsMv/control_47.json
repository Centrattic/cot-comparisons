It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online, leading to the author ending the friendship. \n\nFirst, the author was dealing with depression and their apartment was in a bad state. They confided in two friends, including one they've known for 12 years, who helped clean. But later, this friend posted pictures online with jokes about how gross it was. The author blocked them and others say they're overreacting.\n\nSo, why would the author be wrong? Maybe because the friend helped clean and thought sharing the situation was okay. Maybe there's a difference in perspectives here. The friend might have thought they were being supportive by cleaning and then humorously commenting, but the author felt humiliated. \n\nBut the author had specifically trusted these friends with a sensitive personal issue (depression and a messy home). The friend who posted the pictures did so without permission, which could be a breach of trust. The other friends might argue that the first friend had a right to post since they helped clean, but the author's privacy was violated. \n\nThe key points are consent and trust. The author didn't give permission for their home to be shared publicly, especially in a way that mocks their situation. Even if the friend helped, sharing without consent could be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might not have intended harm, just thought it was a joke. But the author's reaction is about feeling humiliated in a vulnerable moment. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the friend who posted the pictures likely violated trust and privacy. The author's response of ending the friendship is a reaction to that breach. Other friends saying it's overreacting might not understand the context of the author's mental health. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship because the friend's actions were a breach of trust and privacy. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
