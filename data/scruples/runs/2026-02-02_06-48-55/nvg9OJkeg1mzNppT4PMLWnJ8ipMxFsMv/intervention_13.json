It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about ending a friendship because a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. The friend had helped clean it, and others are saying the author is overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The author was dealing with depression, leading to a messy apartment. They were embarrassed and had two close friends (10 and 12 years) help clean. The 12-year friend later posted pictures in a Facebook group with jokes about the mess. The author blocked them and ignored calls, and others are saying they overreacted. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's mental health, the trust they placed in their friends, and the friend's breach of that trust. The friend helped clean, which might be seen as a good deed, but then shared the pictures without permission. The author felt the privacy was violated, especially since they were already vulnerable. The other friends' reactions suggest they don't see the issue, but the author does. \n\nI need to consider the moral aspect. Did the friend have the right to post those pictures? The author didn't consent, so it's a privacy issue. The friend's intention might be to make jokes, but sharing someone else's personal space without permission can be hurtful, especially when the person is struggling. The author's reaction is based on feeling embarrassed and violated. \n\nThe options are A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the scenario. The friend's action was a breach of trust and privacy. The author had a legitimate reason for feeling upset. So, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship. Others might not understand the context, but the author's mental state and the trust issue are important. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
