It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending a friendship after their friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person was dealing with depression, their apartment was a mess, and they felt ashamed. Two old friends, including a 12-year friend, helped them clean. But later, the 12-year friend posted pictures of their apartment in a Facebook group with jokes about how gross it was. The author blocked them and stopped taking calls, and now others are saying they're overreacting.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are trust, boundaries, and understanding the person's mental state. The friend was helping with a sensitive situation where the author was already vulnerable. The act of posting those pictures could be seen as a violation of trust, especially if the author had shared their embarrassment and vulnerability beforehand. Even if the friend helped, that doesn't necessarily give them permission to share private photos without consent. \n\nThe author might have felt that the friend didn't respect their privacy or the emotional context. Friends who helped might have known how hard it was for the author to let them in, so posting jokes about it could come off as insensitive. On the other hand, some might argue that the friend isn't obligated to keep such pictures private unless there was an explicit agreement. But considering the author's mental health and the context, the friend might have overstepped. \n\nThe other friends saying it's an overreaction might not fully grasp the emotional impact. The author's decision to end the friendship could be a reaction to a breach of trust, which is a valid response. So, in this case, the friend might be at fault for not respecting the author's privacy and the sensitive situation. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their boundaries, especially when their mental health was already compromised. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
