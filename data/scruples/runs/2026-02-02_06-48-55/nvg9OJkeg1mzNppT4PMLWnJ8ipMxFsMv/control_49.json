It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. \n\nFirst, the person had been struggling with depression, which led to their apartment being in a really bad state. They confided in two friends, who then helped them clean. Afterward, one of those friends, a 12-year friend, posted pictures of the apartment on Facebook with jokes, and the person blocked them and stopped answering calls. Now others are saying they overreacted.\n\nHmm. So the key points are: the friend knew the person was dealing with depression and the mess was a sensitive issue. They helped clean, which suggests they were aware of the situation's sensitivity. Then they posted the pictures, which is the problem. The person ended the friendship, and others are saying it's okay because the friend helped clean. But the person in question felt that the friend violated their trust by sharing the pictures without permission.\n\nI think the main issue is privacy. Even though the friend helped clean, posting personal, private information (like the state of someone's home) without consent is a breach of trust. Especially when the person was already vulnerable due to depression. The friend's actions could be seen as mocking or insensitive, even if they made jokes. The fact that the person was upset about others seeing it in the first place means that sharing it without permission was wrong. \n\nThe friends who are saying it's not a big deal might not realize the emotional impact. The person in the story had a right to privacy and to feel safe with their friends. So the action of posting the pictures is the issue. The person ending the friendship might be a strong reaction, but given the circumstances, it's understandable. They're protecting their mental health. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
