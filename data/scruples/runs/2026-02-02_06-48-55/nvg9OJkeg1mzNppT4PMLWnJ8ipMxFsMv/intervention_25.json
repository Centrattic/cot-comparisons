It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online after helping clean it. The person is dealing with depression and the apartment being a mess was a sensitive issue.\n\nFirst, the key points: The friend helped clean the apartment after the author admitted their depression. Then, the friend posted pictures and jokes about the mess in a Facebook group. The author blocked them and stopped taking calls, others say it's overreacting.\n\nSo, the author's actions were to end the friendship. The question is whether they are in the wrong. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure.\n\nI need to consider privacy and trust. The author was vulnerable, sharing their depression and the state of their home. The friend, despite helping, violated that trust by posting the pictures. Even if the friend thought it was a joke, it was a breach of privacy. The author might feel betrayed, leading to cutting off the friend. Others might say the friend had the right to post it since they helped, but the context of the author's vulnerability is important. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily wrong for ending the friendship if they felt it was a betrayal. The friend's action was inappropriate regardless of the cleanup. So the answer might be B (author not in the wrong). But need to make sure.\n"
