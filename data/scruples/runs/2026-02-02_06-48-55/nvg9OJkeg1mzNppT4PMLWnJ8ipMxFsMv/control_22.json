It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that they had a really bad time with depression, their apartment was a mess, and they told two close friends. Those friends helped them clean. But then one of them, a 12-year friend, posted pictures of the apartment online in a Facebook group, making jokes about how gross it was. The writer blocked them and is cutting them off, but other friends say they're overreacting because the friend helped clean.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy and trust. The writer was in a vulnerable state and shared their problem with friends. They might not have wanted that information or images of their home shared publicly, especially when it's related to a personal struggle. The friend who posted the pictures might have thought it was a harmless joke, but the writer felt violated. \n\nThen there's the aspect of consent. Did the writer give permission for the friend to take and share those pictures? Probably not. Even if the friend was involved in cleaning, that doesn't mean they had the right to post them without consent. The friend's actions could be seen as a breach of trust, especially since the writer was already embarrassed and struggling.\n\nThe writer's reaction is to block and cut off contact, which is a strong move, but maybe justified given the violation of privacy. The friends who say it's not a big deal might not understand the emotional impact. The writer's mental health was already compromised, and the post could have added to their stress or made them feel judged.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't realize the severity of the situation. But the writer explicitly mentioned being upset about others seeing the apartment, so the friend should have known better. The fact that they made jokes about it in a public forum might indicate they were mocking the situation, which is insensitive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the writer isn't in the wrong. The friend who posted the pictures acted inconsiderately and without permission. The writer's reaction is about protecting their dignity and mental health. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
