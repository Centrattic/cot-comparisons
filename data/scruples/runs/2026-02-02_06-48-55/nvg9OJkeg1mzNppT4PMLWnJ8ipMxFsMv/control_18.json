It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. The key points here are about trust, privacy, and the context of their situation.\n\nFirst, the user was dealing with serious depression, leading to a very messy apartment. They admitted this to two close friends who then helped clean. One of these friends, a 12-year friend, later posted pictures of the apartment on Facebook with jokes about how gross it was. The user blocked them and stopped taking their calls. Now, others are saying the user is overreacting because the friend helped clean and has a right to post whatever.\n\nThe main issue is whether the friend violated the user's privacy. The user was clearly embarrassed and vulnerable when they allowed the friends into their home. The act of posting those pictures in a public group, especially with jokes, could be seen as crossing a boundary. Even though the friend helped, the user trusted them not to share personal, sensitive information without permission. The friend's action was a breach of that trust, regardless of their intention to help. The user's reaction is about protecting their privacy and emotional well-being, which is valid. Others might argue about free speech, but in this context, the trust was broken. So, the user isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship. Answer B.\n"
