It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who posted pictures of their messy apartment online after helping them clean. The writer ended the friendship and others are saying they're overreacting. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The writer was dealing with depression, their apartment was a mess, which they were ashamed of. They told two friends, including a 12-year friend, who helped clean. Later, that friend posted pictures and jokes about the mess on Facebook. The writer blocked them and stopped responding, and now others are saying they're overreacting.\n\nThe main issue here is privacy. The friend shared private, sensitive information without consent. Even if the friend helped clean, that doesn't give them the right to post those pictures. The writer was already vulnerable and ashamed, so the friend's action could be seen as violating trust. \n\nAlso, the writer had expressed their discomfort about the friends seeing the apartment in that state. The friend's post showed a lack of empathy and understanding. While the friend might have thought it was a joke, it crossed a boundary. \n\nOthers might argue that sharing photos isn't a big deal, but considering the context of the writer's mental health and the trust they had with the friend, it's a breach of privacy. The writer's reaction of cutting off the friend isn't necessarily over the top if they felt betrayed. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They had a right to their privacy, and the friend's actions were disrespectful. The other friends dismissing the situation as overreacting might not be considering the emotional impact.\n"
