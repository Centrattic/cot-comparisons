It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online after helping clean it, which the person found hurtful due to their depression.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was dealing with depression, their apartment was a mess, and they were already ashamed. Friends helped clean, but one of them (a 12-year friend) posted pictures making jokes about the mess. The author blocked them and stopped answering calls. Others say it's overreacting because the friend helped clean, but the author felt violated.\n\nThe key points here are about consent and boundaries. Did the friend respect the author's privacy? The author was already embarrassed and vulnerable. Even though the friend helped, sharing personal, sensitive content without permission can be a breach of trust. The author's reaction is about their mental health and the violation of their privacy. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for ending the friendship? Well, they have the right to set boundaries. If the friend knew how upset the author was about the situation, posting the pictures was insensitive. The author isn't obligated to tolerate behavior that disrespects their privacy, especially when they're in a vulnerable state. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't think it was a big deal and was just making light of the situation. But given the author's mental health context, the friend should have been more considerate. The author's reaction is about protecting their emotional well-being. So, it's more about the friend crossing a line rather than the author being wrong. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
