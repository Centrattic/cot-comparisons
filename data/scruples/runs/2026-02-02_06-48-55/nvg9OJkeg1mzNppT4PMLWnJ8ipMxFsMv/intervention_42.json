      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation. \n\nThe user is dealing with serious depression, which probably made their apartment really messy. They admitted this to two old friends and those friends helped them clean. Then, one of the friends, who had been a friend for 12 years, posted pictures of the apartment online in a Facebook group with jokes about how gross it was. The user blocked them and stopped taking their calls. Now, other friends are saying the user is overreacting because the friend helped clean. The user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the user's perspective. They were in a vulnerable state, dealing with depression, and their friends knew about it. They might have been embarrassed or ashamed about their living conditions. The friends volunteered to help, which was a kind act, but then one of them shared the situation publicly in a mocking way. That could be really hurtful. The user might feel that their privacy was violated, especially since they were already struggling.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend who posted the pictures might have thought it was a lighthearted way to make the situation more bearable. Maybe they didn't realize how sensitive the user was. But the key point here is that the user had already shared their personal struggles with the friend, so the friend should have been aware of the user's feelings about the mess. Sharing it publicly with jokes could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if they meant well.\n\nThe friends who are saying the user is overreacting might not realize the emotional impact. They might be focusing on the friend's action of helping clean as justification, but that doesn't necessarily excuse the public shaming. The user's reaction is about feeling betrayed and disrespected, which is valid in a situation where someone's privacy and emotional state were compromised.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the user's reaction seems justified. They had a right to expect their privacy to be respected, especially after sharing their personal struggles. The friend's actions, while maybe intended as a joke, were hurtful and invaded the user's privacy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship. The answer should be B (No).\n"
