It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. \n\nFirst, the situation: the person was dealing with depression, their apartment was a mess, two friends helped clean. Then a third friend (the 12-year friend) posted pictures of the apartment with jokes about how gross it was, which the person found very hurtful. They blocked the friend and stopped answering calls. Some friends say they're overreacting, but the person feels the friend knew how they felt about the situation.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy and empathy. The friend helped clean, so maybe they thought it was okay to post pictures? But the person was already embarrassed and in a vulnerable state. Sharing that without consent could be a violation of trust. Even if the friend helped, posting the pictures without permission might be crossing a line. The person had admitted the mess was a problem, and the friend's action might have been insensitive. \n\nOn the other hand, people might argue that the friend was just being honest or had the right to post since they helped. But given the context of depression and the person's feelings about the situation, the friend should have respected their privacy. So, the author's reaction is understandable. They had the right to feel violated, and ending the friendship because of a breach of trust isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
