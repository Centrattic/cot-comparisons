It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online, which the author was dealing with depression and was really embarrassed about. The friend in question had helped clean the place, but then posted the pictures in a Facebook group, making jokes about the mess.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author was struggling with depression, which is a serious issue. They were already ashamed and had two friends help clean up. The friend who posted the pictures had helped, but he also knew how upset the author was about the situation. So, by posting those pictures and making jokes, even if it was in a group, he might have crossed a line. The other friends are saying he has the right to post because he helped clean, but the key point here is that the author trusted them to keep it private, especially given their emotional state.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't think it was a big deal. He might have been trying to make light of the situation or share a story. But the author felt that their privacy was violated, leading to the block and refusal to talk. The friends who think the author is overreacting might not fully understand the impact of such an action on someone already in a vulnerable state.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for cutting off the friend? Well, if the friend broke a trust by sharing private information without consent, then the author isn't wrong for responding by ending the friendship. The friend's action was a breach of privacy, which can be a valid reason to end a relationship. However, if the friend thought it was okay to post the pictures for some reason, maybe the author overreacted. But given the context of depression and shame, the author's reaction seems justified. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
