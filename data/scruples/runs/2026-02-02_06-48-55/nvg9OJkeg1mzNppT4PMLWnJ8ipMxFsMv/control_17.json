It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. So, the situation is that a friend helped them clean their messy apartment due to depression, and then that friend posted pictures online with jokes about the mess. The other friends say the author is overreacting because the friend helped clean. \n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy and boundaries. The author was in a vulnerable state, dealing with depression, and let two close friends into their home, one of whom was a 12-year friend. They trusted those friends enough to let them see their messy, possibly embarrassing situation. The act of helping clean shows some level of support, but the friend then shared pictures in a public group, making jokes about the mess. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. Did the author give permission for the friend to post those pictures? It seems not. Even though the friend was helping, sharing personal, potentially sensitive information without consent can be a breach of trust. The author was already feeling ashamed and vulnerable, so the friend's actions might have exacerbated that. \n\nOther friends are telling the author they're overreacting, but that doesn't mean the original friend did right. The fact that the friend knew how upsetting it was for the author to have others see the apartment is important. The friend's action could be seen as insensitive, even if they were trying to help. \n\nThe author's reaction of blocking and cutting off the friend is a response to a breach of trust. Whether it's justified depends on whether the friend's action was a significant violation. Since the author was in a mental health crisis and felt violated, their reaction might be reasonable. The friend's behavior could be considered a betrayal, especially if they were aware of the author's feelings about privacy. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the friend is likely in the wrong for violating privacy. The author isn't obligated to accept that behavior, especially if it's causing emotional harm. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the friendship. The answer should be B (No).\n"
