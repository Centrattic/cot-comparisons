It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for ending a friendship because their friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. The situation is that the apartment was really bad due to depression, and two friends helped clean. Then, one of them, a 12-year friend, posted pictures in a Facebook group with jokes about the mess. The author blocked them and stopped taking calls, and now others are saying they overreacted.\n\nFirst, the key points here are privacy and empathy. The author was in a vulnerable state, dealing with depression, and the friend helped them clean. Even though the friend helped, posting pictures without permission breaches privacy. The author might have felt embarrassed and violated because they were already struggling. The friend's action could be seen as insensitive, especially knowing the author's feelings about the situation. \n\nNow, the author's response was to block and cut off communication. Ending a friendship is a big step, but the question is whether they were wrong. The friend might have thought they were just having fun, but in the context of the author's mental health, it's a serious breach of trust. The other friends say the author is overreacting, but they might not see the full picture of the author's emotional state.\n\nSo, the friend who posted the pictures acted inconsiderately, but did the author overreact? If the relationship was based on trust and the friend broke that by sharing private content, the author's decision to end the friendship could be justified. However, maybe the author could have addressed the issue instead of cutting off the friend immediately. But given the context of depression and the violation of privacy, the author's reaction might be understandable. Therefore, perhaps the author is not in the wrong here. The friend's action was the primary issue, so the answer would be B (No).\n"
