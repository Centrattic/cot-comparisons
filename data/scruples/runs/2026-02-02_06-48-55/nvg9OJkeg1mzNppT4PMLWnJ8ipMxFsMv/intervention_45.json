      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a friendship ending because a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. The user was dealing with depression, their apartment was in a bad state, and two friends helped clean. But then one of them, a 12-year friend, posted pictures in a Facebook group with jokes about how gross it was. The user blocked them and stopped taking their calls. Now others say the user is overreacting because the friend helped clean, but the user feels it was wrong because the friend knew how upset they were about others seeing it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user was vulnerable, had depression, and their home was a mess. They shared this with close friends, who helped clean. The friend who posted the pictures was part of the cleaning, so he was already aware of the situation. The user felt ashamed and didn't want others to see, but the friend shared it publicly, which caused the user to end the friendship.\n\nThe main issue here is privacy and respect. The user might have trusted the friends not to share that information, especially when they were in a vulnerable state. The friend's action could be seen as a breach of that trust. Even though the friend helped clean, sharing the pictures might have crossed a line. Friends are supposed to respect each other's privacy and feelings, especially when someone is struggling.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the friend was just being honest or trying to make light of the situation. But considering the user's mental health and the context, the friend's action could be hurtful. The user's reaction is about protecting their privacy and feeling disrespected. Ending the friendship is a strong step, but if the friend's action was a violation of trust, maybe the user isn't wrong.\n\nSo, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. The friend violated their privacy, knowing their sensitive state. The user's reaction is about self-respect and boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
