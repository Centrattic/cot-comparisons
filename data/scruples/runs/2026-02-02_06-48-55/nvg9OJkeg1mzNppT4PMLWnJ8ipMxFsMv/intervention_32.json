Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online, which the author found offensive, especially since they were dealing with depression and the mess was a sensitive issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had two close friends help clean their apartment, which was in a bad state due to depression. After the cleaning, one of those friends (a 12-year friend) posted pictures of the apartment in a Facebook group with jokes about the mess. The author blocked this friend and stopped answering calls, leading to other friends saying they're overreacting.\n\nThe main issue here is whether sharing the pictures was a breach of trust. The author was vulnerable, sharing their struggles with depression and the state of their home. The friend's action might be seen as insensitive, using a private situation for public mockery. Even if the friend helped clean, the act of posting without consent could be a violation of privacy. The author's reaction is about feeling betrayed and disrespected, which is understandable given the context.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the friend was just being honest and that the author overreacted. But considering the author's mental health and the trust established by helping clean, the friend's action could have been hurtful. The author's decision to cut off contact might be a reaction to feeling that their privacy was violated and their vulnerability was exploited. \n\nIt's also important to note that while public posts can be defended as free speech, the context here involves a personal, sensitive matter. The author's feelings of shame and the breach of trust likely justified their reaction. The friends advising them might not consider the emotional impact, focusing only on the right to post. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The friend's action was inconsiderate, and the author's response, while drastic, stems from a place of hurt and violation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
