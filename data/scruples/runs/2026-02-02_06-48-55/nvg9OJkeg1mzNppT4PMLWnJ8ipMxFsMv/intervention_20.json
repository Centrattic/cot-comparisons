It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. The author was dealing with depression, their apartment was a mess, and two friends helped clean. Later, one of those friends (a 12-year friend) posted pictures online with jokes about the mess. The author blocked them and stopped taking calls, and now others say they're overreacting. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a vulnerable state with depression, which makes privacy and personal dignity important. The friend who posted the pictures had been involved in the cleaning, which the author had admitted was a stressful situation. The fact that the friend shared the photos despite knowing the author's embarrassment is a key point. Even though the friend helped, sharing private information without consent is a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have thought it was harmless teasing among friends, especially since they helped. However, the author's mental health and the trust between friends are crucial here. The friend didn't consider the emotional impact of their actions, which could be seen as insensitive. The author's decision to cut off contact is a response to a violation of trust, which is understandable given the circumstances. \n\nOthers might argue that the friend isn't in the wrong because they had the right to post what they saw, especially after helping. But the key factors are the author's mental state and the lack of consent for sharing private information. The friend's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary, making the author justified in ending the friendship. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the friend's actions were a privacy violation, especially considering the author's mental health. The author had the right to expect confidentiality after sharing their vulnerable situation.\n"
