It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online.\n\nFirst, the author was dealing with serious depression, which led to their apartment being really messy. That's a sensitive situation. They told two close friends about it, and those friends helped clean. The friend in question, who's known the author for 12 years, later posted pictures of the apartment in a Facebook group, making jokes about the mess. The author blocked them and is ignoring their calls. Others are saying the author is overreacting because the friend helped clean and has a right to post what they saw.\n\nNow, the key points here: trust and privacy. The author was vulnerable, sharing a private and distressing situation. The friend volunteered to help, which implies a level of trust. Posting those pictures without permission breaches that trust. Even if the friend helped clean, the author's privacy was violated. The fact that others are dismissing the author's feelings as an overreaction doesn't make it right. The friend's actions were hurtful and disloyal, especially considering the author's mental health. The author had every right to feel ashamed and upset. Ending the friendship is a reaction to a breach of trust, not just a minor offense. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
