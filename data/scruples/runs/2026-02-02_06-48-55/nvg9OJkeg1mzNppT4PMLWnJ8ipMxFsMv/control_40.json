Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friend of 12 years who posted pictures of their messy apartment online, after helping them clean. The person felt ashamed and had been dealing with depression, and even though the friend helped, they posted the pictures with jokes, which led to the author cutting off the friend. Others are saying they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was in a vulnerable state, dealing with depression, and their apartment was in a bad state. They told two close friends, including the 12-year friend, who then helped clean. However, the 12-year friend later posted pictures of the mess in a Facebook group with jokes. The author blocked them and stopped answering calls, and now others are saying he's just helping and can post whatever.\n\nSo, the main issue here is privacy and trust. The author trusted their friend enough to let them into their home during a difficult time, and the friend shared that private information publicly without permission. Even though the friend helped clean, the act of posting the pictures could be seen as violating that trust. The author's reaction is about feeling betrayed, especially given their mental health struggles. \n\nThe friend might argue that since they helped clean, they had a right to share the situation, but the author had confided in them about being ashamed. The friend's actions could have been hurtful, regardless of the intent. The author's decision to end the friendship might be a reaction to feeling disrespected or not supported, even if others think it's an overreaction.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the friend had good intentions by helping and maybe thought sharing the story was lighthearted. But the author's feelings of shame and the context of depression make this a sensitive situation. Trust is a big part of friendships, and if one person feels their privacy was violated, that can damage the relationship irreparably.\n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They had a right to privacy, especially when they were vulnerable. The friend's actions crossed a boundary, even if their help was well-intentioned. The author's emotional response is valid given their circumstances. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
