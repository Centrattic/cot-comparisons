It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation is that a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online, which the person found embarrassing due to depression. They had two friends help clean, one of whom is a 12-year friend. Afterward, that friend posted the photos with jokes, leading the person to cut off contact.\n\nFirst, consider the friend's actions. Sharing someone's private, messy home without consent, especially when they're already struggling with depression, seems like a privacy breach. The friend knew how sensitive the person was about it. The act of posting the photos could be seen as insensitive or mocking.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend did help with the cleaning. Some others think it's within their rights to post about something they were involved in. However, the key point is consent. Did the friend ask permission before sharing? If not, it's a violation of privacy. The person's emotional state adds context; being in a vulnerable situation shouldn't make someone a target for public ridicule.\n\nThe friends who helped were volunteers, but that doesn't give them the right to publicize the situation. The author's reaction of blocking and refusing contact might be a strong response, but their mental health is a significant factor. The friend's actions could have worsened the author's depression, making the reaction justified.\n\nSo, the friend likely overstepped by sharing without consent, and the author isn't in the wrong for ending the friendship. The answer should be B (No).\n"
