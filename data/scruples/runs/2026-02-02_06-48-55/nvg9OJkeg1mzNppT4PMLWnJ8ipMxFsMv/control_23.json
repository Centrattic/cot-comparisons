It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for ending a friendship because a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. The situation is that the person was dealing with depression, their apartment was a mess, friends helped clean, and then one of them shared pictures and jokes about it on Facebook. The user blocked them and is now getting told they're overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust and boundaries. The user was in a vulnerable state, and they had confided in their friends about their struggles. The friend who posted the pictures was part of the cleaning effort, which the user had to agree to because it was necessary. But sharing those images without permission is a big breach of trust. Even if the friend thought it was a joke, the user had made it clear they were ashamed and upset about the situation. The friend's actions made the user feel exposed and humiliated, which is valid. The other friends saying it's okay because they helped clean might not be considering the emotional impact. The user has the right to privacy, especially when they were in a vulnerable mental state. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
