It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online after helping clean it, which the author found upsetting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The friend helped clean the apartment, which was a mess due to the author's depression. The friend then posted pictures and jokes about it publicly. The author cut off contact, and others are saying they overreacted. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nI should think about boundaries. The author was already in a vulnerable state and had shared their depression. They might have expected privacy from the friend who helped, especially since they admitted their discomfort with others seeing the mess. Even if the friend helped, posting those pictures could be seen as violating trust and privacy. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have thought it was harmless or even a positive action since they helped clean up. But given the context of the author's mental health and the explicit mention of shame, sharing those images without consent is a breach of privacy. The friend's actions could be hurtful, even if they intended to help. \n\nThe author's reaction of blocking and ignoring calls could be justified if they felt disrespected. However, the response might be seen as cutting off communication abruptly. But considering the sensitivity of the situation, the author's need for privacy and respect is valid. \n\nOthers saying it's overreacting might not fully understand the emotional impact. The key here is whether the friend respected the author's boundaries. Since the author had already shared their distress about the situation, the friend's public post likely crossed a line. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the friendship if they felt their privacy and trust were violated. The friend's actions disregarded the author's feelings and vulnerability. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
