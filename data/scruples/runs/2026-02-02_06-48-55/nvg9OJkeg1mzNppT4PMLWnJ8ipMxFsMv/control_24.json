It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online after helping clean it. The person was dealing with depression, which contributed to the mess. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's actions. Sharing private photos without permission is a big deal. Even if the friend was joking, it's a violation of privacy. The person was already vulnerable because of their mental health, so sharing that content publicly could be hurtful.\n\nThen there's the part about the other friends saying it's okay because the friend helped clean. But the key point here is consent. The friend didn't ask if they could post the pictures. Even if they helped, that doesn't justify sharing someone's private space without permission.\n\nAlso, the person ended the friendship by blocking and ignoring calls. Is that an overreaction? Well, the friend breached their trust. The person was already ashamed and stressed, so the public humiliation might have been the last straw. Ending the friendship is a personal choice, but in this case, the breach of trust seems significant. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't think it was a big deal. But intent doesn't matter as much as the impact here. The result was emotional distress. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for cutting off someone who violated their privacy. \n\nSo putting it all together, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
