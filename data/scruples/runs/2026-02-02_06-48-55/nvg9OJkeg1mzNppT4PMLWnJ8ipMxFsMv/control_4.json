It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ended the friendship is at fault here.\n\nSo the situation is that the person was dealing with depression, their apartment was a mess. They told two friends, including a 12-year friend, who helped clean. Later, the 12-year friend posted pictures of the apartment online in a Facebook group with jokes about it being gross. The user blocked them and stopped answering calls. Other friends say they're overreacting, but the user feels violated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. The friend shared private information without consent. Even though they helped clean, that doesn't give them the right to post photos. The user was vulnerable and in a bad mental state, so trust was important. The friend's action might have been hurtful and breached that trust.\n\nAlso, the user was already ashamed about the situation. The friend's public shaming could have made them feel worse. Even if the friend thought it was a joke, it's not appropriate to share someone's private problems online without their permission. The other friends saying it's okay because they helped clean is a bit off; helping clean doesn't equate to sharing inappropriately.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't realize how bad it was, but the user explicitly shared their feelings about the situation. The friend knew the user was upset about others seeing the apartment, so posting it anyway is a breach of trust.\n\nSo the user's reaction of ending the friendship might be justified because the friend violated their privacy. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
