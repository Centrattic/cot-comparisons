It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is at fault here. The situation is that a close friend (12 years) posted pictures of their messy apartment online, which was a private matter due to depression. The friend had helped clean, but posting those pictures caused the person to block them and cut off contact.\n\nFirst, the key points: the apartment was a mess because of depression, the friend helped clean, then posted photos mocking the situation. The person felt ashamed and the friend violated their privacy. The other friends say it's not a big deal because he helped clean. But the person thinks it's wrong because the friend knew how they felt about others seeing it.\n\nPrivacy is a big factor here. Even if someone helps, sharing private, sensitive content without permission crosses a line. The friend's actions were public shaming, which can be hurtful, especially when the person is vulnerable. The fact that it was a Facebook group and screenshots were sent suggests it's a public post, which makes it worse. \n\nAlso, the person had only admitted the mess to two close friends. The 12-year friend went beyond that, making light of a serious issue. The response of cutting off contact might be strong, but given the violation of trust and privacy, it's understandable. The other friends saying it's overreacting might not grasp the emotional impact. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's actions were inappropriate. The answer should be B.\n"
