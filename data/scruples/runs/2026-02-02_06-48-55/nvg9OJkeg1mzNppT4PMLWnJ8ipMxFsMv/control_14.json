It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ending a friendship after a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author had been dealing with depression, their apartment was a mess, and they felt ashamed. They told two close friends, who then helped clean. The friend of 12 years posted pictures of the apartment online with jokes, which the author found hurtful. They blocked the friend and stopped taking their calls. Other friends think the author is overreacting, saying the friend helped clean, so it's okay to post.\n\nNow, considering privacy and boundaries. The author was in a vulnerable state, sharing their struggle with depression and the mess. They allowed friends into their home to clean, which is a personal space. The friend posted pictures without consent, which can be a breach of trust. Even though they helped, sharing private information without permission is a key issue here.\n\nThe friend's action might have been intended as a joke, but the context is important. The author was already feeling ashamed and vulnerable. Posting those pictures publicly could add to that shame, making the author feel that their privacy was violated. The fact that other friends are dismissing the author's feelings and justifying the friend's actions based on helping clean doesn't address the breach of trust and privacy.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, ending a friendship might be a strong reaction, but it's a personal decision. If the friend didn't respect privacy, then the author has a valid reason to cut ties. The friends who say it's okay might not realize the emotional impact. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for standing up for their boundaries, especially in a sensitive situation.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
