It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend posting pictures of the author's messy apartment online after helping clean it up. The author is struggling with depression and had two close friends help clean. The friend in question, their 12-year friend, posted the pictures with jokes about the mess. The author blocked them and is ignoring calls, and others are saying they overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are the author's mental health, the trust issues, and the friend's actions. The author was in a vulnerable state, had a serious problem with depression leading to a messy apartment, and shared this with two close friends who helped clean. The friend who posted the pictures was one of the helpers. The act of posting those images could be seen as a breach of trust, especially since the author was already embarrassed and in a bad mental state. \n\nThe friend's defense might be that they helped clean and thus had a right to post, but the author might see it as a violation of privacy. The other friends think the author is overreacting, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong. The core issue is whether the friend respected the author's privacy and feelings. If the author had trusted the friend not to share those images, especially given the sensitive situation, then the friend's action is a breach. \n\nIn terms of social norms, sharing someone's personal space without consent, especially in a vulnerable state, is generally considered inconsiderate. The friend's jokes on top of that could be adding insult to injury. The author's reaction of blocking and cutting off communication seems justified as a self-preservation act. Others might argue that the friend had a right to share since they helped, but that doesn't override the consent and privacy aspect. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's actions were the breach, and the author has the right to set boundaries and protect their privacy, especially in such a sensitive situation.\n"
