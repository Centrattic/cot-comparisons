It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend posting pictures of the author's messy apartment online, which led the author to end the friendship. \n\nFirst, the author had serious depression leading to a very messy home. They told two close friends about this, who then helped clean. But one of those friends, a 12-year friend, later posted photos of the apartment in a Facebook group with jokes about it being gross. The author blocked them and stopped answering calls, and now others are saying they're overreacting. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, to determine if the author is at fault, I need to analyze the boundaries and the friend's actions. The key points here are privacy, trust, and empathy. The author was in a vulnerable state, sharing their problem with friends who helped them. The friend who posted the photos was part of the cleanup, which shows they were involved in helping. However, sharing private photos without permission, especially when the person is struggling with a serious issue like depression, could be a breach of trust.\n\nThe author's reaction is to end the friendship. Others argue that the friend helped and can post what they want. But the author's privacy and emotional state are important. The friend knew how upset the author was about the apartment being seen, so posting it publicly could be seen as insensitive and violating the trust established during the cleanup. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the friend's action was likely the bigger transgression here. The author had a right to privacy and to not have their personal struggles mocked or shared without consent. Ending the friendship might be a strong reaction, but given the context of mental health and breach of trust, it's understandable. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
