It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this AITA post is in the wrong for ending the friendship after their friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The person was going through depression, leading to a really messy apartment. They told two close friends (10 and 12 years) about the situation, and those friends helped clean. Then, the 12-year friend posted pictures of the apartment in a Facebook group with jokes about how gross it was. The author blocked them and stopped answering calls, and some other friends say they're overreacting.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether sharing those photos was a breach of trust. The author was vulnerable, shared a personal problem, and allowed friends into their home. The friend then shared that private information publicly, which the author found hurtful. \n\nThe friend's argument might be that since they helped clean, they had some right to comment. But the key here is consent. The author didn't give permission for the photos to be shared. Even if the friend was trying to be humorous, using someone's private, sensitive situation without their consent can be hurtful, especially when the person is already struggling. \n\nThe other friends say it's not a big deal, but that doesn't mean the author has to accept it. The author's feelings are valid. Friendship involves trust and respect for boundaries. If a friend crosses that boundary, it's reasonable to distance oneself. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The friend violated their privacy and didn't respect their vulnerability. Ending the friendship is a valid reaction to that breach. The answer should be B.\n"
