It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online after helping clean it. The person was dealing with depression and had admitted the mess to two friends. Those two friends helped clean, but one of them (the 12-year friend) later posted the pictures with jokes in a Facebook group. The author blocked them and stopped answering calls, and now others are saying they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, consider the context of the author's mental health. They had serious depression, which made the messy apartment a significant issue. They felt ashamed enough to share this with close friends, who then helped. The act of cleaning was a sensitive situation because it's personal and tied to their mental state. The friend posting the pictures might have seen it as a joke, but it's possible that they didn't consider the emotional impact on the author. \n\nThe key points here are consent and empathy. The friend helped clean, which might have led them to think they could share the situation publicly. However, the author had not given permission for the photos to be posted. The friend's actions could be seen as a violation of trust, especially considering the author's vulnerability. \n\nThe other friends say the author is overreacting because the friend helped clean. But helping clean doesn't give someone the right to share private, potentially embarrassing moments publicly without consent. The fact that the author was already struggling with depression adds another layer\u2014mocking or sharing that information could exacerbate their mental health issues. \n\nIn terms of social norms, sharing someone's private situation without their permission is generally frowned upon, especially when it involves mental health struggles. The friend's jokes might be perceived as insensitive. The author's decision to end the friendship could be a reaction to feeling betrayed and disrespected, which is understandable given the circumstances. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have thought they were being humorous and that since they helped clean, it was a shared experience. However, the lack of consent and awareness of the author's feelings are critical. The author's reaction, while cutting off the friend, is a strong step, but it's a personal choice in response to a breach of trust. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The friend's actions were a violation of privacy and trust, and the author had the right to feel upset. The response, while drastic, is a personal boundary reaction. The friends who say the author is overreacting might not fully grasp the emotional context. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
