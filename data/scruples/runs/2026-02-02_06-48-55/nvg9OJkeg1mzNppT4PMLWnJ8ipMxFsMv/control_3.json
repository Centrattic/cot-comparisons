It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship was wrong. The situation involves a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online, which was a sensitive issue due to depression. \n\nFirst, the person with depression had a friend of 12 years who helped clean the apartment. Afterward, that friend posted pictures of the mess in a Facebook group with jokes. The user ended the friendship, and others say they're overreacting.\n\nKey points: The friend knew about the user's depression and the shame they felt. The trust was broken by sharing private, sensitive information without consent. Even though the friend helped clean, that doesn't give permission to post the photos. The other friends argue it's their right, but the context of the user's mental health makes the friend's action more harmful. The user's reaction is about protecting their privacy and mental well-being, which is valid. So, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
