It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship after their friend posted pictures of their messy apartment is in the wrong. They've given the situation where the apartment was really messy due to depression, and two friends helped clean. Then a third friend (who had helped) posted the pictures with jokes online, which the author found offensive and ended the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The person who posted the pictures might have thought it was a joke or a way to show they helped. But the original poster was already in a vulnerable state, dealing with depression, and felt ashamed. The key point here is that the friend who posted the pictures knew about the author's feelings about the situation. If they were aware that the author was upset about having the two friends see the apartment, then sharing those images publicly could be seen as violating trust and privacy, even if they had helped clean. \n\nThe author's friends say they're overreacting because the helper had the right to post whatever they wanted. But that argument might not hold if there was a breach of trust. When someone helps in a private, sensitive situation, especially when the person is in a vulnerable mental state, sharing that information without consent can be a serious issue. The friend might have crossed a boundary by making the situation public for humor, which could exacerbate the author's depression or feelings of shame.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might not have realized the impact of their actions. However, given that they knew about the author's distress, they should have been more cautious. The author's decision to end the friendship could be a reaction to feeling disrespected or betrayed. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the friend who posted the pictures likely acted inconsiderately, even if they were trying to be funny. The author's reaction, while a choice, might be justified if they felt the trust was broken. Ending a friendship is a big step, but if the action was a major violation of trust and caused further emotional harm, then the author might not be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the friend didn't intend harm and the author overreacted, then maybe the author is at fault. However, given the context of depression and the breach of privacy, it seems the friend's actions were more offensive. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
