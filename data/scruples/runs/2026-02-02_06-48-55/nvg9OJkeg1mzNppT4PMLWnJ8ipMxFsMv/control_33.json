It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is at fault. The situation involves a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online after helping clean it. The main points are:\n\n1. The person was dealing with depression, leading to a very messy apartment.\n2. Two friends (one of them 12 years) offered help, which they accepted.\n3. After cleaning, the 12-year friend posted pictures and jokes about the mess online.\n4. The user blocked them and cut off contact, leading to others saying they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, privacy is a big factor here. The apartment is a private space, and sharing images without consent is a breach of privacy. Even if the friend helped clean up, that doesn't give them the right to post it publicly. The user was already vulnerable due to depression, so the friend's actions could be seen as insensitive or mocking.\n\nAlso, the friends' initial offer to help was accepted, but the user was uncomfortable. The friend knew this discomfort and then went out of their way to publicize it, which could be hurtful. The fact that others are calling the user overreacting might be because they don't see the context of the depression and the privacy violation.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance. The friend might have thought it was a lighthearted way to talk about the situation, not realizing how serious it was. But intention matters here. If the friend knew the user was upset about others seeing the apartment, then posting it was a betrayal of trust.\n\nSo, the user's reaction is about protecting their privacy and mental health. Ending the friendship might be a strong move, but given the context, it's their right to set boundaries. The friend's actions were wrong regardless of the cleaning help. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
