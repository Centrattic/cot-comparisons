It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after ending a friendship because their friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was dealing with depression, their apartment was a mess, and two friends (one a 12-year friend) helped them clean. Afterward, the 12-year friend posted pictures of the apartment in a Facebook group, making jokes about how gross it was. The author blocked them and is now ignoring their calls. Other friends say the author is overreacting, but the author feels violated because they were already upset about the friends seeing the mess.\n\nSo, the key points here are trust, privacy, and the context of the post. The friend shared private, sensitive information without consent. Even though the friend helped clean, that doesn't necessarily mean they had the right to post pictures. The author was in a vulnerable state, and the friend's actions might have breached that trust.\n\nI should consider whether sharing the photos was a violation of privacy. The author didn't ask the friend to post anything, so the friend overstepped. The friend's jokes about it could be seen as mocking, which adds to the hurt. Even if some people say it's not a big deal, the author's feelings are valid given the context of their mental health struggles.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend thought it was okay since they helped clean. But that's more about their intention rather than the action's impact. The author's reaction is about their boundaries being crossed. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset and cutting off the friend. The friend's actions were inappropriate, so the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
