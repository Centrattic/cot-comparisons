It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend posting pictures of their messy apartment online, which made them feel ashamed. The person had serious depression, the apartment was really bad, and friends helped clean. Then one friend shared photos in a Facebook group with jokes, leading to the author cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a mental health issue, which is a sensitive topic. They were already struggling, and the friend knew about their situation because they had admitted it to two friends, including this one. The friend helped clean, which was a kind gesture, but then posted the pictures without permission. \n\nPrivacy is a big factor here. Sharing someone's home without their consent, especially in a public or semi-public space like a Facebook group, can be invasive. Even if the friend thought it was a joke, the main issue is that the author trusted them and shared their vulnerability. The friend's action might have been meant as a joke, but it crossed a line by violating that trust.\n\nThe other friends say the author is overreacting, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're right. The author has the right to privacy and to ask their friends not to share personal information or images. The fact that the friend was part of the cleaning effort doesn't justify posting without permission. The author's reaction is about the breach of trust, not just the act itself. \n\nDepression can make people more sensitive to judgment and shame. The friend's jokes could have added to the author's distress, making the situation worse. Even if the friend didn't intend harm, the impact is what matters here. Ending the friendship is a strong move, but given the context of mental health and privacy violation, it might be justified.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they had a right to privacy and their feelings were valid given their mental state. The friend's actions, despite helping, breached trust and caused emotional harm.\n"
