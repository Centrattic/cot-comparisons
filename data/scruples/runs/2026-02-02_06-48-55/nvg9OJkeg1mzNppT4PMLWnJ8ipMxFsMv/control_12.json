It was legitimately disgusting, and I\u2019m ashamed to admit how bad it was.  \nAfter admitting how bad the situation was to two of my oldest friends (one friend of 10 years, another friend of 12), they volunteered to help me clean.  Even that was stressful, but they both insisted, so I said okay. \nwe got a lot done, but about a week later, another friend sent me screenshots of a post that the friend of 12 years had posted in a Facebook group- pictures of my apartment, with a ton of jokes about how gross it was. I blocked that friend on Facebook and have now been refusing his calls.  \n\nSome of my other friends are now telling me that I\u2019m over reacting and he can post whatever he wants because he helped clean.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right, because he knew how upset I was about even having the two of them come over and see.  \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ended the friendship is wrong. The situation is that a friend posted pictures of their messy apartment online, which made them feel bad because they were dealing with depression. The friend who posted the pictures had helped clean the apartment, but then shared it in a group with jokes. The question is whether the person is at fault for cutting off that friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy. Sharing someone's private space without permission is a breach of trust. Even if the friend helped clean, posting those pictures without consent is crossing a line. The person might have felt vulnerable, especially during a hard time, so the friend's action could be hurtful.\n\nThe other friends said it's not a big deal because the friend helped clean. But that doesn't justify sharing private photos. Privacy is a personal boundary, and violating it isn't just about the action but also the trust involved. The friend should have respected the person's privacy, especially after being let into their home during a sensitive period.\n\nThe person ending the friendship might be justified. They had a right to feel their privacy was invaded. The friend's behavior showed a lack of respect for their emotional state. The response (blocking, refusing calls) is a way to set boundaries, which is reasonable when trust is broken.\n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The friend's actions were inappropriate, and the author had the right to end the friendship to protect their privacy and emotional well-being.\n"
