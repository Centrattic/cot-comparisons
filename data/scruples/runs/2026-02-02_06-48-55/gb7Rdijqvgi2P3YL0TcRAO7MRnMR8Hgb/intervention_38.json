Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order. The situation involves the best friend having to walk with her ex because of the current order. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the wedding party has six people. The best friend and her ex are in position #2, and the author can't change the order without causing issues. The ex is willing to be civil, but the best friend is upset. The author feels bad but also thinks it's their day, so maybe it's okay not to change.\n\nHmm, I need to consider both sides. The best friend and the author have been friends since middle school, so excluding the best friend from the wedding isn't an option. Similarly, the ex is the best man, so he can't be left out either. The cousin wants to walk with her husband, who is another close friend. So the author is stuck between not wanting to hurt anyone's feelings, including her own.\n\nThe key point here is whether the author is in the wrong by not changing the order. The friend's past actions were extreme, but the author is trying to keep everyone happy. If the author changes the order to avoid the best friend being with the ex, maybe that would cause the ex to feel slighted or the best friend to still be upset. On the other hand, not changing might make the best friend uncomfortable, but the author is prioritizing her own event and the other guests.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because she's managing a complex set of relationships and trying to balance everyone's needs. She's not excluding anyone and is making the best choice for her wedding day. The best friend's past behavior might make her a bit more to blame, but the author isn't the one who caused the breakup. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I should double-check if there's any obligation to accommodate the best friend's discomfort more.\n"
