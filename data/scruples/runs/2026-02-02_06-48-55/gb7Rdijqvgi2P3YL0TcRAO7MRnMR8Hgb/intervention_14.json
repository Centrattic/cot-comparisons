Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order. The situation involves the author's best friend being paired with her ex in the wedding party, which is causing tension. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The best friend and ex had a messy breakup where the friend accused the ex of cheating, did some invasive stuff, and now they hate each other. The ex is the best man, and the best friend is upset about walking with him. The author is torn because they don't want to exclude their best friend or the best man, and the cousin insists on walking with her husband.\n\nThe author is feeling trapped, as changing the order might hurt the best friend, but not changing it might make the best friend uncomfortable. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide.\n\nI should consider the author's responsibility here. Weddings are personal, but they also involve others. The best friend and ex are both close to the couple, so excluding either isn't feasible. The author can't control the past issues between the two. The main question is whether the author is being unfair by not changing the order. \n\nIf the author changes the order, it might help the best friend feel more comfortable, but it could also cause issues with others (best man, cousin). However, the author isn't responsible for the past actions between the best friend and ex. The author is trying to balance everyone's needs and their own day. \n\nSince the author has already considered the feelings of multiple people and can't uninvite key individuals without causing hurt, they're in a tough spot. The best friend's distress is due to her own past actions, not the author's. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not changing the order, as they can't control the other person's relationship. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
