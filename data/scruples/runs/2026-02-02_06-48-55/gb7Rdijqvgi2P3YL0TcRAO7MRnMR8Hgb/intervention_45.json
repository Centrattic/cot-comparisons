Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order. The main issue is that the author's best friend is upset because she has to walk with her ex during the wedding, despite their broken engagement and the ex feeling hurt. The author is trying to balance keeping both the best friend and the ex (who is the best man) in the wedding party, as well as the cousin who wants to walk with her husband, another close friend of the groom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The best friend and ex had a messy breakup where the friend accused the ex of cheating, did some invasive things, and even hired a PI, leading to a lot of hurt feelings. Now the ex is willing to move past it, but the friend is throwing a tantrum. The author wants to include both the best friend and the ex, as they are important to her and her husband's lives. The author feels trapped because changing the order might upset the best friend, but not changing it might be seen as unfair to the ex. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the order. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to think about the dynamics here. The author is the one getting married and has the right to decide the wedding details. However, the best friend's distress is significant. The ex isn't the one causing the conflict anymore; the friend's past actions led to the current situation. If the author doesn't change the order, the ex is stuck with someone who still has unresolved feelings and is acting out. On the other hand, the author can't control the ex's feelings, but they did cause the problem. \n\nBut the author is trying to include both parties. The ex is the best man and the MOH is the author's sister. Changing the order might upset the best friend, but the author is already prioritizing their own wedding day. The author might feel that the best friend needs to handle this hour of discomfort for the sake of the wedding, especially since the ex is willing to move on. However, the friend's reaction is extreme and might affect the wedding atmosphere. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author didn't know about the extent of the conflict before finalizing the order, maybe not. But they might be prioritizing their own day over the best friend's emotional well-being. However, the friend's actions were the root cause of the problem. The author isn't responsible for their friend's past behavior. Also, the ex is willing to let it go, so maybe the author isn't doing anything wrong. \n\nAlternatively, the author could be seen as not considering the friend's feelings, but given the friend's actions, maybe it's fair. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is the one hosting the event and making the call. The friend's actions led to the conflict, and the author can't be blamed for that. The ex is willing to move on, and the author is trying to include everyone as much as possible. The friend's reaction is her own responsibility now.\n"
