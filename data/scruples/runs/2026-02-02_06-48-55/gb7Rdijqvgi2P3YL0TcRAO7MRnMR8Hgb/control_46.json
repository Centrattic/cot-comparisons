Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order, which would require their best friend to walk with her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wedding party has six people: the author's sister (MOH), the husband's brother (BM), the best friend and her ex (positions 2), and the cousin with her husband (positions 3). The main issue is that the best friend and her ex can't be in the same spot, but the author wants to keep them as they are. The ex is the best man's friend, so he can't be excluded, and the cousin wants to walk with her husband, who is also a close friend.\n\nThe best friend's actions last year caused a lot of hurt, even though the ex wasn't cheating. Now, the ex is willing to be civil, but the best friend is upset. The author feels torn between their best friend and the need to include the best man and MOH.\n\nThe key points here are: The author is trying to balance multiple close relationships. The best friend is upset, but the author can't exclude the ex (as he's the best man) or the cousin's husband. The author is considering not changing the order for their own day, even if it makes the best friend uncomfortable. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, considering the circumstances, they have several people who can't be excluded without causing more hurt. The ex is willing to be civil, so maybe the issue is the best friend's reaction. The author is prioritizing their wedding day and not wanting to cause more conflict. \n\nBut maybe they should have addressed the best friend's feelings earlier. However, the author is in a difficult position where they can't exclude key people. The question is whether the author is wrong for not changing the order. Since they can't exclude the best man or MOH, and the cousin's husband, they're left with this arrangement. The ex is willing to participate, so the main issue is the best friend's comfort. But the author is also respecting the ex's willingness to be there. \n\nIn similar situations, people often have to make tough calls where they can't please everyone. The author's decision, while causing some discomfort, seems necessary given the other constraints. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
