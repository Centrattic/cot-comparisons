Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is planning their wedding and has a dilemma about the wedding procession order. Their best friend is upset because she has to walk with her ex, who she had a bad breakup with. The ex isn't cheating, but her actions during the breakup caused a lot of hurt. Now the ex is willing to move past it, but the best friend is throwing a tantrum. The author can't exclude the best man or maid of honor, nor the cousin and her husband (who's also the fianc\u00e9's friend). \n\nThe author is considering not changing the order, making their best friend walk with her ex. They feel bad but also think it's their day. The question is whether they're the asshole if they don't change it.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. The best friend's ex is part of the wedding party (as best man), so they can't just remove him. The cousin wants to walk with her husband, another close friend. The author's best friend is clearly hurt, but the author feels that since it's their wedding day, the friend should just deal with it. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is trying to balance multiple people's feelings. They can't exclude the best man or maid of honor, which are important roles. Their cousin also wants to walk with her husband. The author is in a tough spot because they don't want to exclude their best friend either. \n\nBut the friend is being unreasonable. The ex is willing to attend and move past the issues. The author isn't forcing the friend to interact with the ex beyond the procession. If the friend can avoid speaking to him afterward, maybe that's manageable. The author is prioritizing their own wedding day experience and the inclusion of important family and friends. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a way to adjust the order without major conflict. But the author mentions that the cousin insists on walking with her husband, and the best friend's ex is already in a key position. Changing the order might not be feasible without causing more hurt. \n\nGiven that the author is trying to include as many people as possible without causing major rifts, it's a tough call. The friend's reaction is extreme, and the author might feel that it's their day to enjoy. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They can't control everyone's past, and they're making the best of a bad situation. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They're trying to balance multiple people's needs and can't exclude important people. The friend's reaction is more about her past issues, not the author's current actions.\n"
