Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order. The best friend and her ex are both in the wedding party, and they have a major conflict. The best friend is upset because she and her ex can't be together, but the author wants to keep the order as is.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author's best friend and her ex were engaged but broke up due to accusations of cheating (which turned out to be false). Now, they despise each other. The ex is the best man and the author's sister is the maid of honor. The best friend is supposed to walk with her ex in the procession. The cousin wants to walk with her husband, who's a friend of the author's fianc\u00e9. \n\nThe author is caught between keeping their best friend in the wedding and not wanting to cause more conflict. The question is whether the author is wrong for not changing the order. \n\nWeddings are a big deal, and the procession order is usually a tradition that's followed. However, in this case, the order is causing emotional stress. The author has six people in the wedding party, and the current setup is sister, best friend + ex, cousin + husband. The best friend is throwing a tantrum about walking with her ex. \n\nThe key points here: The author's best friend and ex can't be in the same group without causing issues, but changing the order might upset the best man and the maid of honor. The author is considering not changing it, prioritizing their own day and the possibility of avoiding a larger conflict. \n\nTraditional procession order is about hierarchy, but the author has to balance their own event with the feelings of their friend. The ex is willing to move past it, but the best friend isn't. The author is worried about the friend's feelings but also doesn't want to exclude the best man. \n\nIf the author changes the order, maybe the best friend can walk with someone else, but does that cause more hurt to the best man and maid of honor? The cousin's husband is a friend, but he's part of the wedding party. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's their day, and the best friend should just handle the hour of being with her ex. But that could be seen as insensitive, as the friend is clearly upset. However, the author also can't uninvite the best man and maid of honor because that would hurt others. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's well-being is important, but the author's own event is also significant. The friend is the one who is throwing a tantrum, which might indicate that she's the one being difficult. The ex is willing to move on, but the friend isn't. The author is trying to keep everyone in the wedding. \n\nMaybe the answer is B (No), because the author is trying to accommodate both their best friend and the best man, who are both important. The friend's reaction is extreme, and the author is balancing their own event with the expectations of others. However, making the best friend walk with her ex could cause more harm. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author doesn't change the order, they might be causing discomfort to their best friend. However, they might not be in the wrong if they can't exclude the best man. The friend's own behavior is contentious, so maybe the author isn't the asshole here. The answer is B.\n"
