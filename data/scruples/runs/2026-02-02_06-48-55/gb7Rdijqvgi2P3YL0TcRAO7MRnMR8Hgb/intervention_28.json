Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order so that their best friend doesn't have to walk with her ex. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's best friend and her ex are both in the wedding party because the ex is the best man (husband's brother) and the best friend is in the wedding party. The ex is willing to move on, but the best friend is upset. The author wants to include both the best friend and the best man without causing more conflict. The cousin and her husband are also in the procession, and the cousin insists on walking with her husband. The author feels bad for the best friend but also thinks it's their day and the friend should just deal with it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let's consider the perspectives. The best friend and ex have a toxic history where the friend did harmful things, leading to their breakup. The ex is moving on, but the friend is still angry. The author is trying to balance their own wedding with maintaining relationships with both the best friend and the best man (husband's brother). The cousin's insistence adds another layer because the husband is a friend of the fianc\u00e9.\n\nIs it fair to ask the best friend to be near her ex for a short time? The author is not forcing them to interact beyond the procession. The wedding is a big event, and the author might feel that the friend should manage her feelings. But the friend has been a lifelong friend, and the author doesn't want to exclude her. The author is caught between two important relationships.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They can't exclude the best man or the best friend. The wedding procession is a small part of the event. The author isn't making them interact beyond that. The friend's reaction is her own issue, and the author isn't responsible for their past actions. Plus, they've been friends since middle school, so the author's loyalty is there. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
