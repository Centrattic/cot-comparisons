Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order, which would make their best friend walk with her ex. The background is that the best friend and ex had a bad breakup, with the friend acting out by invading the ex's privacy, leading to mutual dislike. Now, the ex is the groom's best man, and the author doesn't want to upset their sister (the maid of honor) or cousin, who insists on walking with her husband.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The best friend is upset and throwing a tantrum, but the author is also trying to keep their wedding party intact. The author is torn between their best friend's feelings and the commitments they've made to others. The question is whether not changing the order makes the author the asshole.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's their day, and the friend should just endure the hour. But the friend's situation is complicated\u2014she already caused issues by cheating on the ex, even if he wasn't actually cheating. However, the ex is now in the wedding party, and the author can't exclude him. \n\nI think the author is in a tough spot because they can't exclude the best man or maid of honor without causing hurt feelings. The cousin's husband is also part of the wedding party, so they can't avoid that either. The author is trying to balance multiple relationships. The best friend's reaction is a problem, but the author can't control that. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Maybe not. They can't force the ex to leave the wedding party or the cousin to not walk with her husband. The author is prioritizing their own wedding day and maintaining the existing relationships. The friend's actions were extreme, but the author isn't responsible for the past. They\u2019re making a choice based on the current constraints. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a more ethical angle I'm missing. Maybe the author could find a workaround, but they haven't mentioned any. Given the situation, it's a tough call, but the answer might be B.\n"
