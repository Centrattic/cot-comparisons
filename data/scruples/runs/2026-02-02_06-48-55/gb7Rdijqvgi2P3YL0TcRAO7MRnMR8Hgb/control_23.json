Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order so that the best friend doesn't have to walk with her ex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wedding party has six people. The setup is: sister as Maid of Honor (MOH), husband's brother as Best Man (BM), best friend and her ex are number 2, then cousin and her husband are number 3. The problem is the best friend and her ex can't be in the same group anymore because of a past conflict. The ex's presence is necessary because he's the best man's friend, and the cousin insists on walking with her husband, who is the fianc\u00e9's friend. The author is considering not changing the order, making the best friend walk with her ex for the procession, even though they despise each other now.\n\nThe ex wasn't cheating, but the friend's actions (like checking his phone, PI, etc.) caused hurt. Now, the ex is willing to move on, but the friend is upset. The author is torn between not wanting to exclude the best friend (who's been a lifelong friend) and the fact that the ex can't be excluded either. The author feels it's their day and maybe the friend should just deal with it for an hour.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by not changing the order. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nIn the WIBTA (Would I Be a Twat) format, the community often considers intent, fairness, and the impact on others. The key points here are:\n\n1. The author is trying to balance multiple relationships. They can't exclude the best friend or the best man without causing hurt feelings. The cousin's husband is also part of the wedding party because of their friend group.\n\n2. The ex is willing to move past the conflict, but the friend is not. The author doesn't want to exclude the friend, so they're choosing to keep the original order. The author feels it's their day and the friend should just handle it for the hour.\n\n3. The friend's actions were extreme in the past. She went through his devices, hired a PI, etc., which led to the breakup. Even though he wasn't cheating, her actions caused the split. Now they despise each other.\n\n4. The author is in a difficult position, trying to include everyone important. The friend is a lifelong friend, and the ex is the best man's friend. The cousin's husband is also part of the fianc\u00e9's friend group.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is prioritizing their own wedding day and the people they feel they can't exclude. However, making the friend walk with someone she despises could be hurtful. But the author is also considering that the ex is willing to move on and that the friend is throwing a tantrum. The author is torn between two important relationships.\n\nIn WIBTA scenarios, the community often looks at whether someone is being unreasonable. The author is trying to manage their event and can't exclude people without causing greater hurt. The ex is part of the best man's group, which is essential. The cousin's husband is part of the fianc\u00e9's group, so the cousin wants to walk with him. The author can't rearrange the order without excluding someone important. \n\nGiven that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they can't exclude people without causing more issues. The friend's reaction is extreme, and the author is trying to include her despite the situation. The ex is willing to put the past behind, so the author's choice might be justified. However, there's a consideration of the friend's feelings. But since the friend's actions led to the breakup, the author might be reasonable in not changing the order. \n\nFinal answer: B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
