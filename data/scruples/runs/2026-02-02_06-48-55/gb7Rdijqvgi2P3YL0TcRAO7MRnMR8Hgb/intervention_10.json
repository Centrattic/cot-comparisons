Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is about a wedding procession order. The main issue is that the author's best friend is upset because she has to walk with her ex in the wedding party. The ex was previously engaged to the friend but there were some issues that led to a breakup. Now, the ex is the best man, and the author can't change the order because of other commitments, like the maid of honor being her sister and the best man being her husband's brother. The cousin also insists on walking with her husband, who is another friend. The author is torn between not wanting to upset the best friend and feeling it's her day to handle things as she sees fit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The best friend and her ex have a complicated history. The ex was involved in cheating accusations, which led to the breakup. Now, the ex is part of the wedding party as the best man, which is a close role. The author is friends with the best friend since middle school and doesn't want to exclude her. The husband's best friend (the ex) can't be excluded either, and the cousin's husband is part of another couple in the wedding party.\n\nThe author is asking if she's the asshole for not changing the procession order. The key points here are: the author is caught between two important people (best friend and husband's best man) who can't be excluded without causing hurt feelings. The best friend is upset about having to walk with her ex, but the author feels it's her day and the best friend should just handle the hour they're together.\n\nFrom a relational standpoint, the author has a long-standing friendship with the best friend. It's understandable that she wouldn't want to exclude her. However, the ex is a close friend of the husband, so excluding him could cause issues with the husband's family or friends. The cousin's insistence adds another layer, complicating the order further.\n\nThe author's main dilemma is whether she's being reasonable in maintaining the current order. The question is if she's in the wrong. The key here is whether the author has a responsibility to accommodate the best friend's discomfort. The best friend's ex is part of the wedding party, so there's a reason he's included (as the best man). The author might not be in the wrong because she's trying to balance multiple relationships and the wedding is her event. However, the best friend's emotional well-being is also important. If the author had known the history beforehand, maybe she could have adjusted the order to avoid this situation, but now she's stuck. \n\nConsidering that the ex is the best man and the author's husband's brother, it's clear that he's an important part of the wedding party. The author might not be in the wrong because she's respecting both her husband's family and her best friend, even if it's a difficult situation. The best friend might need to handle her feelings in this moment, even if it's uncomfortable. However, the author could be considered not in the wrong because she's making the best decision given the constraints. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's balancing multiple important relationships and it's her day to prioritize.\n"
