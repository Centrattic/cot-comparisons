Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order. The best friend is upset because she has to walk with her ex during the wedding, even though they're no longer together. The ex is the best man, and the author can't uninvite him because he's the husband's best friend. The best friend is being difficult, and the author is torn between her feelings for the best friend and wanting to keep the wedding peaceful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationships involved. The author's best friend and ex are now hostile, but the ex is part of the wedding party. The author wants to include both the best friend and the ex, which is causing conflict. The best friend is acting out, maybe because she's hurt or still has feelings. The ex is willing to move on for the wedding, but the best friend isn't.\n\nThe author is feeling bad but also thinks it's their day. They're considering not changing the order, which would mean the best friend has to be with her ex for a short time. The question is whether that makes the author the asshole.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to balance multiple relationships and keep everyone included. Weddings are stressful, and it's hard to make everyone happy. On the other hand, maybe the author should have anticipated this issue and tried to find a different arrangement. But given the constraints\u2014can't uninvite the best man or maid of honor, cousin insists on walking with her husband\u2014it's a tight situation.\n\nThe key points are that the author is including both the best friend and ex despite the conflict. The ex is willing to put the past behind, but the best friend is resistant. The author is trying to be fair but is stuck. Since the wedding is their day, maybe they aren't in the wrong for not changing the order, especially if they can't change the other parts of the wedding party. The best friend's reaction is her own choice, and the author is doing their best to include everyone possible without causing more hurt.\n"
