Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order, which would require the best friend to walk with her ex. The background is that the best friend and her ex had a bad breakup where she accused him of cheating and did some intense things like hiring a PI. They're done, but the ex is still in the wedding as the best man, and the best friend is upset about having to walk with him. The author is stuck because both the best friend and the ex can't be excluded without causing hurt feelings, and the cousin wants to walk with her husband, another friend.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is wrong for not changing the order. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if others agree. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wedding is a big day, and the author is trying to manage multiple relationships. The best friend and ex are both in the wedding party, but the friend is upset about having to be near the ex. The author is caught between not wanting to exclude the best friend and the ex (since he's the best man and husband's friend) and the cousin's insistence to walk with her husband.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to include all important people in their wedding, which is understandable. It's their day, and having key people like the best man and maid of honor is traditional. On the other hand, the best friend is in a lot of emotional distress over this. The author is making a choice that prioritizes the wedding party structure and other family members over their best friend's discomfort. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, maybe not entirely. They can't necessarily exclude someone just because of a past relationship, especially if the ex is part of the wedding party. The author might not have a legal or moral obligation to change the order. However, the friend's distress is real. The author is aware that this is causing emotional pain but is choosing to proceed. The question is whether that makes them the asshole. \n\nThe friend has been a lifelong friend, so her feelings matter. The author is making a choice that causes her discomfort, even if it's for the sake of the wedding. But the author is also trying to balance multiple relationships. It's a tough spot. Some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they can't control the past situation or the ex's presence. Others might say they should be more considerate of the friend's feelings. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is actively causing harm beyond just the discomfort. The friend is \"throwing a major tantrum,\" which might indicate she's overreacting. The author might feel justified in not changing the order since it's their wedding and the ex is part of the wedding party. However, if there's a feasible way to adjust the order without major issues, maybe the author should consider that. But since they've tried and can't change it without excluding others, perhaps it's not their fault. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're in a tough spot and trying to include everyone, even though it's causing some discomfort. The main issue is that they can't exclude people, so they're not wrong for not changing the order.\n"
