Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order so that their best friend doesn't have to walk with her ex. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the wedding party setup: 6 people. The author's sister is the maid of honor (MOH), the husband's brother is the best man (BM). The best friend and her ex are number 2 in the procession. Then the cousin and her husband are number 3. \n\nThe background story: The best friend and ex were engaged, but the friend accused him of cheating, did some intense investigating, which turned out to be baseless. Now they despise each other. The ex is willing to move past it for the wedding, but the friend is throwing a tantrum. The author wants their best friend in the wedding, and the ex can't be excluded because he's the best man. The cousin also insists on walking with her husband, who's a close friend. The author is conflicted because they don't want their best friend to have to be near her ex during the procession, but they feel it's their day and maybe the friend should just handle it.\n\nThe author is considering not changing the order. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if that's the case.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, the author is trying to balance their relationships with the best friend and the best man (husband's brother), as well as the cousin. The best friend's actions led to the breakup, but the author is in a tough spot. The key question is whether the author is wrong for prioritizing their wedding day and the inclusion of the best man (who is their husband's best friend) over their best friend's emotional comfort.\n\nIn most discussions about weddings, it's considered the couple's day, and they have the right to make decisions that prioritize their own comfort and the inclusion of family and close friends. However, the best friend is a close friend, and the author is concerned about her feelings. But the ex is the best man, so he's part of the wedding party through the husband's family. The cousin's inclusion is also non-negotiable because of their relationship.\n\nThe author is not excluding anyone; they're arranging the procession order. The best friend's reaction is a result of her past actions and current feelings. The author can't be expected to change the order just to accommodate the best friend's discomfort, especially since the ex is part of the wedding party. The author is not the one who caused the breakup; the best friend's actions led to the breakup. So, the author isn't at fault here. They're trying to include both the best friend and the best man, even though it's a difficult situation for the friend. It's a complex situation, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not changing the order because they can't control the ex's presence in the wedding party. The best friend might need to find a way to handle this part of the day, even if it's hard.\n"
