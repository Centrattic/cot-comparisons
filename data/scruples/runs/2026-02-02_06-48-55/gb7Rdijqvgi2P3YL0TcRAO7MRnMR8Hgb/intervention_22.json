Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order, which would require the best friend to walk with her ex. The situation involves a lot of personal relationships and past conflicts.\n\nFirst, the author has a best friend who had a messy breakup with her ex. The friend accused the ex of cheating, did some extreme things like hiring a private investigator, and now they despise each other. The ex is the author's husband's best friend, so he's in the wedding party. The cousin wants to walk with her husband, who is also the fianc\u00e9's close friend. \n\nThe author is caught between not wanting to exclude the best friend (who's been a lifelong friend) and the husband's brother (best man) and cousin (walking with husband). The friend is upset about having to walk with her ex during the procession, even for an hour. The author feels bad but also thinks it's their day and the friend should handle it.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the author's wedding day, the importance of the friend in their life, the ex's role as the best man, and the cousin's request. The friend's actions in the past were extreme and caused a lot of hurt, leading to mutual dislike. The ex is willing to let it go for the wedding, but the friend is throwing a tantrum.\n\nIf the author changes the order, maybe the best friend could walk with someone else. But changing the order might mean moving people around, which could upset others. The author is trying to balance everyone's feelings. The friend's reaction is causing stress, and the author is feeling trapped. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is prioritizing their wedding day and the inclusion of key people (husband's brother, cousin) who are significant in their life. The friend, while important, is in a situation where her past actions led to the conflict. The author isn't forcing the friend and ex to interact beyond the procession, so maybe it's manageable. The ex is willing to tolerate it, and the author might feel it's reasonable to ask the friend to handle this hour of the ceremony. However, if the friend is truly distressed and the author could find a solution without major changes, maybe they should adjust. But given the constraints (can't remove the best man or MOH, cousin insists on walking with her husband), changing the order might not be feasible. \n\nSo, considering the author's perspective and the constraints, they might not be in the wrong for not changing the order. They're trying to include everyone important while managing a difficult situation. However, some might argue that the friend's emotional well-being is important too. But since the author is the one getting married, their priorities could take precedence. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
