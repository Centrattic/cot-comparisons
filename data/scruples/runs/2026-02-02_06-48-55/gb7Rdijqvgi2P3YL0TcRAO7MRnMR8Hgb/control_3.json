Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is whether they should change the wedding procession order so their best friend doesn't have to walk with her ex. The background is that the best friend and her ex had a messy breakup where she accused him of cheating, did some intense things like hiring a PI, and now they hate each other. The ex is the best man, and the best friend is upset about having to be near him during the ceremony.\n\nFirst, the author is caught between their best friend and their husband's brother. They don't want to hurt their best friend but also can't exclude the best man. The cousin is also part of the mix, but that seems less relevant to the main issue. The key points are the conflicting loyalties and the stress on the best friend.\n\nOn one hand, the author is getting married and wants their day to go smoothly. They might feel that the best friend should just endure an hour of being near her ex. On the other hand, the best friend is their lifelong friend, and putting her through that might be really hurtful. The author is in a tough spot because they can't exclude key people without causing other issues.\n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong for not changing the order. The ex is the best man, so he has to be there. The author isn't the one who caused the conflict between the best friend and her ex. The fault there lies with the best friend's past actions. The author is trying to manage the aftermath of that. They\u2019re not forcing her to interact beyond the procession; it's more about standing next to him during the ceremony. \n\nIf the author changes the order, maybe they can avoid the best friend having to stand with her ex. But changing the order might not be a big deal. However, the author might think that changing the order would cause more problems or hurt other people. They\u2019re also considering their cousin's husband, who's part of the wedding party. So there might be logistical issues in rearranging.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author is at fault. They\u2019re trying to honor their husband's family and their own cousin while keeping their best friend involved. The ex's presence is necessary, and the author isn't the one who caused the rift. Therefore, not changing the order isn't their fault. They\u2019re managing a difficult situation where they can't please everyone. The answer is probably B, they\u2019re not in the wrong.\n"
