Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order, which would mean their best friend has to walk with her ex. The key points here are the relationships involved and the potential hurt feelings.\n\nFirst, the best friend and her ex are engaged but had a falling out. She accused him of cheating, which led to a lot of conflict, even though he wasn't actually cheating. Now they despise each other. She's upset about having to be near him during the wedding, while the ex is willing to move past it. The author is caught between not wanting to exclude their best friend and their husband's best man (the ex) also needing to be in the wedding. Plus, the cousin insists on walking with her husband, another close friend of the groom.\n\nThe author is feeling torn, wanting to protect their best friend but also considering that it's their wedding day. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the order. \n\nLooking at the situation, the author is trying to balance multiple important relationships. They can't exclude the best man or the maid of honor without causing hurt feelings. The cousin's insistence adds another layer. The author is considering the best friend's feelings but also their own right to have their wedding day proceed as planned. The ex is willing to put the past aside, which might mitigate some tension. The best friend's reaction could be a significant issue, but the author is already aware of the potential fallout and is conflicted. \n\nIn terms of who's at fault, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own wedding day logistics and relationships. However, not addressing the best friend's distress could be seen as inconsiderate. But given the constraints (can't remove the best man, the cousin's demands), the author is in a difficult position. The ex's willingness to move past the conflict might help, but the best friend's anger is a valid concern. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't the asshole for not changing the order because they're managing multiple important relationships and trying to ensure their wedding goes smoothly. The best friend's overreaction might be her own issue to handle, and the author has made compromises already by including both the best friend and the ex despite the tension. So, the answer is B.\n"
