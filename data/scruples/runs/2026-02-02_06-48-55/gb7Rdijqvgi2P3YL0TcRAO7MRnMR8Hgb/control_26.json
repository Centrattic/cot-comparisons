Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order, which would mean their best friend has to walk with her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's best friend and her ex are still in a strained relationship because the ex was accused of cheating, which wasn't true, but the friend's actions (like hiring a PI) caused hurt. Now the ex is being respectful for the wedding, but the friend is upset. The wedding party includes the ex (as best man) and the author's sister (as maid of honor), and cousin with her husband. The author is considering not changing the order, making the friend walk with her ex.\n\nThe key points here are the relationships involved. The best friend is important to the author, but the ex is also part of the wedding party. The author feels conflicted but wants to keep their day as is. \n\nI should consider whether it's fair to the best friend to have to be near her ex. The friend is throwing a tantrum, which might be over the top, but the author is trying to balance multiple important relationships. The ex is willing to put aside feelings, so maybe the problem is more on the friend's side. \n\nThe author isn't in a position where they can exclude the best man or maid of honor without causing hurt. Also, the cousin insists on walking with her husband, so that's another fixed point. \n\nIs it the author's fault for not changing the order? Well, the author is trying to include everyone important. The friend's reaction is part of her own issues from the past. The author isn't forcing them to interact beyond the procession. The hour they have to be together is a small part of the day. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong. They can't control the friend's emotions fully, and they're prioritizing multiple important people. Answer B.\n"
