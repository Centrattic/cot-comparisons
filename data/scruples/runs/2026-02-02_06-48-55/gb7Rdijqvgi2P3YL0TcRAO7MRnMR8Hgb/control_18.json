Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole for not changing the wedding procession order, which would require their best friend to walk with her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wedding party has six people. The best friend and her ex are second in the procession, so they'd be walking together. The ex is the best man, and the best friend is the maid of honor's sister or something? Wait, the MOH is the author's sister. The best friend and her ex broke up because the friend accused him of cheating, did a bunch of stuff, and now they hate each other. The ex is willing to move on for the wedding, but the best friend is throwing a tantrum. \n\nThe author doesn't want to exclude the best friend because they've been friends since middle school. The ex is the husband's best friend, so can't just not be there. The cousin wants to walk with her husband, who is also a friend. The author feels stuck because they don't want to hurt the best friend but also think it's their day.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for not changing the order. The key points here are the author's responsibility to their friends and family. The author is trying to balance multiple relationships here. The best friend is upset, but the ex is also a key part of the wedding (as best man). Changing the order might cause more issues. The author is considering their own comfort and the importance of the wedding day. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they can't exclude the best friend because of their own feelings of guilt. But they also can't exclude the ex, who's a close friend of the husband. The author is trying to keep everyone included. The best friend's reaction is extreme, but the author isn't the one who caused the breakup. The situation is complicated, and the author is making a call based on their relationships and the importance of the day. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're trying to manage a difficult situation with multiple people they care about. It's not their fault the best friend is having a hard time, and they have rights to their own wedding day. The ex is willing to be civil, even if the best friend isn't. The author isn't the asshole here.\n"
