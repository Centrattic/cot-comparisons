Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (WIBTA) is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order, which would require the best friend to walk with her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wedding party has six people. The author's sister is the maid of honor (MOH), the husband's brother is the best man (BM). The next two are the best friend and her ex, then the cousin and her husband. \n\nThe background is that the best friend and her ex had a complicated engagement where the friend accused the ex of cheating, did some invasive things like checking his devices and hiring a PI. It turned out he wasn't cheating, but the friend's actions caused a lot of hurt, leading to a breakup and mutual dislike. Now, the ex is willing to put it aside for the wedding, but the best friend is upset. \n\nThe author feels torn because they don't want to exclude their best friend or the best man (the ex) since they're both important. The cousin also insists on walking with her husband, who's a friend of the groom. The author is considering whether it's okay not to change the order, making the friend walk with her ex for an hour during the ceremony.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the order. \n\nLet me break down the factors. The author is prioritizing their wedding day, where they're including key people (sister, brother-in-law, cousin, and the best friend and her ex). The best friend is upset but the author can't exclude the ex (best man) or the cousin's husband. The author is caught between their friend's feelings and the necessity of including important family and friends. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't forcing the ex to attend or walk with the friend. The ex is willing to be gracious. The friend is the one resisting the arrangement. The author has to manage multiple relationships here\u2014family, close friends, and their spouses. \n\nConsidering that weddings are personal events, the author might feel they have the right to decide the order. However, the friend is their close friend, and the author might be causing some emotional distress by keeping the current order. But the author also can't exclude the ex (best man), so they're not directly responsible for the conflict between the two. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being unfair. They're trying to balance all relationships. The friend's reaction is her own, and the author is including her in the wedding despite the situation. The author isn't making the ex attend or walk with her; it's more about the procession order. So, if the author had the option to adjust the order to avoid the friend walking with the ex, but chooses not to because they can't exclude others, it's their decision. \n\nI think the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to include everyone important and the conflict is between the friend and ex, not the author's fault. The author is managing a complex set of relationships and making a decision that affects their own wedding's logistics.\n"
