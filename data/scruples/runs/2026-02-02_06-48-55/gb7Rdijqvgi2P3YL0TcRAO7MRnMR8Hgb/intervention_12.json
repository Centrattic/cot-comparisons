Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order, which would mean the best friend has to walk with her ex. The background is that the best friend and ex had a messy breakup, with the friend doing some extreme things like hiring a PI and checking his devices. The ex isn't cheating, but the friend's actions caused a rift. The ex is willing to move on for the wedding, but the friend is upset. The author is caught between keeping their best friend in the wedding and their husband's best man.\n\nSo, the author wants to know if they're the asshole if they don't switch the order. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is their wedding day and keeping their close friends and family involved. The best friend is crucial, and the ex is the best man. The cousin also wants to walk with her husband, another friend. The author feels the best friend should just handle the hour with the ex and then not have to deal with him again. \n\nThe key points here are the author's relationships and their obligations. The best friend is a major part of their life, but the husband's side is also important. The author isn't directly causing the conflict; the conflict is from the past breakup. The author is trying to balance their day without causing more hurt, especially since the ex is willing to be civil. The author's decision might be seen as prioritizing their own event and the people they can't exclude. \n\nThe best friend's reaction is a problem, but the author isn't the one who caused the breakup. They're trying to include everyone. It's their day, and they're making choices that affect their event. Since the ex is willing to put it aside, it's reasonable for the author not to change the order, even if the best friend is upset. The author isn't forcing the best friend to interact beyond the procession. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They're making the best of a difficult situation. The answer might be B (not in the wrong). But need to check if there's any other angle. Could the author be expected to accommodate the best friend more? Maybe, but they can't exclude the best man either. It's a tough spot. The answer is B.\n"
