Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order, which means their best friend has to walk with her ex. The background is that the best friend and ex had a messy breakup where she accused him of cheating and did some extreme things, even though he wasn't cheating. Now, they despise each other.\n\nThe author is getting married in May and has a six-person wedding party. They can't exclude the best friend or the ex because they're both important\u2014best friend is a key person, and the ex is the best man. The cousin also wants to walk with her husband, who's a close friend. The author feels bad but also thinks it's their day and the friend should just deal with it for an hour.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's accurate. So, I need to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, the author is in a tough spot. They can't exclude the best friend or the best man without causing hurt feelings. The best friend is throwing a tantrum over having to walk with her ex, but the author feels it's their day. But the friend's actions were extreme, leading to a breakup, and now she's upset about having to be near him during the wedding. \n\nIs the author wrong for not changing the order? Well, the author is trying to include everyone important. They can't exclude either person. Maybe the problem is that the friend's ex is the best man, which makes their proximity inevitable. The author is prioritizing the wedding day and including all key people, even if it's uncomfortable. However, considering the friend's past behavior and current distress, maybe the author should have found a way to adjust the order to avoid the discomfort. But given that they can't exclude anyone, perhaps they're not at fault. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have communicated better or found a compromise. But the friend's actions were extreme, and the ex is part of the husband's close circle. The author is balancing multiple important relationships. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. The author isn't excluding anyone; they're just maintaining the order. The friend's reaction might be a bigger issue, but the author is caught in the middle. So maybe the answer is B (not wrong) because they can't exclude people and it's their day. The friend's actions leading to the breakup were her own, so she might need to handle this part. But the author's empathy is there, feeling bad for the friend. However, they're not the ones causing the conflict; they're just managing their wedding day. So B seems more likely.\n"
