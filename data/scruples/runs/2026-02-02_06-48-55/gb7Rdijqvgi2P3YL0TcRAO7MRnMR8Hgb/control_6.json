Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order. The situation is that the best friend is upset about having to walk with her ex during the wedding, but the author feels it's their day and the friend should just deal with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author has a close relationship with the best friend since middle school, so it's important to her. The ex is the best man's husband, so they can't exclude him. The friend's ex is willing to move on, but the friend is throwing a tantrum. The author is torn between her friend's feelings and her own wedding day.\n\nI should think about whether the author is obligated to change the order. The wedding is the author's event, so she has some say over the details. However, the friend is close and has a valid reason to be upset given the past conflict. But the ex isn't the one being hostile; the friend is the one with the beef. The ex even seems willing to be civil. \n\nAlso, the other people in the wedding party, like the cousin and her husband, are part of the setup. There's a limited number of people in the party, so maybe changing the order isn't feasible without causing other issues. The author might not be the one wrong here because she's trying to balance everyone's feelings. The friend might be overreacting, especially since the ex wasn't at fault. \n\nIn terms of social norms, weddings are personal, and the bride and groom have the final say. The friend's reaction might be unreasonable, especially if the ex is willing to be there. The author isn't forcing them to interact beyond the procession, and the friend's presence is important to the author. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not changing the order. The answer is likely B.\n"
