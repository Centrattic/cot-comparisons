Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order so that their best friend doesn't have to walk with her ex. The main issue is the conflict between the best friend and her ex, which was caused by her actions like hiring a PI and invading his privacy, even though he wasn't cheating. Now the ex is willing to move on for the wedding, but the best friend is throwing a tantrum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities of the wedding planner. The author is trying to balance multiple relationships: their best friend, their husband's best man, their cousin, etc. They mention that the husband's best friend (the ex) can't be excluded because that would hurt feelings. The cousin insists on walking with her husband, who is also the fianc\u00e9's friend. The author feels bad for the best friend but also sees this as their day.\n\nThe key points here are the existing rift caused by the best friend's own actions. She went through his phone, hired a PI, etc., leading to their breakup. Now she's upset about having to be near him during the wedding. The author is caught between including the best friend and the husband's best man. \n\nIs it fair for the author to prioritize their wedding day over the best friend's discomfort? The author has already made a decision that the husband's best friend must be in the wedding, which is reasonable. The procession order is a logistical detail that might not require changing unless there's a significant reason. The best friend's actions led to the problem, so expecting the author to rearrange the order to accommodate her might be unreasonable. \n\nThe author also mentions that the ex is willing to move past this. The best friend's reaction seems to be about her own unresolved feelings. The author isn't causing the conflict; they're dealing with the aftermath of the best friend's previous actions. So, if the author doesn't change the order, they're not necessarily the asshole. They're making a call to maintain their wedding's integrity and include both important people.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
