Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing their wedding procession order, which would require their best friend to walk with her ex. The background is that the best friend and ex had a messy breakup where the friend did some extreme things like hiring a PI, which caused a lot of hurt. Now, the ex is willing to move on, but the friend is throwing a tantrum. The author feels bad but also thinks it's their day and doesn't want to change the order. They can't exclude the best man (ex) or the MOH (his sister) because that would hurt their feelings. The cousin also wants to walk with her husband, who is a close friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is being unreasonable. The friend's actions during the breakup were extreme, but the author has maintained a lifelong friendship. The ex is the husband's best friend, so excluding him isn't an option. The author is caught between their friend's feelings and their wedding day. The key points are: the author isn't forcing the friend to interact beyond the procession, the ex isn't causing trouble, and the friend is the one being difficult. The author is prioritizing their day and not making the ex friend walk with someone else might be seen as fair. Also, the friend's actions were her own, so the author isn't responsible for that. The answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
