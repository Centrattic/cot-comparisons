Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order where their best friend has to walk with her ex. The best friend and ex broke up because she accused him of cheating, even though he wasn't. Now they despise each other. The author wants her best friend in the wedding and can't leave out the ex because he's the best man. The cousin also has to walk with her husband, another friend.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is wrong for keeping the current order. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a tough spot. They can't exclude the best man (husband's best friend) or the maid of honor (sister), and the cousin is insistent. The best friend is upset but the author is conflicted. The author is trying to balance multiple relationships. \n\nIs the author at fault for not changing the order? Well, the ex is part of the wedding party as the best man, so it's expected he's there. The best friend is in a bad situation, but the author is prioritizing their own wedding day and the other commitments. The author is also trying to include their best friend. \n\nThe ex and best friend have a history of a very toxic breakup, but the ex is willing to attend. The best friend is throwing a tantrum. The author is feeling trapped but is trying to manage everyone's feelings. \n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they can't exclude someone who's a key part of the wedding. The author is trying to be inclusive, even if it's causing some discomfort. However, maybe the author could have found another way to arrange the procession to minimize the interaction. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not if they should have done something else. \n\nConsidering the options, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is in a situation where they can't exclude people who are important to the wedding. The author is making a difficult choice to prioritize the day's flow and other relationships, not intentionally being cruel. The best friend's reaction is extreme, which complicates things further. So the author isn't necessarily the asshole here."
