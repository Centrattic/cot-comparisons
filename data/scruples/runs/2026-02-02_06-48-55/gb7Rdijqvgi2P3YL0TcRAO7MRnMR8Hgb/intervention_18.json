Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person planning the wedding) is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order so that the best friend doesn't have to walk with her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wedding party has six people: the author's sister is the maid of honor (MOH), the husband's brother is the best man (BM), the best friend and her ex are second in line, and the cousin and her husband are third. The problem is that the best friend and her ex had a messy breakup where she accused him of cheating, did some extreme things, and now they can't stand each other. The ex is the husband's best friend, so he can't be excluded. The best friend is throwing a tantrum about walking with the ex. The author is torn between not wanting to hurt the best friend and feeling that the wedding is their day.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let's break it down. The author is including both the best friend and the ex because they are important people in their and their partner's lives. The best friend has been a lifelong friend, and the ex is the husband's best friend. The cousin also wants to walk with her husband, another close friend. \n\nThe question is about whether it's wrong to not change the order. The author is trying to balance multiple important relationships without causing more hurt. The best friend is upset, but the author can't exclude either person. The author is feeling trapped, trying to make a decision that affects their day. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? The author isn't forcing the best friend and ex to interact beyond the procession. Maybe the issue is that the best friend is being forced to walk with someone she can't stand. But the author is also respecting the husband's family and friends. The ex is willing to let go of the feelings for the wedding, but the best friend isn't cooperating. \n\nIn terms of being the asshole (WIBTA), maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to include people important to them and their partner, and the conflict is between the best friend and the ex. The author isn't the one who caused the breakup, so they might not be at fault for not changing the order. However, if there's a way to adjust the order without excluding anyone, maybe the author could find a compromise. But if there's no feasible way, then the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nI think the key points are that the author isn't excluding anyone, both the best friend and the ex are important to different family members, and the conflict is between the two former partners. The author's decision is about maintaining their relationships with both people involved. So maybe the answer is B (author is not in the wrong) because they're not responsible for the ex and best friend's conflict and are trying to include important people in their wedding.\n"
