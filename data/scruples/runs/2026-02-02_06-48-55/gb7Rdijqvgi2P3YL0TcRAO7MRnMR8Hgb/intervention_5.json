Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order. The situation involves the author's best friend being paired with her ex in the wedding party, which the ex is willing to do, but the best friend is upset about.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The best friend and ex were engaged, but the friend accused the ex of cheating, leading to a breakup and unresolved tension. Now, the ex is the best man, and the author can't remove him without causing issues with the best man and maid of honor. The cousin insists on walking with her husband, who is also a friend of the groom. \n\nThe author is torn between their best friend and the necessity of having the best man. The question is whether not changing the order makes the author the asshole. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to balance everyone's needs. The ex is willing to be in the wedding, and the best friend's reaction has been extreme, even throwing a tantrum. The author can't control the ex's presence as it's part of the wedding party. The cousin's husband being in the group also adds complexity. \n\nThe author's main concern is their wedding day and not wanting to exclude someone important. They're feeling trapped but trying to make the best of a difficult situation. The best friend's behavior might be the issue here, as she's causing problems despite the ex being accommodating. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
