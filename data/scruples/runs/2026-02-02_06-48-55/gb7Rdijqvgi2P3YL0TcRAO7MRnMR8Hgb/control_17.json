Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the person is asking if they're the asshole for not changing the wedding procession order. Their best friend is upset because she has to walk with her ex, who she had a bad breakup with. The friend accused him of cheating, did some extreme things, and even though he wasn't cheating, they still hate each other. The ex is the best man, and the MOH is the sister. They can't uninvite the best man because he's the husband's best friend. The cousin wants to walk with her husband, who's also a friend of the fianc\u00e9. The author is torn because they don't want to exclude their best friend but also feel it's their wedding day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the relationships involved and the potential for hurt feelings. The author's best friend is upset, but so is the husband's best friend. The author is trying to balance their own wedding with the feelings of multiple people. \n\nThe best friend's actions in the past were extreme, even if the ex wasn't cheating. That might affect how the situation is viewed. However, the ex is part of the wedding party as the best man, which is a significant role. The author can't just uninvite him because he's the husband's best friend. The cousin also wants to walk with her husband, which is another factor.\n\nThe author is considering whether they're the asshole for not changing the order. The question is about fairness. The author is in their own wedding, so they might prioritize their day. However, the best friend has been a lifelong friend, and excluding her from the wedding party isn't possible, but having her walk with someone she despises is causing her distress.\n\nLegal or moral wrong here isn't clear. It's more about social judgment. The author is trying to manage multiple people's feelings. Since they can't exclude the best man or the cousin's husband, the only option left is the procession order. The author is feeling trapped, so their decision might be seen as reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nThe answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is trying to balance multiple relationships and their own wedding, and the best friend's distress is due to a past situation beyond the author's control. The author is making a choice that's necessary given the constraints, even if it causes some discomfort.\n"
