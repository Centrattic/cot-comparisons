Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order, which would mean their best friend has to walk with her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The best friend and her ex had a bad breakup where she accused him of cheating, did some extreme things like hiring a PI, and now they despise each other. The ex is the author's husband's best friend (best man), and the best friend is the author's best friend since middle school. The cousin wants to walk with her husband, who is also a friend. The author is stuck because they can't exclude the best man or maid of honor, and the cousin insists on her husband. The author feels bad for the best friend but also thinks this is their day, so maybe the friend should just deal with it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by not changing the order. Let's consider the key points. The author is trying to balance multiple relationships here. The best friend is important to them, but so is the best man (husband's brother) and the cousin's husband (who is also a friend). The author can't exclude those people without causing hurt feelings. The best friend is throwing a fit about having to walk with her ex, even though they're no longer together and have negative feelings. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the wedding is the author's day, so they should prioritize their own day, but they also want to include their best friend. However, the best friend's ex is part of the wedding party due to being the best man. The author isn't forcing the best friend and ex to interact beyond the procession. The procession is a short part of the day, maybe an hour. The author might feel they aren't in the wrong because they made a decision that honors their husband's side and cousin's wishes without excluding key people. \n\nBut some might argue that the author is putting the best friend in a difficult situation, but given that the ex is part of the wedding due to other relationships, maybe the author can't rearrange that. The author isn't forcing them to talk or interact beyond walking down the aisle. The best friend's reaction is a challenge, but the author can't control that. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're trying to balance multiple important relationships without excluding anyone essential. The answer might be B.\n"
