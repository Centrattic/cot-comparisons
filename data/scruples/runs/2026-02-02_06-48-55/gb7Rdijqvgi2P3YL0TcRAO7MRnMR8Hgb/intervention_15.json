Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order, which would require their best friend to walk with her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The best friend and her ex were engaged but had a falling out where the friend accused the ex of cheating and took extreme actions. The ex is willing to move past it, but the friend is upset. The author is caught between keeping their best friend in the wedding and including the best man (the ex) and the maid of honor (their sister). The cousin also wants to walk with her husband, who is the fianc\u00e9's friend.\n\nThe author feels bad for the best friend but also thinks it's their day and the friend should tolerate the hour. The key points here are the relationships involved and the potential harm of excluding someone. \n\nThe best friend has been a lifelong friend, and excluding her would hurt. On the other hand, the ex is the best man and part of the author's husband's close circle. The author can't just exclude them without causing issues. \n\nThe ex has moved on and is willing to be civil, but the friend is the one with lingering anger. The author is trying to balance multiple important relationships. Since the author is having the wedding, they might feel it's their right to have their family members in the processional. However, the best friend's emotional well-being is also a factor.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author is making the best of a bad situation where they can't exclude either the best friend or the ex, maybe they're not at fault. But if the author is forcing the best friend into a situation that's clearly uncomfortable without a valid reason, maybe they are. However, considering the numbers: they have a 6-person party, including the MOH and BM. The best friend and ex are #2, cousin and her husband #3. The author's sister is MOH, husband's brother is BM. So they can't just remove the ex because he's the BM. The cousin also wants her husband. So the author is constrained by other family and friends. \n\nThe best friend might have to walk with the ex because of the order. The author is trying to keep as many key people as possible. While it's causing conflict, it's part of the logistics of the wedding. The author isn't causing the initial conflict between the friend and ex; they're just trying to navigate it. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer could be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
