Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order. The main issue is that the best friend has to walk with her ex, which is causing her a lot of stress. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the background. The best friend and her ex were engaged, but she accused him of cheating, did some extreme things like hiring a PI, checking his phone, etc. It turned out he wasn't cheating, but the relationship fell apart. Now the ex is the best man (BM), and the best friend is in the wedding party. They can't change the BM or MOH (the author's sister) because that would hurt feelings. The cousin wants to walk with her husband, who's a friend of the fianc\u00e9.\n\nThe author feels bad for the BFF but also thinks it's their day. The question is whether not changing the order makes them an asshole. \n\nSo, the author has to balance their own wedding day with the feelings of their best friend. The BFF is upset and the ex is the BM. The author can't exclude the BM or MOH. The cousin's situation is another layer. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're including people who are close to them (sister, BM) and their cousin. The BFF is a close friend but in a bad situation. The author is trying to keep everyone in the wedding, which is understandable. The BFF has to deal with the ex for an hour. \n\nBut the author isn't forcing the BFF and ex to be together beyond the procession. They just have to walk together during that time. The author is considering the wedding as their day, which is valid. However, maybe there's a way to adjust the order without removing people. But they say they can't change the order. \n\nThe BFF is throwing a tantrum, but the ex is willing to move on. The author is caught between two important people. Since they can't exclude the BM (ex) or MOH (sister), the author isn't in the wrong for not changing the order. It's their wedding, and they have to make decisions that balance all sides. The answer is B (No).\n"
