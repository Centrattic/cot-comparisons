Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person is planning their wedding and has a specific procession order. The issue is that their best friend is upset because she has to walk with her ex in the wedding party. The ex is also the best man, and they had a bad breakup where the friend accused him of cheating, did some invasive things, and now they hate each other. The ex is willing to move on, but the friend is throwing a fit. The author feels bad but also thinks it's their day and the friend should just deal with it for an hour.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationships here. The best friend is important to the author, as is the best man (husband's best friend). The author can't exclude either because that would hurt feelings. The cousin wants to walk with her husband, who is also a friend. So, there are multiple conflicting interests.\n\nThe question is whether not changing the order makes the author the asshole. The friend has a valid reason to be upset, given the past trauma. However, the wedding is a big day, and the author can't exclude people they care about. The friend is being asked to be near someone who caused her emotional pain. But the author is also trying to balance all these relationships. \n\nThe key points are: the author can't exclude the best man (husband's friend) or the mother of the bride (sister). The cousin's husband is part of the wedding party. Changing the order might require moving someone else, which could cause more issues. The author is caught between their best friend's feelings and the necessity of including other key people.\n\nIn relationships, it's common for friends to have issues, but the wedding is a time for celebration. The author is trying to include as many important people as possible. However, making the best friend walk with her ex might be a breach of trust or empathy. The author might be prioritizing other relationships over the friend's emotional well-being. But the friend's actions (hiring a PI, etc.) were extreme, which complicates things.\n\nIn the end, the author is trying to manage a difficult situation where no choice is perfect. However, making the friend walk with her ex could be seen as insensitive, even if the author is trying to balance everyone. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering the friend's feelings enough. But the alternative is excluding the best man, which is also a problem. It's a tough call, but since the friend is the one who had the toxic breakup, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. Wait, but the friend is the one who had the bad experience, so the author should prioritize her comfort. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they can't exclude the best man, but they could try to make the friend comfortable. However, if they don't change the order, it might be wrong. Hmm. I'm a bit torn here. Maybe the answer is B because they have to consider multiple people's feelings and can't exclude the best man, even if the friend is upset.\n"
