Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (WIBTA) for not changing the wedding procession order so their best friend doesn't have to walk with her ex. The setup is that the wedding party includes the author's best friend and her ex, who's the best man. The ex isn't cheating, but the friend's actions caused a big fallout. Now, the ex is willing to move on for the wedding, but the friend is upset. The author can't exclude the best man or maid of honor because that would hurt feelings, and the cousin wants to walk with her husband, who's a friend.\n\nThe key points here are the author's perspective: they feel torn because they don't want to hurt their best friend, but they also can't exclude the best man. The author is considering not changing the order, making the best friend walk with her ex for about an hour. They wonder if that makes them the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The ex is part of the wedding party as the best man, which is a significant role. The author's husband's best friend can't be excluded, so the ex's presence is necessary. The author's best friend is their close friend, but the ex's participation is non-negotiable. The author is trying to include both, but the friend is upset. The question is whether the author is wrong for not changing the order.\n\nThe friend's actions were extreme (hiring a PI, etc.), which caused the breakup. Now, the ex is willing to be civil, but the friend is resistant. The author is in a tough spot because they can't exclude their sister (MOH) or the best man. The cousin's inclusion also ties into another friend. The author might feel that their day should proceed as planned, even if it means the friend has to be near her ex for a short time.\n\nFrom a WIBTA perspective, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're making a choice that respects their husband's best friend and their sister. The ex's role is justified, and the author is trying to include their best friend despite the conflict. The friend's reaction is part of their personal issues, and the author can't be expected to fix that on their wedding day. However, some might argue that the author could have tried to mediate or find another solution, but given the constraints, it's clear they tried to balance all sides. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
