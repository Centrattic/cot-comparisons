Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not changing their wedding procession order. The main issue is that their best friend is upset because she has to walk in the procession with her ex, who she had a messy breakup with. The ex isn't cheating, but her actions during the breakup caused a lot of hurt, and now they can't stand each other.\n\nThe wedding party has six people. The sister is the maid of honor, the husband's brother is the best man. The best friend and her ex are number two in the procession order. Then the cousin and her husband are third. The cousin's husband is also the fianc\u00e9's friend, which is why they can't remove them. The best friend is throwing a tantrum about having to be near her ex. The author feels bad for her but also thinks it's her day and the friend should just deal with it for an hour.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author is getting married, so this is a major life event. They want their best friend and the best man (husband's best friend) to be in the wedding. They can't exclude either without causing hurt feelings. The cousin is also insisting on being with her husband. So the author is stuck between keeping both the best friend and the best man, which means the ex has to be in the wedding party.\n\nThe best friend is upset because she has to interact with her ex, even briefly. The author feels bad but also thinks it's their day. The key points here are about respect, empathy, and whether the author is being unfair by not accommodating the friend's feelings.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author did consider the friend's feelings but can't change the order without removing someone else. They might have discussed this with the friend and tried to explain that they can't change the order. If the friend is throwing a tantrum, maybe the author isn't responsible for the friend's reaction. The author is trying to include both important people (best friend and best man) and can't exclude either. The friend's issues with her ex are from her past actions, so the author isn't necessarily at fault for the current situation. The author isn't forcing the ex to be in the wedding; the ex is there because he's the best man, a close friend of the husband. The author is in a tough spot where they have to balance multiple relationships. So, it's not entirely their fault. The answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
