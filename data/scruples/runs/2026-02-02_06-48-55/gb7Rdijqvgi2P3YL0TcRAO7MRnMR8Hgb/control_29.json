Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if they would be the asshole (WIBTA) if they don't change the wedding procession order, which would require their best friend to walk with her ex. \n\nFirst, the situation: The best friend and her ex are both in the wedding party. They had a messy breakup where the friend accused the ex of cheating, did some extreme things like hiring a PI, but it turned out he wasn't cheating. Now they hate each other. The ex is willing to be civil, but the friend is upset. The wedding party includes the author's sister (as maid of honor), husband's brother (best man), the best friend and her ex (position 2), and the cousin and her husband (position 3). \n\nThe user doesn't want to exclude the best friend or the best man since they're important. The cousin wants to walk with her husband, who's also the user's fianc\u00e9's friend. The user is stuck between keeping the procession as is, which upsets the best friend, or changing it to separate them, which might cause other issues.\n\nNow, considering the options. If the wedding day is supposed to be about the couple, maybe it's reasonable to prioritize their day over the friend's discomfort. The ex is willing to be civil, so the friend's reaction is her own issue. Also, the friend is the one who caused the initial conflict by doing invasive things. The user has already included the best man and maid of honor, which are key roles. The friend's ex is part of the wedding party because of the best man's role, not just for the friend. \n\nOn the other hand, the best friend is a close friend, and making her uncomfortable could strain the relationship. But the user is in a position where they have to balance multiple relationships. The friend is throwing a tantrum, which might indicate she's expecting others to accommodate her feelings, even though she was the one who contributed to the breakup drama. \n\nThe key points: The author is trying to include important people (best man, MOH, cousin). The friend's ex is part of the wedding party due to his role as best man. The friend is upset, but the ex is willing to be civil. The author is concerned about the friend's reaction but also about their own day. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They can't realistically exclude their husband's best man or their sister. The friend's behavior during the breakup might have set a precedent for her overreacting. The wedding is their day, and they have to make the best of it. The friend should manage her own feelings, even if it's uncomfortable for an hour. So the answer would be B, no.\n"
