Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order, which would require their best friend to walk with her ex. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The wedding party includes the author's sister as Maid of Honor and the husband's brother as Best Man. The best friend and her ex are second in the procession, followed by the cousin and her husband. The problem is that the best friend and her ex are in a bad situation. They were engaged, but the friend accused the ex of cheating, leading to a breakdown in their relationship. Now, the ex is willing to be civil, but the friend is upset.\n\nThe author wants to include both the best friend and the ex (as the best man) without causing further issues. They feel trapped because excluding either the best friend or the ex would hurt feelings. The cousin also insists on walking with her husband, who is part of the wedding party. \n\nThe author is conflicted: they feel bad for the friend but also think it's their day and the friend should handle an hour of being with the ex. The question is whether not changing the order makes the author the asshole.\n\nTo determine if the author is wrong, consider if they have a moral obligation to change the order. The author's best friend is in a tough spot, but the ex is part of the wedding party as the best man. The author has tried to include both as friends but now faces a conflict. The friend is throwing a tantrum, which complicates things. \n\nIs it reasonable to expect the friend to handle an hour together? The author's day is important, but the friend's emotional state is also a factor. However, the author isn't forcing them to interact beyond the ceremony. They might not be in the same location after the procession. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being unfair by not adjusting the order. The author has considered the feelings of multiple people and can't change the order without causing hurt elsewhere. The ex is willing to be civil, so maybe the friend needs to manage her emotions. \n\nI think the author isn't necessarily wrong. They're trying to balance everyone's needs and it's their wedding day. The friend's reaction is extreme, but the author isn't causing ongoing interaction beyond the ceremony. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
