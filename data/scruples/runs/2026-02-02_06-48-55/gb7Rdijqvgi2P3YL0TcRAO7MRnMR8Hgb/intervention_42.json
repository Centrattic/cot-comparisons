Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order so that their best friend doesn't have to walk with her ex. Let me consider the situation.\n\nFirst, the wedding party setup: the author's best friend and her ex are both in the wedding party. The ex is the best man (husband's brother), and the best friend is the maid of honor's sister? Wait, no, the setup is sister is MOH (maid of honor), husband's brother is BM (best man). The best friend and her ex are #2 in the procession. Then the cousin and her husband are #3. The problem is that the best friend and her ex can't stand each other now due to past issues, but the ex is still part of the wedding party because he's the best man. The author is worried about not changing the order, making the best friend walk with her ex during the procession. The best friend is upset, while the ex is willing to let it go. The author feels trapped because they can't exclude the best man or the maid of honor (their sister), and the cousin wants to walk with her husband. The author is considering whether they're an asshole if they don't change the order.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But the question is whether the author is actually in the wrong. Let me think. The key points here are the relationships involved. The best friend and ex are on bad terms, but the ex is part of the wedding due to being the best man (the husband's brother). The author's own family members (sister and cousin) are also in the wedding party, and they can't be excluded without causing hurt feelings. The best friend is the author's best friend since middle school, so excluding her isn't an option. The author is trying to balance between their best friend's feelings and their husband's brother being part of the wedding.\n\nIs the author obligated to change the procession order? Well, the procession order in a wedding typically follows a certain tradition. The maid of honor and best man usually walk in after the flower girl and ring bearer (if there are any), but the exact order can vary. If the best friend is part of the wedding party, but her ex is also part of it, maybe their positions could be adjusted so they don't have to walk together. However, in this case, they are in the same position, so they would walk together. The author is considering if they should change it so the best friend doesn't have to walk with her ex. But changing the order might require moving other people's positions, which could cause issues. For example, moving the best friend to walk with someone else might affect the cousin or the MOH's sister.\n\nThe author is feeling conflicted because they don't want to hurt their best friend but also don't want to exclude their own family members. The ex is willing to move on, but the best friend is upset. The author's main concern is whether they're being selfish by not changing the order. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. Here's why: Weddings are about the couple, and they have the final say on the details. The author is trying to include their best friend despite the conflict, which shows they value the friendship. The ex is part of the wedding because he's the best man, which is his role as the husband's brother. The cousin also wants to walk with her husband, another family member. The author is making a choice that prioritizes their own family and their best friend's presence, even if it means the best friend has to walk with her ex for a short time. Since the ex is willing to let it go, and the author can't exclude him, it's a difficult but reasonable decision. The author isn't ignoring the best friend's feelings, but they're making a choice that balances multiple relationships. The best friend's reaction is her own choice, but the author isn't obligated to rearrange everything to make her comfortable. So, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
