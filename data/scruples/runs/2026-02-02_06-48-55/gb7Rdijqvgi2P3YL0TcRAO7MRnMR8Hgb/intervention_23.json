Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding the wedding procession order. The situation involves the author's best friend being upset because she has to walk with her ex during the wedding, even though they're no longer together and there's a lot of tension from past events. The author is trying to balance keeping both the best friend and the ex in the wedding party because they're important people. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The best friend and her ex are still in a hostile situation because of the cheating accusations and the fallout. The author doesn't want to exclude the best friend, who's been a lifelong friend, but the ex is the husband's best man and can't be excluded either. The cousin also wants to walk with her husband, another close friend. The author is conflicted but feels it's their day and might prioritize their own comfort over the friend's.\n\nNow, the key points here are the importance of the wedding day for the author, the relationships involved, and the potential harm in excluding someone. The author's best friend is throwing a tantrum, which complicates things. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the order. \n\nIn similar situations, people often argue that the wedding is the couple's day, so they should have the final say. However, causing emotional distress to a close friend could be seen as inconsiderate. But since the author has already tried to include everyone and can't exclude the ex (as he's the best man), the conflict is unavoidable. The author is caught between two important relationships. \n\nThe ex's role is fixed because he's the best man, so the author can't remove him. The best friend's walk with the ex is part of the procession. The author might not be in the wrong because they're not forcing the ex and best friend to interact beyond the ceremony. The main issue is the order, but changing it might not be feasible due to the other participants' preferences. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is part of the problem. If the friend is being unreasonable, the author isn't necessarily at fault. The author is trying to make the best of a difficult situation where they can't exclude anyone without causing more hurt. So, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong, because they're navigating complex relationships and prioritizing the wedding's structure.\n"
