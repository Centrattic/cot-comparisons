Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order, which would require their best friend to walk with her ex. The situation is a bit complicated. \n\nFirst, the best friend and her ex had a falling out where she accused him of cheating and did some extreme things like hiring a PI and checking his stuff. It turned out he wasn't cheating, but their relationship is now toxic. The ex is the best man (BM) because he's the husband's best friend, and the MOH (mother of the bride's sister) is already in place. The cousin wants to walk with her husband, who is a friend, so the procession order is fixed with the best friend and her ex in the second position. \n\nThe author is conflicted because they don't want to upset their best friend, but they also can't exclude the best man or MOH without causing other issues. They feel that this is their day and maybe the best friend should just tolerate the hour with the ex.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author is trying to balance multiple important relationships. The best friend has been a close friend since middle school, and the ex is a key part of the groom's side. The cousin's request adds another layer. \n\nIs the author being unfair by not changing the order? Well, the wedding procession order is a logistical decision that might not be easily changed once plans are set. The author isn't making the best friend walk with the ex intentionally to hurt her, but they are acknowledging the existing roles. The ex isn't being forced to interact beyond the ceremony. The best friend is upset, but the author is trying to manage their own wedding while considering other people's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the best friend's distress is real, and the author is aware of the history. However, changing the order might not be feasible due to the other commitments (cousin walking with husband, BM and MOH positions). The author isn't excluding anyone; they're keeping everyone involved. The main conflict is whether the author is prioritizing their own event over the friend's discomfort. \n\nIn these situations, it's common for people to feel trapped between conflicting loyalties. The key point is that the author isn't forcing any interaction beyond the ceremony. The best friend will have to walk with her ex for a short time, but after that, they don't have to interact. The author is making a call that their wedding day is important, and they can't accommodate every possible preference of all guests. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a pragmatic decision to proceed with the existing order, which involves people they can't exclude without causing more hurt elsewhere. The answer should be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
