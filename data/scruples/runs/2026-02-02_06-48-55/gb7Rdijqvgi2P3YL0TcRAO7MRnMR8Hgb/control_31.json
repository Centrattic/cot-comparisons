Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order so their best friend doesn't have to walk with her ex. The background is that the best friend and her ex had a bad breakup where she accused him of cheating, did some intense stuff like hiring a PI, and now they hate each other. The ex is the best man, and the best friend is a bridesmaid. They can't exclude either because they're important to the couple, and the cousin wants to walk with her husband, who is a close friend.\n\nThe user feels bad for the best friend but also thinks this is their day and the friend should just deal with it. The question is if not changing the order makes the author the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author has a right to prioritize their own wedding. Weddings are personal, and the couple usually chooses their processional order. However, the friend's trauma from the breakup is a factor here. But the ex is the best man, so excluding him isn't an option. The author isn't forcing the ex to be there; he's there because he's in the wedding party.\n\nThe friend is upset, but the author is in a tough spot because they can't exclude key family members. The ex is willing to move on, but the friend is the one causing the issue. The author isn't forcing the friend to be near the ex beyond the procession. Maybe an hour is a small price for the friend to pay, especially since they can avoid each other afterward. The author is trying to balance multiple important relationships and their own comfort. Since the ex isn't being mistreated and the best friend's discomfort is her own to deal with (as the author can't control that), the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
