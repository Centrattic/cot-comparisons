Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order. The background is that the author's best friend (BFF) has to walk with her ex during the wedding, which is causing tension. The BFF is upset because of past issues where she suspected cheating and did some extreme things, even though he wasn't cheating. Now they despise each other. The ex is the best man's best friend and can't be excluded because of that. The author is torn between not wanting to hurt the BFF but also feeling it's their day.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is the asshole (WIBTA) if they don't change the order. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The user wants me to answer A (yes) or B (no) based on the analysis.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The author is trying to balance multiple relationships. The BFF is a key part of the wedding, as is the ex (being the best man). The cousin also has her husband in the wedding party. The author is in a tough spot because changing the order would cause one person to be upset, not changing would upset another. \n\nThe key points here are: the BFF's past actions were extreme (hiring a PI, etc.), which led to a breakdown in the relationship. The ex is still part of the wedding party because of his role with the groom. The author is prioritizing their own wedding day and the inclusion of multiple important people. \n\nIs the author wrong for not changing the order? Well, the author is making a decision that affects their wedding day. They've already considered the feelings of others but can't satisfy everyone. The BFF is throwing a tantrum, but the author isn't responsible for the BFF's past actions. The ex is part of the wedding due to his connection to the groom. The author isn't necessarily at fault here because they can't exclude people who are integral to the wedding. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground. For example, adjusting the procession order slightly to minimize interaction. But the author says they can't change it because the best man and maid of honor can't be excluded. So, they're stuck between two people they can't exclude. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong for not changing the order because they're prioritizing their own day and maintaining important relationships. The BFF's discomfort is a result of her own past relationship issues, not the author's actions. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B: the author is not in the wrong.\n"
