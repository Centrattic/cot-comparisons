Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order, which would require their best friend to walk with her ex. The background is that the best friend and ex had a messy breakup where she accused him of cheating, did some invasive things like hiring a PI, and they now hate each other. The husband's best friend is the ex, so he can't be excluded. The author is caught between keeping their best friend and not wanting to hurt their feelings, but also not wanting to exclude the best man and maid of honor.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to balance their relationships. The best friend is important to them, but the ex is important to the groom. The author feels bad for the friend but also sees this as their day. The key question is whether the author is wrong for not changing the order.\n\nIf the author doesn't change the order, the best friend has to walk with her ex, which could cause her distress. But the author can't exclude the ex because he's the groom's best friend. The cousin also wants to walk with her husband, another friend of the groom. So, the author is stuck with this setup.\n\nNow, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate. The author isn't doing anything malicious. They're trying to include important people in their wedding. The problem is that their best friend is in a bad situation. However, the ex isn't the groom's fault; he's just a friend. The author isn't making the ex and the friend interact beyond the procession. Maybe the friend can handle it for an hour. If the friend is throwing a tantrum, maybe she's being unreasonable. The author can't control the past relationship issues, so they aren't at fault for not changing the order. They're prioritizing their own wedding day and other family members. It's a tough spot, but not their fault. So, answer B.\n"
