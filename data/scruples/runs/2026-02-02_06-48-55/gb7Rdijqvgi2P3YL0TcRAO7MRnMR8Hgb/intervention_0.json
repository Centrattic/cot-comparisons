Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order. The situation is that the author's best friend is upset because she has to walk with her ex in the procession. The ex and the best friend had a messy breakup where the friend accused the ex of cheating, which turned out not to be true. The ex is the author's husband's best friend, so he has to be in the wedding party as the Best Man. The best friend is throwing a tantrum about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's best friend is close to her, and the author doesn't want to exclude her. The ex is the Best Man, so he can't be left out either. The author is feeling conflicted because she wants to include both but the situation is causing stress. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not changing the order, making the best friend have to walk with her ex.\n\nOn one hand, the author's wedding day is personal, and they have the right to choose the order. They might not want to change it because of logistical reasons, like the other people in the wedding party (cousin and her husband, etc.). Changing the order might cause other issues. On the other hand, the best friend is a close friend who might be upset. But the ex and friend's issues are their own, and the author might not be responsible for their past conflict. The author isn't forcing them to interact beyond the procession. Also, the ex is willing to move past it, which shows some maturity, while the best friend is being difficult. \n\nConsidering the options: If the answer is A (author is in the wrong), that would mean the author should prioritize the friend's feelings and change the order. But if it's B (not in the wrong), then the author is justified in keeping the order as it's her day. \n\nI need to weigh the responsibilities. The author isn't causing the conflict; she's accommodating two people who have an existing issue. She's trying to include both the best friend and the Best Man. Since the ex is part of the wedding party due to being the Best Man, it's reasonable for the author to keep the traditional order. The friend's reaction is her responsibility, not the author's. The author is making a choice that prioritizes her wedding day and maintaining relationships with both the best friend and the Best Man, which are important. The ex is willing to move past it, so the main issue is the friend's refusal to cooperate. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She's balancing multiple commitments and making a choice that's reasonable given the circumstances. The friend's actions in the past led to the current issue, not the author's decisions. The author isn't forcing them to interact beyond the procession, and it's a one-time event. So the answer is B.\n"
