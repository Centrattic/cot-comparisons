Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a wedding procession order. The person is getting married and has a wedding party. The main conflict is that their best friend has to walk with her ex because of the order. The background is that the best friend and ex had a messy breakup where the friend accused the ex of cheating, did some intense stuff like hiring a PI, and now they hate each other. The ex is the best man and can't be excluded, and the cousin wants to walk with her husband who is a friend of the groom. The author is stuck because they don't want to hurt their best friend but also don't want to exclude the best man or the maid of honor or the cousin.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is obligated to change the order. The best friend is a key part of the wedding, as is the best man. The author is trying to balance multiple important relationships. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the order. \n\nThe best friend is upset, but the author is also in a position where changing the order might be difficult. For example, if the cousin and her husband are next in line, changing the order might not be straightforward. Also, the ex is willing to put aside feelings, so maybe the problem is more on the best friend's side. The author might feel they have no control over the ex's presence since he's the best man and the groom's friend.\n\nBut is the author responsible for the best friend's discomfort? The author is the one planning the wedding, so they have the power to make changes. However, the author is also dealing with multiple people's feelings. The best friend has a history of intense behavior, so maybe she's being unreasonable in expecting the order to change. The author might not be in the wrong because they can't accommodate everyone's preferences, especially when other people are already in fixed positions. Also, the author is prioritizing their best friend's inclusion, which shows they care. \n\nOn the other hand, not changing the order might make the best friend feel hurt. But the author's day is the wedding, so they might have the right to decide the order. The key points are the best friend's unreasonable demands versus the author's need to manage the wedding party. Since the ex is part of the wedding through the best man role and the cousin's husband is also in the procession, changing the order could cause more issues. The author might not be the asshole because they're trying to include everyone and can't be expected to change things for one person's discomfort, especially when others are already in place. So the answer is probably B (No)."
