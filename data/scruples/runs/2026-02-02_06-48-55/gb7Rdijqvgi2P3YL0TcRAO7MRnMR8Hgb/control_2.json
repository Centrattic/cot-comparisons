Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order, which would require her best friend to walk with her ex. The background is that the best friend and ex had a major falling out after she accused him of cheating and did some invasive things. Now they despise each other, but the ex is the best man and the cousin wants to walk with her husband, who's a friend of the groom. The author is torn between her best friend's discomfort and her own wedding day.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ethical angle here. The question is about whether the author is being an asshole by not changing the order. The key points are the friendships and the relationships involved. The author has been friends with her best friend since middle school, and the ex is the groom's best friend, so they can't uninvite him. The cousin also wants to walk with her husband, so changing the order might cause another problem. \n\nThe author is feeling bad for her best friend but is also thinking it's her day. The main conflict is between the friend's feelings and the author's right to have her wedding as planned. The ex is willing to let bygones be bygones, but the friend is throwing a tantrum. \n\nNow, to decide if she's in the wrong. The author can't uninvite the best man or the maid of honor because that would cause hurt feelings. So she's caught between two friends. The author is trying to balance her own event with her friend's emotional well-being. Since the ex is part of the wedding party by necessity (as the best man) and the cousin's husband is part of the procession, changing the order might not be feasible without causing other issues. \n\nThe author isn't forcing the friend to interact beyond the procession. The friend is upset about walking with him for an hour, but after the wedding, they don't have to see each other. The author is prioritizing the structure of her wedding and maintaining the relationships with the best man and maid of honor, which are crucial roles. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author isn't making the ex friend walk with her ex beyond the procession. The main issue is the procession order. If changing the order is not possible without causing more problems, then the author isn't in the wrong for keeping it as is. She's trying to manage her event while considering the feelings of multiple people. The best friend's reaction is a problem, but the author can't control that. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. She's making a tough choice between her own wedding and her friend's feelings, but given the circumstances, she's not the asshole for keeping the procession order as it is.\n"
