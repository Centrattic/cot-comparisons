Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order. The main issue is that the best friend and her ex are walking together, even though they had a messy breakup. The author is stuck between keeping both the best friend and the best man (the ex) in the wedding, which are important people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The best friend and ex's breakup was messy, with the friend doing some extreme things like hiring a P.I. and checking his stuff. The ex wasn't cheating, but the friend's actions caused a lot of hurt. Now, the ex is willing to move on for the wedding, but the friend is upset. The author can't exclude either because they're close to the author and her fianc\u00e9.\n\nThe author is feeling bad but also thinks it's their day. The question is whether not changing the order makes them the asshole. \n\nI think the key points are: the author is trying to balance her wedding day with keeping important people in her life happy. She's not forcing them to interact beyond the procession. The ex is willing to go along, even if the friend is not. The author isn't making the ex and friend talk or be together beyond the procession. Since they are both in the wedding party, the author is prioritizing her relationships with both, which is understandable. \n\nThe friend is upset, but the author isn't the one who caused the breakup. The author isn't forcing the ex and friend to reconcile; they just have to walk together during the ceremony. Given that the author is in a tough spot and trying to include everyone, I don't think she's the asshole here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
