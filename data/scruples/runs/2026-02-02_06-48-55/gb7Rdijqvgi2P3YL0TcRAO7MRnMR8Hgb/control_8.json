Meaning my best friend will have to walk with her ex.\nBackground. I'm getting married in May. We have a 6 person wedding party. My sister=MOH, husbands bro=BM. best friend and her ex are #2. My cousin and her husband= #3\n\nLast year, my best friend and her ex were engaged but she thought he was cheating. She went off the deep end, went through his phone, computer and mail, she hired private investigator to follow him, she followed him, Etc... It turns out he wasn't cheating but her actions caused a lot of hurt feelings and now they despise each other. Her ex is willing to get over his feelings for our wedding, she's throwing a major tantrum over it.\n\nWe've been beef friends since middle school and I'd be heartbroken if she wasn't in my wedding. Her ex is my husbands best friend and he can't not be in the wedding either. We can't uninvite the best man and MOH because that would cause hurt feelings. And my cousin is insisting she walk with her husband who is also one of my Fiance's beef friends (and how we met). \n\nI feel so bad for BFF but part of me feels like this is my day and she should just be cool for the maybe hour she has to be with him and then she never has to speak to him again. I don't know, I feel trapped by this situation.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I don't change the order?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not changing the wedding procession order. The key points are:\n\n- The wedding party includes the author's best friend and her ex, who are now estranged due to a past engagement fallout. The ex is the best man, so he can't be left out. The cousin is walking with her husband, who is the best man's friend. The best friend is upset about having to be near her ex during the procession.\n\nThe author is considering not changing the order, even though the friend is upset. They feel bad but also think it's their day.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the ex is part of the wedding party because he's the best man. The author's husband's brother is the best man. The ex can't be excluded. The author's best friend is thrown into a situation where she has to walk with her ex, which is causing her distress. However, the author can't exclude the best man either. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not changing the order. The author is trying to balance including both their close friends and family without causing more hurt. They're not excluding anyone; they're just stuck with the existing order. The ex is part of the wedding party regardless of the friend's feelings. \n\nThe best friend's reaction seems extreme, but the author is trying to manage the situation. The author's main responsibility is their own wedding day, and they're trying to include as many important people as possible. Since there's no option to exclude either the best man or the best friend, the author isn't necessarily at fault for not changing the order. They might be in a tough spot, but the wrong isn't on their side. The answer is B.\n"
