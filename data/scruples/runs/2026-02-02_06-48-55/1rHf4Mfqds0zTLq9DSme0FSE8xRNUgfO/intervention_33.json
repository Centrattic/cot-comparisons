Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully. \n\nThe author is a 22-year-old male working in a female-dominated software startup. He's in sales and has been performing exceptionally well, earning high commissions. The problem is that some female colleagues have been spreading hurtful and sexist comments about him, which he eventually took to the CEO, leading to two women being fired. Now he's feeling like an asshole and is asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author was subjected to workplace bullying, including sexist remarks. He tried to ignore it initially but when the behavior escalated, he gathered evidence and confronted the CEO. The CEO took action, firing two employees and addressing the issue. The author is now the office pariah and feeling guilty. His friend accused him of being \"dickish\" for not confronting them directly first and suggested the comments, though hurtful, might just be jokes.\n\nSo, the main ethical question here is whether the author acted appropriately in reporting the bullying. On one hand, workplace harassment is serious, and reporting it is a valid action. On the other hand, his friend's advice was to confront the individuals first, which he didn't do. \n\nWorkplace policies usually encourage reporting harassment to HR or a higher-up if the behavior persists despite direct confrontation. However, the author didn't try to address the individuals first, which could be seen as a mistake. But considering the nature of the comments\u2014sexist and derogatory\u2014it's possible that confronting them directly might not have been safe or effective, especially if the environment was already hostile. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for sexism in the situation. The author made high commissions, and some colleagues attributed it to his gender, which his friend also pointed out. This could indicate a toxic environment where gender bias exists. The author's actions led to the termination of two employees, which is a significant consequence. However, the comments were severe enough to warrant action if they created a hostile work environment.\n\nThe author's friend suggested that the comments might be \"just joking,\" but the screenshots showed hurtful and targeted remarks. That line between joking and harassment is thin, but if the comments were persistent and targeted, they cross into bullying. \n\nThe question is whether the author's method of resolving the issue was appropriate. If he had first tried to address the individuals directly and then escalated when that failed, it might have been a more responsible approach. However, in some cases, especially if the company culture is such that direct confrontation isn't effective, going to the CEO right away might be necessary. \n\nAlso, the CEO's response was to fire two people and bring in an HR consultant. That indicates that the company took the matter seriously. The author's intention was to stop the bullying, which is a valid reason. However, the outcome left him as the office pariah, which is a social consequence, but the ethical question is about his actions.\n\nIn terms of whether he's in the wrong: if the comments were indeed harassing and he reported them, then he's not in the wrong. But if he bypassed the step of confronting the individuals first, which is often a recommended step in workplace conflict resolution, that could be a misstep. However, the severity of the comments and the fact that they were targeting him because of his gender might make the direct confrontation unsafe or ineffective. \n\nSo, considering the options, the answer hinges on whether the author's method (reporting directly to the CEO without confronting the individuals first) was the appropriate step. If the company's policies require escalating directly, then he's right. If not, then he might have skipped a step. But given the context of harassment and the potential gender bias, it's possible that the direct approach was necessary. \n\nTherefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but there are nuances. However, the friend's advice is also valid in that confronting first is usually better. It's a gray area, but since the author's actions led to stopping harassment, the answer could lean towards not in the wrong (B). However, the bypassing the initial confrontation step might make him partially at fault. But given the severity of the comments and the potential for a hostile workplace, the answer might still be B.\n"
