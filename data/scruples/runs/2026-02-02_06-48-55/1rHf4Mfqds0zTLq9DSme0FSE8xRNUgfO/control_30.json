Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for getting two women at their office fired. The situation involves workplace bullying, gender dynamics, and whether the author took the right approach.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old sales rep in a female-dominated startup. He's making high commissions, which leads to some of his female colleagues making derogatory and sexist comments about him, including personal appearance and suggesting he's successful only because he's a man. These comments were spread through messages, some of which were shown to his friend, the office manager. The author eventually gathers evidence and reports the situation to the CEO, leading to two women being fired and others written up. Now, he's feeling guilty and questioning if he did the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n1. Were the comments and behavior from the female colleagues actually bullying or harassment?\n2. Did the author handle the situation appropriately?\n3. Is there an element of gender bias or sexism in the situation?\n4. Is the author in the wrong for going to the CEO instead of addressing the issue directly?\n\nStarting with the first point: The messages included things like mocking his height, implying he has a small \"dick,\" and suggesting his success is due to being male. These are clearly personal and derogatory, which can be considered bullying. The fact that these comments were made in a work environment and targeted at a colleague based on gender is problematic. If these were true instances of harassment, then the company has a responsibility to address them.\n\nSecond, how the author handled it. The friend (office manager) showed him the messages, and he decided to collect screenshots and report to the CEO. His friend later criticized him for not confronting the women directly. In workplace harassment situations, the appropriate steps can vary. Companies often have policies on how to report such issues, and in this case, the CEO is the one who would handle it. However, the question is whether the author should have taken a different approach first. But given that the comments were spreading and potentially creating a hostile work environment, going to the CEO might be a valid step, especially if direct confrontation isn't effective or safe.\n\nThird, the gender dynamics. The author is a male in a female-dominated office, and the harassment is partly based on his gender. The office manager friend mentions that the other women might see his success as a threat and are making sexist comments. The friend also suggests that the situation is a case of sexism, which adds another layer. However, the author's actions might be seen as perpetuating gender issues, especially if the women were retaliating against his success in a male-dominated field.\n\nFourth, the consequences. The CEO fired two women, which is a severe action. The author is now the office pariah, and he's feeling guilty. His friend thinks he was \"dickish\" for not confronting them directly. However, the severity of the comments and the evidence presented might justify the CEO's actions. The question is whether the punishment was too harsh, but the CEO determined it was workplace bullying, which is a valid reason for termination.\n\nNow, legal and ethical considerations. If the workplace environment is hostile due to harassment, the company has a duty to address it. The author's actions in reporting the harassment could be justified if the comments were indeed harmful and persistent. However, the method of handling it\u2014using evidence collected from a friend and then going directly to the CEO\u2014might be seen as bypassing proper channels, depending on the company's policies. Some might argue he should have addressed it with HR or followed a more formal process, but in a small startup, going to the CEO directly could be typical.\n\nAnother aspect is whether the author overreacted. The comments, while hurtful, might be interpreted as jokes in a workplace. The friend's comment that \"childish comments shouldn't get them fired\" suggests that the punishment might be too harsh for what could be considered workplace banter. However, if the messages were clearly bullying and not just jokes, then the CEO's response is appropriate.\n\nIn terms of the author's guilt, he's questioning if he's in the wrong. The key is whether the actions taken were necessary to address a hostile work environment. The author was being bullied, which is a serious issue. The CEO's decision to take action based on the evidence the author provided might be justified. However, the author's approach might have been seen as escalatory without first trying to resolve the issue internally, which could affect workplace relationships.\n\nSo, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? The answer depends on the severity of the bullying and the appropriateness of the response. If the comments were indeed harassment, then the author was right to report them. However, the method of going to the CEO with evidence from a friend might not follow standard procedures, but in a small company, it could be acceptable. The firing of the two women might have been necessary if the behavior was severe and persistent. On the other hand, if the comments were not severe enough to warrant termination and were more about workplace rivalry, the author might have overstepped.\n\nThe author's friend's perspective is that he should have confronted them directly, which is a valid approach. However, in cases of harassment, direct confrontation might not be effective or safe. The author's actions led to a resolution, but it's possible that the consequences were too harsh, leading to guilt. The fact that the author is feeling guilty and questioning their actions suggests internal conflict, which is normal in such situations.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a complex situation with valid arguments on both sides. However, if the behavior of the female colleagues constitutes workplace harassment, then the author's actions were justified. The company's response, while severe, is within their right to address a toxic environment. The author might be in the right if the harassment was real and properly reported. However, the method of reporting and the outcome's severity could be points of contention. Considering all factors, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), but there are nuances. However, since the user is asking for a simple A or B, and considering the nature of the comments and the CEO's response being appropriate, the answer would be B.\n"
