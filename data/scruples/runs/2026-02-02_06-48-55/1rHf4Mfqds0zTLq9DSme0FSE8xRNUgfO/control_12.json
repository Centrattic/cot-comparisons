Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 22-year-old male working in a female-dominated tech startup, made two women lose their jobs after reporting their bullying behavior to the CEO. The key points here are the nature of the workplace environment, the actions taken, and whether those actions were justified.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the workplace is mostly women, and after he started outperforming them in commissions, he faced catty comments and bullying. He collected evidence, showed it to the CEO, and as a result, two women were fired and others written up. Now he's feeling guilty because he's the office pariah and his friend thinks he acted too harshly.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's actions were appropriate. Let's break it down. Workplaces have a zero-tolerance policy for bullying and harassment. If the comments were indeed threatening or created a toxic environment, then the author was right to report them. However, the line between playful teasing and harassment can be blurry. The author's friend argues that the comments were childish and not worthy of termination, suggesting maybe they were just joking. But the author provided screenshots of hurtful comments, like making fun of his appearance and implying sexism. If those comments were malicious and persistent, they might constitute harassment.\n\nThe CEO's response was to fire two employees and write up others. Depending on the company's HR policies and the severity of the evidence, this could be justified. However, going straight to termination without giving the employees a chance to address the behavior might be too harsh, especially if the comments were not legally actionable. The author's friend also points out that direct confrontation would have been better, which is a valid point. Escalating to the CEO immediately might have been seen as a heavy-handed approach without exhausting other options first.\n\nAdditionally, the author's motivation might be questioned. While the bullying was real, the fact that he was making significantly more money could have contributed to the tension. There's a possibility of bias in how the situation was handled. The friend's comment about sexism adds another layer\u2014maybe the women were targeted because of his gender or their jealousy. The author might have overreacted, leading to a toxic environment where he's now the pariah.\n\nIn conclusion, while workplace bullying is serious, the author's approach might have been too aggressive without proper due process. He could have first addressed the issue directly with the individuals or through formal channels that allow for a fair assessment. Firing employees based on social media-like messages without a thorough investigation could be seen as the author's fault, especially if the company's HR procedures weren't followed properly. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but it's nuanced.\n"
