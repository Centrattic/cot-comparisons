Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong for getting two women at his office fired. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old male in a female-dominated tech startup. He's a top-performing sales rep, earning high commissions. The other employees, mostly women, have been making hurtful comments about him, including sexist remarks. He didn't confront them directly but instead went to the CEO with evidence, leading to two women being fired. Now he feels guilty and wonders if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: workplace bullying, the method of addressing the issue (going to the CEO instead of addressing it directly), and the consequences (two women losing jobs). \n\nThe author's actions: He collected evidence, went to the CEO, and the CEO took action. The colleague (friend) suggested he should have confronted them first, not gone straight to management. Also, there's a mention of possible sexism because he earned more than the women, even though it's performance-based. The friend argues that the comments (about his height, small penis, etc.) are childish and not grounds for firing.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, workplace harassment is serious. If the comments were creating a hostile environment, then the company should address it. However, the author didn't escalate the issue until after the last incident with a large commission. Also, he didn't confront the individuals first, which the friend pointed out. \n\nBut then, the CEO did fire two people and wrote others up. The question is, was the author right to go straight to the CEO? In some cases, bypassing direct confrontation and going to management is appropriate, especially if the harassment is severe. However, the friend's advice to confront them first might be valid, as direct communication can sometimes resolve issues without needing formal action.\n\nAnother angle is the potential sexism. The women accused the author of getting better leads because he's a man. If the commission is truly performance-based, then the author's success is due to his performance. However, if the company's practices inadvertently favor men (like in lead allocation), that's a problem. The author's friend suggests that the pay disparity might be due to sexism, which complicates things.\n\nThe author might feel guilty because he caused colleagues to lose jobs. However, if the workplace environment was toxic and harmful, it's a necessary step. The key here is whether the author's actions were proportional. The comments were hurtful and included harassment, so the company's response (firing two and writing up others) might be justified if they've violated company policies.\n\nBut the user's friend thinks it's childish and they were joking. If the company didn't have clear policies against such behavior, the women might not have known their comments were problematic. The author could have escalated earlier, but in this case, he did after collecting evidence. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: The harassment was real and needed to be addressed. However, the method of addressing it (going to the CEO instead of confronting first) might be seen as harsh. The author's friend's perspective is valid in suggesting a different approach. But the author's right to a safe work environment is also important. \n\nI think the author isn't entirely in the wrong. The harassment was serious, and he took steps to address it. However, the method could have been better handled. But ultimately, it's a judgment call. The answer might depend on the company's policies and the severity of the harassment. Given that the CEO took action and the comments were offensive, the author's actions might be justified. However, the friend's point about confronting them first is valid. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there are valid arguments on both sides. However, since the question is a yes or no, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he reported legitimate harassment, even if the approach could have been improved.\n"
