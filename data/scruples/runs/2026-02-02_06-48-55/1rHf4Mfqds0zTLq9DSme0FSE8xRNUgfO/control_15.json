Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author of the AITA post) is in the wrong for getting two women at his office fired. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old male working in a female-dominated tech startup. He's a top performer, making high commissions. The other employees, mostly women, started spreading hurtful comments about him, especially after he outperformed them. The comments included personal attacks (like mocking his height and implying he has a small penis) and accusations of sexism because he's a man. Despite trying to brush it off, he eventually showed these messages to the CEO, leading to two women being fired and others being written up. Now he's feeling guilty and is asking if he's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: workplace bullying, the author's response (reporting it to the CEO), and the consequences (firing two employees). The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the women made derogatory and potentially sexist comments, which is unprofessional and creates a hostile work environment. The author has a right to feel targeted and to report such behavior. On the other hand, maybe he could have handled it differently first, like talking to them directly, as his friend suggested. But if the comments were ongoing and created a toxic environment, then perhaps his approach was justified.\n\nAnother angle is whether the CEO's response was appropriate. Firing two employees for workplace bullying, even if they were joking, might be a valid action if the company has policies against harassment. However, if the messages were just \"jokes,\" maybe the punishment was too harsh. But the author's friend argues that the comments were hurtful and not just jokes, so the CEO's action might be in line with company policy.\n\nAlso, the author's friend suggested that the issue might be sexism, implying that the women's resentment came from his higher earnings as a man. That's a possible underlying factor, but the author's main action was reporting the bullying, not the fact that he made more money. However, if the bullying was indeed due to sexism, then firing the employees might address a deeper issue.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for reporting the bullying? If the environment was toxic and the comments were unprofessional, then he's not wrong for seeking help from management. However, if he could have resolved it without involving the CEO, maybe he should have tried that first. But if the situation persisted and was affecting his work, then reporting is a valid step.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to harassment. If the women's behavior was indeed bullying, then he's not in the wrong. If the comments were just banter and he overreacted, then maybe there's fault. But given the examples (mocking appearance, sexist remarks), those are serious and not just jokes.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because he's reporting harassment. However, some might argue he didn't handle it the best way, but the main issue is the other employees' behavior. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but with the nuance that the situation is complex.\n"
