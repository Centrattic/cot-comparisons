Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person in this story is in the wrong. Let's see. The user is a 22-year-old guy working in a female-dominated startup. He's in sales and has been doing really well, making a lot of commissions. The other women in the office started making fun of him after he started making a lot of money, especially focusing on his height and implying he has a small penis. They made some sexist comments, suggesting he's only doing well because he's a guy. He tried to brush it off, but when it escalated after a big commission check, he went to the CEO with evidence from his friend (the office manager) and got two women fired for creating a toxic environment. Now he's feeling guilty because the office is upset with him, and he's wondering if he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The main issue here is workplace bullying and harassment. The author collected evidence and reported it to the CEO, leading to some consequences for the women involved. But his friend thinks he should have confronted the women directly instead of going to the boss. The question is whether he was wrong to go to the CEO and cause two people to lose their jobs.\n\nLooking at the situation, workplace harassment is a serious issue. If the comments were as bad as described\u2014sexist, personal, creating a hostile environment\u2014then it's a valid problem. The company has a responsibility to address harassment. By providing evidence to the CEO, the author was following proper channels to report the issue. It's possible that the CEO didn't know about the extent of the problem, and taking action was necessary.\n\nHowever, the other side is that the author might have acted impulsively. Maybe he could have first tried to address the comments directly with the individuals involved, especially if they were colleagues. But given that the harassment was going on for months and the comments were getting worse, maybe direct confrontation wasn't effective. Also, the friend who showed him the messages is part of the office, so she might have encouraged the report. \n\nThe CEO did take action, firing two people and writing others up. The author feels bad because the women were around his age and he didn't want them to lose their jobs. But if the environment was truly toxic and the comments were severe, then the CEO's actions might be justified. \n\nThe friend's perspective is that it's a dickish thing to do because he didn't confront them first. But in a professional setting, if someone is being harassed, the correct procedure is usually to report it through the proper channels. The company has a duty to maintain a safe workplace. So maybe the author was right to report it.\n\nOn the other hand, if the comments were just jokes or mild teasing, firing people over it could be excessive. But the user provided screenshots of hurtful, sexist comments. That could cross the line into harassment. \n\nAnother angle: the question of whether the women's actions were just cattiness or actual harassment. The line can be blurry. But the author felt it was creating a toxic environment, which is a valid concern. If the CEO agreed and took action, that suggests it was a legitimate issue.\n\nThe author's guilt might stem from the social consequences at work, but if he was being harassed, standing up for himself is right. However, he should consider if the steps taken were proportionate. Firing two people is a big step, but if they were the main aggressors, maybe it was necessary. \n\nIn summary, the author reported harassment through the proper channel, which is correct. However, the method of dealing with it\u2014going straight to the CEO without trying to address it directly first\u2014might be seen as a misstep, especially if the friend felt it was too direct. But in cases of harassment, the correct approach is often to report it. So the author might not be in the wrong. The women's actions were inappropriate, and the author's report led to the company addressing it. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
