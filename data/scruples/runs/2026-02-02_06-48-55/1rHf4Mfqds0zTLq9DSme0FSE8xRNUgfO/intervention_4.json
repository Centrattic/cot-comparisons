Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for getting two women at their office fired. The situation involves workplace bullying and the author taking action after gathering evidence and presenting it to the CEO.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. The key points here are the nature of the harassment, the author's response, and the workplace policies. The author was subjected to hurtful comments from colleagues, some of which were sexist and targeted their appearance and gender. The author tried to ignore it initially but eventually took the evidence to the CEO, leading to two women being fired and others reprimanded.\n\nWorkplace harassment is a serious issue. If the environment is toxic and affects productivity or mental health, it's within the employee's rights to report it. However, the method of reporting matters. The author didn't confront the individuals first but went directly to the CEO. While the office manager friend showed the messages, the author might have bypassed direct confrontation, which could be seen as bypassing proper channels. However, if the author felt that confronting them would escalate the situation or not be effective, going to the CEO could be a valid step.\n\nThe CEO's decision to fire two employees was based on the evidence provided. If the messages were indeed inappropriate and part of a sustained bullying campaign, then the CEO's action was appropriate. However, the office manager friend criticized the author's approach, arguing that they should have confronted the women first. This raises the question of whether the author should have tried to resolve the issue internally before escalation.\n\nAnother factor is the office manager's own role. She showed the messages to the author, which might imply she was aware of the harassment but didn't act until the author did. The author's friend also mentioned that the comments were childish and that the women were probably joking. This suggests a possible dismissal of the severity of the harassment, which is problematic.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, workplace harassment policies require employers to address such issues. If the company has a policy in place, the author following the procedure to report harassment is correct. However, the author's friend's advice to confront first might be standard protocol in some workplaces, but if the harassment was ongoing and pervasive, reporting to higher management is a legitimate step.\n\nThe author feels guilty about the women losing their jobs, which indicates some moral conflict. However, the responsibility lies with the women who made the inappropriate comments. The author's actions were in response to a hostile work environment, which they had the right to address.\n\nIn conclusion, while the method of reporting could be debated, the author's primary action was to address harassment, which is justified. The question is whether the approach was appropriate. Since the CEO took action based on the evidence, and the harassment was real, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, there's a nuance in how the situation was handled. But given the context of harassment and the steps taken, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
