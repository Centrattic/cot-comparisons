Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting two women at his office fired. The situation is pretty detailed. The author is a 22-year-old male in a female-dominated startup environment. He's a top performer in sales, making a lot of commissions, which seems to have caused some jealousy among his female colleagues. They were spreading hurtful comments and messages about him, including some sexist remarks. The author eventually showed these messages to the CEO, leading to two of them being fired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether the author overreacted by going to the CEO directly instead of addressing the problem internally first. The office manager friend showed him the messages, and he decided to gather screenshots and confront the CEO. The CEO then took action, firing two women. The question is if the author was in the wrong.\n\nWorkplace bullying is a legitimate issue, and harassment based on gender or other protected categories is definitely not acceptable. The comments the author received included sexist remarks and personal attacks, which could be considered a hostile work environment. However, the appropriate way to handle workplace harassment is usually to follow internal procedures\u2014like speaking directly to the individuals, reporting to HR, or escalating properly. \n\nThe author skipped directly to showing the CEO, which might be seen as taking a shortcut. His friend advised him to confront them directly first, which is a common recommendation in such situations. But the author might argue that he felt unsafe or that the situation was escalating, so going to the CEO was necessary. \n\nAnother angle is the gender dynamics. The colleague's friend suggested that the author's higher commissions might be due to sexism, but the author's performance was based on results. If the commission structure is performance-based, then the higher pay is justified. However, the fact that the author is male in a female-dominated workplace and faced sexist comments adds another layer. The coworkers' comments about him making more because he's a guy could imply gender bias, but that's separate from the bullying.\n\nThe outcome was two women losing their jobs, which the author now feels guilty about. The question is whether his actions were justified. If the messages were indeed harassing and created a toxic environment, then reporting them is appropriate. But if the author didn't exhaust other options first, like direct confrontation or HR, then maybe he did overstep. \n\nThe CEO's response was to fire two and write up others. Whether that's an appropriate response depends on the severity of the messages. If they were truly harmful and part of a pattern, termination might be justified. However, if the messages were just jokes or light-hearted, firing them could be excessive. The author's friend thinks the comments shouldn't result in firings, but the author shows screenshots that were hurtful.\n\nSo, the key factors here are: 1) Did the author follow proper channels? 2) Were the comments actually harassing/harmful? 3) Was the CEO's action (firing) appropriate?\n\nIf the author went straight to the CEO without trying other steps, that could be a misstep. However, if the environment was truly toxic and the messages were severe, then reporting is necessary. The author might be in the wrong for not addressing it more directly first, but if the harassment was ongoing and he felt it wasn't being taken seriously, then his actions might be justified.\n\nAlso, considering the company's lack of proper HR processes (since they had to bring in a consultant), the CEO might have been reactive. The author's guilt might be valid if the firings were too harsh, but if the messages were truly harmful, then the CEO's action was warranted.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions could be seen as hasty, the harassment he experienced was real. The question is whether he should have handled it differently. The answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong if the harassment was severe, but the method of handling it (going straight to the CEO) could be questioned. However, given the context, it's possible that the author was justified in seeking to stop the bullying, so the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
