Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for getting two women fired at their office. The situation involves workplace bullying, reporting it, and the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is a male employee in a female-dominated startup environment. He's a top performer in sales, earning high commissions. Other female colleagues, especially some in leadership roles, started making derogatory and sexist comments about him, particularly after he achieved success. He gathered evidence, showed it to the CEO, leading to two women being fired and others written up. Now, he's feeling guilty and is being told by a friend that he acted improperly and should have addressed the issue directly instead of going to management.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. \n\nWorkplace harassment and bullying are serious issues. If someone is creating a hostile work environment through sexist comments and bullying, especially targeted at an employee's performance, that's a problem. The author had evidence of these comments, which were not just minor jokes but included personal attacks and sexism. Reporting this to the CEO was a step to address the harassment.\n\nHowever, the friend's advice suggests that confronting the individuals first might have been a better approach. But in cases of workplace harassment, it's often recommended to report it to HR or a higher authority rather than dealing with it directly, especially if the environment is hostile and the bullying is ongoing. The CEO and HR are in a position to investigate and take appropriate action.\n\nAnother angle is the claim that the women were \"probably joking.\" If the comments were indeed inappropriate and targeted, they shouldn't be dismissed as jokes. The severity of the comments (sexist, personal attacks) could justify disciplinary action. However, if the company's HR process is flawed, maybe the response was too harsh. But the CEO acted on the information given and followed procedures by involving an HR consultant.\n\nThe author's friend also mentioned that the pay disparity might be due to sexism, but the author clarified that commissions are performance-based. If that's the case, then the higher earnings are due to performance, not gender. However, the women's comments implying that the author got ahead because he's a man are themselves sexist and problematic.\n\nThe author's actions led to two firings, which he now feels guilty about. But if the workplace was indeed toxic and the comments were verified, then the CEO's actions were appropriate. The question is whether the author overstepped by escalating the issue directly. However, in many workplace policies, employees are encouraged to report harassment, so the author might not be in the wrong.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Did the author handle it the right way? Maybe he should have documented more, reported through official channels rather than showing the CEO personal messages. But given that the office manager (his friend) provided evidence, it's possible that the CEO needed that information to act. Also, the author might have felt that direct confrontation would escalate things further in a toxic environment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might feel conflicted, the actions taken were in response to harassment. The company addressed it, and the author followed proper channels. Therefore, he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, some might argue that he could have handled it differently, but the core issue of harassment is valid. So the answer is B (No).\n"
