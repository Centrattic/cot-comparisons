Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting two women at their office fired due to workplace bullying. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a 22-year-old male working in a female-dominated tech startup. He's a top performer in sales, earning high commissions. Coworkers started making fun of him, including comments about his height and appearance, and spreading sexist remarks. After a particularly big commission, he showed the CEO screenshots of the messages, leading to two women being fired and others reprimanded.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The main issue is whether the author's actions were justified. The author claims the comments were hurtful and created a toxic environment. He reported it to the CEO, leading to disciplinary action. The friend's advice suggests he should have confronted them directly first, and that the comments might have been \"joking.\"\n\nBut let's look at the content of the messages. The users described \"nasty comments,\" mockery about his height and appearance, and gender-based jealousy. These are serious issues. Workplace bullying and harassment are legitimate concerns. If the environment was toxic and affecting the author's work, reporting it is within his rights. The CEO's response was appropriate by involving HR and taking action.\n\nHowever, the author's method of handling it could be questioned. He waited until after a big commission to escalate the issue, and instead of addressing it with the individuals first, he went straight to the CEO. Some might argue that direct confrontation could have been a first step. But given the ongoing nature of the bullying and the potential for escalation, reporting to management is a standard and appropriate step.\n\nAnother angle is the possibility of sexism. The author's friend suggests that the higher commissions might be due to his gender. If the commission structure is truly performance-based, then the author's success is due to his performance. The coworkers' comments about that could be sexist, especially if they believe he's getting preferential treatment. However, the author's actions in bringing this to light might have been influenced by both legitimate bullying and potential gender bias.\n\nThe outcome was two firings and others written up. The question is whether this punishment is excessive. The author's friend thinks the comments were just \"childish\" and that getting fired is too harsh. However, if the messages constituted harassment or created a hostile work environment, the CEO was justified in taking action. The content of the messages, as described, seems to cross the line into bullying, which is not acceptable in the workplace.\n\nThe author's feelings of guilt are understandable, but he was within his rights to report the behavior. The key is whether the actions were appropriate. Reporting harassment is the right thing to do, even if it leads to difficult consequences. The author's decision to gather evidence and present it to the CEO was a reasonable approach, especially if the environment was affecting his work.\n\nIn conclusion, while there might be some debate about the best way to handle the situation, the author was not in the wrong. The coworkers were engaging in unacceptable behavior, and the author took the correct step by reporting it. The CEO's response, while leading to firings, was necessary to address a toxic work environment. The answer is B (No).\n"
