Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who submitted the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a 22-year-old male working at a female-dominated startup, who made a significant amount in commissions. His coworkers began making derogatory and sexist comments about him, which he found hurtful. After collecting evidence, he presented it to the CEO, leading to the firing of two women and written reprimands for others. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. The author was subjected to workplace bullying and sexist remarks. These comments were not just casual teasing but included personal attacks and gender-based slurs. The author's response was to gather evidence and report the behavior to the CEO. The CEO then took action, firing two employees and addressing the toxic environment.\n\nFrom a standpoint of workplace conduct, harassment and bullying are serious issues. The author had a right to report the behavior, especially if it was affecting his work environment. The company's response in firing those involved suggests the behavior was indeed inappropriate. However, the author might be in the wrong if he took matters into his own hands without exhausting other options first, like directly addressing the colleagues or using formal channels step by step. But in this case, the author did show the evidence to the CEO, which is a proper channel.\n\nThe office manager, his friend, suggested confronting them directly. While that could be a valid approach, when harassment or bullying occurs, reporting to higher management is also appropriate. The author might have felt uncomfortable confronting them directly, especially if the environment was already hostile. \n\nThe friend's comment about the comments being \"joking\" seems dismissive. The fact that the messages included sexist and personal attacks indicates that it's not just playful teasing but harmful behavior. The CEO's response was to take action, which aligns with addressing a toxic work environment.\n\nThe author's feelings of guilt over the women losing their jobs are understandable, but the actions were a response to their behavior. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the behavior was indeed bullying and the company addressed it properly, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But there's a nuance here. Did the author escalate the situation appropriately? If he had tried to resolve it without involving the CEO first, it might have been better, but given the hostile environment and the evidence, his actions were justified in seeking resolution. \n\nAnother angle is the possible sexism he experienced versus the sexism his coworker mentioned. His friend suggested that he was making more because he's a man. However, the author points out that commissions are performance-based. If the company's structure is fair, then the higher earnings are due to performance, not gender. The coworker's implication of sexism is a separate issue, but the author's response was to the bullying, not the commission disparity.\n\nIn summary, the author reported workplace bullying and harassment, which were taken seriously by the CEO. The actions led to a healthier work environment. While the author might feel guilty, the responsibility for the toxic environment lies with the coworkers, not him. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for taking appropriate steps to address the harassment.\n"
