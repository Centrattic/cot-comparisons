Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, who is a young man in a predominantly female workplace, getting two women fired after reporting their bullying behavior via the CEO. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author worked hard, achieved significant commissions, and faced negative comments from coworkers. The comments were about his appearance and insinuated sexism. When the situation escalated after a large commission, he reported the messages to the CEO, which led to two women being fired. Now he's feeling guilty because the women lost their jobs and others are upset with him.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author acted rightly by going to the CEO instead of confronting his coworkers directly. The friend suggested he should have confronted them first, but the author felt the comments were serious enough to involve upper management. \n\nWorkplace bullying is a real issue. If the comments were indeed harmful and created a hostile environment, then the author might have been justified in reporting them. However, the way he handled it could be questioned. Going to the CEO directly with evidence might be appropriate if the bullying was severe, especially if previous attempts to address it failed. However, if the author could have first tried to talk to the individuals directly and only escalated if that didn't work, that might have been a better approach. \n\nBut the author mentioned that the comments were hurtful and included sexist remarks. He might not have felt comfortable confronting them directly, especially if he's the only man in a female-dominated environment. Also, the fact that the HR employee was part of the bullying suggests that internal channels weren't reliable. \n\nThe CEO's response involved firing two employees and bringing in an HR consultant, which seems like an overreaction if the issue was just some jokes. However, the screenshots showed harassment, which could warrant disciplinary action. \n\nThe author's guilt stems from the women losing their jobs. But if the workplace culture was toxic and the comments were indeed harassment, then the author might have done the right thing to protect himself and others. However, the method of handling it without trying to resolve the issue directly first could be seen as harsh. \n\nIn some cases, direct confrontation is the first step unless the situation is immediately harmful. But harassment doesn't always require direct confrontation first. It depends on company policies. The company might have procedures for reporting such behavior, and the author might have followed those. \n\nSo, considering all factors: the presence of harassment, the severity of comments, the failure of internal channels (like HR being part of the issue), and the CEO's response, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the friend's point about confronting them directly is valid. But given the context, the author might have acted in self-defense against a hostile work environment. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there could be some responsibility for not exhausting all possible steps before escalating. However, the comments were serious enough that reporting them was necessary. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
