Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for getting two women fired at his office. The situation involves workplace bullying, performance-based commissions, and the author's response to it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author is a 22-year-old male in a predominantly female workplace. He's doing well in commissions, which are performance-based, and he's noticed that some female colleagues have been sending hurtful messages about him. When he confronts the CEO with evidence, two women are fired, and the author now feels guilty and is being criticized by his friend for not handling it directly instead of going to the CEO.\n\nNow, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's look at the possible angles. From a workplace conduct perspective, bullying and harassment are serious issues. If the women were making derogatory and sexist comments, that's a violation of company policy and workplace standards. The author's actions led to the CEO taking disciplinary action, which is appropriate. However, the method of handling it could be questioned. Did he give them a chance to address the behavior themselves first? His friend suggested confronting them directly, which might be a better approach. But if the harassment continued despite that, then reporting it is justified.\n\nAnother angle is the gender dynamics. The author feels that the women were being sexist because he's making more money as a man, even though it's performance-based. His friend also mentions that the comments about his appearance and sexuality might be rooted in sexism. The author's friend argues that the comments were childish and not serious enough for termination. However, the screenshots show explicit bullying, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe author's friend suggests that he should have handled it differently, but the key issue is whether the behavior was indeed harassment. If the company has a zero-tolerance policy, then firing the employees might be appropriate. However, if the author bypassed the proper channels or didn't give the employees a chance to correct their behavior, that could be a point against him.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is important. He was motivated by the negative comments and the toxic environment, which is understandable. But the decision to escalate to the CEO without prior direct confrontation could be seen as a misstep. However, if the messages were ongoing and he felt uncomfortable confronting them directly, then reporting is a valid action.\n\nThe ethical question here is whether the author's actions were proportionate. Firing two employees based on messages might be a heavy punishment, but if those messages were part of a broader toxic environment, it's a necessary step. The CEO's response seems appropriate given the evidence presented.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have acted impulsively and could have tried to address the issue directly first, the behavior of the colleagues was indeed inappropriate. The firing might have been the company's decision, but the author's approach could be seen as a valid response to harassment. However, the method of handling it without direct confrontation first might be where he's in the wrong. But given the context of harassment, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the answer would depend on whether the company's policies support such actions and if the author followed proper procedures. Since he went to the CEO after gathering evidence, it's a bit justified, but there's room for argument that he didn't handle it the best way possible.\n"
