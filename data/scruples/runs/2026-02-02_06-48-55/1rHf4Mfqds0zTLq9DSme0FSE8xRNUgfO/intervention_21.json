Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for getting two women at their office fired because they sent hurtful messages about him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is a 22-year-old sales rep who started part-time and then full-time, making a lot in commissions. The office is mostly women, and some of them started sending him messages with sexist and catty comments after he outperformed them. He showed these messages to the CEO, leading to the firing of two women and others being written up. Now he's feeling guilty and the office is against him.\n\nThe key points here are: were the messages from the women actual harassment or just workplace banter? The author claims they were making fun of his appearance and suggesting he was paid more because he's a man. If these messages were indeed bullying or created a hostile work environment, then the CEO had a duty to address it. But if the messages were just jokes, maybe the author overreacted.\n\nAlso, the office manager friend showed him the messages, so he wasn't just making it up. The CEO was shocked and took action, which suggests the messages were serious. The author did go to the CEO directly with evidence, which is the right step. However, the friend advised him to confront them first, but that might not always be necessary if the harassment is severe.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting the harassment. If the messages were indeed inappropriate and created a toxic environment, then the author did the right thing. But if the messages were just harmless teasing, then maybe he overreacted. The line between workplace teasing and harassment can be blurry. Since the CEO acted on it, it seems like the behavior crossed that line. However, the author might have escalated too quickly without trying to resolve it internally first, but in cases of harassment, reporting to higher-ups is often the correct course of action.\n\nThe author's friend thinks it's sexist that he makes more, but the commissions are performance-based. That's a separate issue. The main issue is the workplace bullying. So the author isn't wrong for seeking resolution, but maybe the outcome (firing two people) was disproportionate. However, the CEO decided to take that action based on the evidence provided. The author's intention was to stop the bullying, which is valid. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because he reported serious misconduct. The women's actions were inappropriate, and he took the correct steps to address it. The guilt might stem from feeling like a traitor, but he wasn't the aggressor. So the answer should be B, not in the wrong.\n"
