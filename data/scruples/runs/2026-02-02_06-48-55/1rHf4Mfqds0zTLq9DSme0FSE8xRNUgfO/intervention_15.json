Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting two women at his office fired. The scenario involves workplace bullying, performance-based commissions, and the author taking the matter to the CEO.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of the author's actions. He was subjected to hurtful comments from coworkers, which were shared with him by his friend, the office manager. The comments were about his appearance and implied sexism. He tried to brush them off initially but eventually went to the CEO with evidence (screenshots). The CEO then fired two women and wrote others up. The author now feels guilty because he's the office pariah and his friend thinks he acted too harshly.\n\nThe key points here are: the nature of the comments, the appropriateness of the action taken, and whether the author handled it correctly. The comments were reportedly offensive and targeted. If they were indeed derogatory and unprofessional, then the behavior is problematic. However, the author didn't confront the individuals directly first. His friend suggested confronting them, but he went straight to the CEO. That could be seen as bypassing proper channels. However, if the environment was toxic and ongoing, maybe direct confrontation wasn't effective. The CEO's response\u2014firing two and writing up others\u2014could be a proportionate response to a hostile work environment. \n\nBut there's a nuance. The author's friend argues that the comments were \"childish\" and maybe not severe enough for termination. However, the author provided evidence of repeated bullying, which could be grounds for disciplinary action. The question is whether the punishment was too harsh. Also, the fact that the author is a man in a female-dominated workplace and was making more in commissions might have influenced perceptions. His friend suggested sexism, but the author's high performance might justify the commissions. The author's actions were aimed at stopping the harassment, but perhaps the outcome was too severe, leading to his isolation.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author faced harassment and took steps to address it. However, the method might have been flawed. He didn't confront the individuals first, which could have resolved the issue without firing people. The CEO's decision might have been appropriate, but the author's role in initiating it could be seen as overstepping if the punishment was too harsh. Alternatively, if the workplace culture was toxic and the CEO acted responsibly, the author isn't entirely at fault. It's a bit of a gray area. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to balance both sides. The key is whether the author's action was the right approach. Since he went to the CEO directly, maybe he was justified, but the outcome caused harm. So, the answer depends on whether the action was necessary and proportionate. Given the evidence he had and the CEO's role, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the friend's perspective adds complexity. Hmm, tricky. I lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't handle it directly first and the consequences were severe, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the workplace was truly toxic, maybe he's not. The answer hinges on whether the punishment was too harsh. If the comments were severe enough, then maybe not. But if they were just \"jokes,\" then maybe yes. The screenshots he provided might show serious issues, so maybe he's not at fault. I'm conflicted but leaning towards A because of the direct confrontation missing and the friend's valid points.\n"
