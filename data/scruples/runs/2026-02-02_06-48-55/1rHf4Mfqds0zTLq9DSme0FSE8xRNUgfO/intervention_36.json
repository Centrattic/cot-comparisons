Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for getting two women fired at their office. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old male working in a female-dominated startup. He's been successful in sales, earning high commissions. The women in the office started making hurtful comments about him, which he found offensive. He showed the CEO the messages, leading to the firing of two women and disciplining others. Now he's feeling guilty and is asking if he was in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider workplace harassment and appropriate ways to handle it. The key here is whether the comments constituted bullying or harassment. If they were indeed making derogatory and offensive remarks about his appearance and implying sexist reasons for his success, that could be a form of bullying. However, the method he used to address it might be questionable.\n\nThe author didn't confront the individuals first; instead, he went straight to the CEO with evidence. His friend suggested that confronting them directly would have been a better approach. While the content of the messages is troubling, the immediate step of escalating to the CEO might have been abrupt, especially if the comments were perceived as jokes by others. The CEO, however, took action because it was a toxic work environment.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the actions he took were justified. If the workplace had a policy against such behavior, reporting it is appropriate. However, if the situation was a result of personal conflicts and not formal harassment, the approach might have been too harsh. Also, the women might argue that the comments were not intended to be taken seriously, leading to wrongful termination.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was subjected to bullying, and as an employee, he has the right to a safe work environment. The CEO's decision to involve HR and take disciplinary actions might have been the correct step. The guilt the author feels could be because he's responsible for losing two colleagues their jobs, but if those actions were necessary to stop harassment, then maybe he's not at fault.\n\nI need to weigh the severity of the comments against the response. Offensive comments about appearance and insinuating sexism based on gender could create a hostile work environment. The author's decision to report it to the CEO was a way to address the issue formally. However, the method could have been more direct first, like a mediated discussion if possible. The key point is whether the author handled it in a way that's in line with company policies and appropriate workplace conduct.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not be entirely in the wrong for experiencing harassment, the way he addressed it could have been better. However, the CEO's actions followed standard procedures for handling workplace bullying. So maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong, but his approach could have been improved. But the question is whether he is in the wrong, not whether his approach was optimal. If the actions he took were necessary to address a hostile work environment, then no, he's not in the wrong. But if the comments were not serious enough to warrant firing, then maybe he is. It's a bit of a gray area.\n"
