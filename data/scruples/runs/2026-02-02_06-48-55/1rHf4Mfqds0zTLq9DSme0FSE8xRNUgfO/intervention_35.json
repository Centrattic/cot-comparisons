Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a young man who reported his female coworkers for bullying him with hurtful comments and spreading negativity, which led to two of them getting fired. The user is asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the comments were about his height, appearance, and implied things about his masculinity. These are indeed hurtful, and workplace bullying is a serious issue. However, the way he handled it might be questionable. \n\nHe didn't confront them directly as his friend suggested. Instead, he went straight to the CEO with screenshots and evidence. While the company has a policy against harassment, the question is whether his approach was appropriate. The CEO had to take action, but firing two people might be a heavy response, especially if the comments were part of a toxic environment rather than malicious intent. \n\nThe friend's arguments are that he should have addressed it directly first and that the comments about making more money could be a form of sexism. The author might have felt justified, but the method of escalation without prior discussion could contribute to the problem. Also, the fact that it's a small office with mostly women and the CEO being a man might add layers of complexity, like potential gender dynamics at play.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was experiencing a hostile work environment, which is not acceptable. The company's response to create a toxic environment suggests they had existing issues. But the author's actions contributed to the firing of two people, which he now feels bad about. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he had a direct complaint about harassment, he's in the right to report it. However, if the comments were more teasing or part of a catty culture without being truly malicious, maybe he overreacted. The key is whether the comments crossed the line into harassment. The author's friend thinks the comments were just childish, but the author found them hurtful. Workplace policies usually require addressing harassment through proper channels, which he did. \n\nBut maybe the author should have tried to resolve it internally first. The line between workplace bullying and office banter can be thin. If the comments were not malicious, firing people might be too harsh. However, if they were indeed part of a pattern of bullying, then the CEO's action was appropriate. \n\nIn conclusion, there are two sides. The author had a right to report harassment, but perhaps handled it without trying to resolve it directly first. However, the company's response might have been too severe if the women were just being catty. The answer hinges on whether the comments were harassment or just office banter. Given the information, it's a bit of both. The author isn't entirely wrong for reporting, but maybe could have approached it differently. But the main issue is the company's response. However, since the question is about the author's accountability, I think he might be in the wrong because he escalated without trying direct confrontation first, and perhaps overreacted to the comments, leading to losing colleagues. So, the answer might be A.\n"
