Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a young male salesperson in a female-dominated startup, getting two women fired after they were spreading toxic and sexist comments about him. The author provided screenshots of these messages to the CEO, leading to the women being fired.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author acted unethically. The key points here are the nature of the comments, the method of addressing the issue, and the consequences. The comments from coworkers included sexist remarks about his appearance and implied that his success was due to his gender rather than performance. That's definitely workplace bullying and harassment, which is unacceptable. \n\nHowever, the author's approach was to go straight to the CEO with evidence, bypassing direct confrontation. The office manager had already shared the messages, which suggests the author wasn't entirely out of the loop. But confronting the individuals first might have been a better step to address the issue without immediate escalation. The friend's advice to confront them directly is valid because sometimes direct communication can resolve misunderstandings or stop the behavior before it escalates.\n\nOn the other hand, the comments were severe enough to create a hostile work environment. The author had tried to brush them off initially, but when the harassment continued and intensified, seeking help from the CEO was a reasonable step to protect himself. The CEO did take appropriate action by firing two employees and involving HR, which aligns with standard workplace procedures for handling harassment.\n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author's motivation might be questioned. He was the top performer, and the comments from coworkers were partly about his success. The friend suggested that there's an element of sexism regarding his higher earnings, which the author might not have considered. If the workplace culture was already biased against men, the author's actions could be seen as a defensive move in a skewed environment.\n\nHowever, the core issue is that the women engaged in bullying and harassment, which is a serious violation of workplace conduct. The author had a right to report this behavior. The question is whether he went too far by causing two people to lose their jobs. While the behavior was bad, the response of firing them might be seen as disproportionate, especially if the comments were considered more of a joke or if there was a lack of prior warnings. The author's friend argued that the comments shouldn't lead to termination, which complicates the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author faced harassment and took action to address it. While going to the CEO directly might not have been the first step, the behavior he reported was unacceptable, and the CEO's decision to fire two employees was based on their actions. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because he was protecting himself from a hostile work environment. However, the outcome caused significant consequences for others, which makes it a gray area. The answer might depend on whether the harassment was clear and the appropriate steps were taken.\n"
