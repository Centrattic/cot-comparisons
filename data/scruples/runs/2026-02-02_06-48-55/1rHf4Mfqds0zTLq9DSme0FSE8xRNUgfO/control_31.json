Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a young man, got two women fired from his office because they were bullying him. The company is mostly women, and after he started making a lot of money in commissions, some of them started sending him mean messages. He showed these messages to the CEO, who then fired two people and reprimanded others. Now the author is feeling guilty and asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author says the women were making fun of his appearance and commenting on his gender, like implying he made more because he's a guy. He collected evidence, went to the CEO, and got two fired. His friend thinks he was too harsh and that he should have confronted them first. The question is whether he did something wrong.\n\nSo, let's break it down. Workplace bullying is a serious issue. If someone is creating a hostile work environment through harassment or bullying, that's not acceptable. The author had evidence in the form of screenshots, which he presented. The CEO agreed it was bullying and took action. On the flip side, some might argue that the author didn't address the issue directly first, jumping straight to the CEO. Also, maybe the comments were more teasing than malicious, and the punishment was too severe.\n\nBut the author mentions that the comments were hurtful and included sexist remarks. Performance-based commissions shouldn't be gender-based, so if they were implying he got better leads because he's a guy, that's a problem. Also, the CEO took it seriously, so maybe the actions were justified. However, the author's friend thinks it's childish and that the women were just joking. That complicates things. If the messages were in poor taste but not outright hostile, firing them might be excessive.\n\nAnother angle: the author is male in a female-dominated workplace, which might add a layer of gender dynamics. The friend also suggests it's sexism that he makes more, even though it's performance-based. If the author's success led to resentment, maybe the women's reactions were due to that, not just his gender. But the comments about his gender and appearance could still be part of a pattern of harassment.\n\nThe main ethical question is whether the author handled it the right way. Was going to the CEO immediately the right move, or should he have tried to resolve it internally first? Also, whether the punishment was appropriate. The CEO decided to fire two, but maybe the author should have been more involved in that decision.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if the workplace was indeed toxic and the comments were hostile, then the author wasn't in the wrong for seeking help. However, if the comments were just jokes and the author overreacted, then he might be at fault. The line between teasing and harassment is often blurry. The presence of evidence (screenshots) supports his claims, but the friend's perspective that it's childish and shouldn't lead to firings adds another layer.\n\nI think the key points are: the existence of bullying, the steps taken to report it, and the proportionality of the response. If the CEO agreed it was a toxic environment, then the action was justified. However, the author's role in escalating it quickly without prior communication might be seen as a misstep. But if the environment was already hostile and he felt unsafe, then it's understandable. The answer could hinge on whether the actions were necessary and proportionate.\n"
