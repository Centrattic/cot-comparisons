Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 22-year-old male working in a female-dominated startup, faced bullying from female coworkers after he started performing exceptionally well in sales. He got a lot of commissions, which made some women resent him. They were sending mean messages, making fun of his appearance, and accusing him of getting preferential treatment because he's a guy. When he went to the CEO with evidence, two women got fired and the rest were written up. Now, he's feeling guilty and wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken by the author. He gathered evidence of the bullying and reported it to the CEO. The CEO then took disciplinary action, firing two and writing up others. The author's friend thinks he should have confronted them directly instead of going to the CEO. The question is whether the author did the right thing or if he was too harsh.\n\nOn one hand, workplace bullying is serious and should be addressed. The messages included personal attacks and sexism, which are not acceptable. The author felt harassed and chose to report it, which is the proper channel. The CEO's decision to fire two employees might have been because their behavior was severe and persistent, creating a toxic environment. The author's actions led to a resolution, even if it resulted in job loss for some.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's friend argues that confronting the coworkers directly first would have been better. But if the bullying was ongoing and the messages were as bad as described (like personal attacks on height and making fun of appearance), confronting them might not have been effective. The coworkers weren't just joking but were engaged in serious harassment. Also, the author's friend mentioned that the situation might involve sexism, which complicates things. However, the author did take the issue to the proper authority rather than handling it through personal confrontation.\n\nAnother point is the possibility of overreaction. Were the messages really that bad? The user described them as \"nasty comments,\" \"hurtful,\" and including personal attacks. If those messages were not just teasing but actual harassment, then reporting them is justified. However, if the comments were minor and the author escalated it too quickly, maybe there's a case against him. But given the context that it was ongoing, after multiple instances, and the CEO was unaware, it seems the author had a valid reason to report.\n\nThe friend's perspective is that the author should have talked to the women first. But in a professional setting, especially when the behavior is affecting the work environment, going to HR or the CEO is a standard procedure. Direct confrontation might not be safe or effective if the bullies are multiple and the situation is toxic. The author's actions led to a resolution, even if it caused some to lose their jobs. However, the author feels bad about it, which shows he's considering the consequences.\n\nIn terms of workplace policies, the CEO did reach out to an HR consultant, which suggests that the company is taking the issue seriously. The fact that the CEO acted after being informed by the author indicates that the problem was significant enough to warrant disciplinary action.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author reported workplace bullying that he experienced, which included personal and sexist comments. He took the appropriate steps by gathering evidence and reporting to the CEO. While the outcome led to job losses, the actions were in response to a hostile work environment. The author's friend's opinion is that he should have confronted them first, but in a professional context, going to management is the correct procedure. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. However, there's a nuance in whether the comments were truly actionable harassment or just office banter taken too far. The line between workplace harassment and personality clashes can be thin here. But given the descriptions of the messages, it's plausible that the author was justified. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
