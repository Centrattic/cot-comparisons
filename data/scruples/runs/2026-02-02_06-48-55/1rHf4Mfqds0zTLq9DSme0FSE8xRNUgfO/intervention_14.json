Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting two women at his office fired. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a male sales rep in a mostly female startup company. He started doing exceptionally well, earning high commissions. The other female employees started sending him negative messages, making fun of his appearance and implying sexism. When he took the evidence to the CEO, two women were fired, and others were written up. Now the author feels guilty and is questioning if he did the right thing.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are: workplace conduct, appropriate responses to bullying, and the use of authority to take action. The author claims he showed the CEO screenshots of the messages, which were offensive. The CEO deemed it workplace bullying and took action, firing two employees. \n\nThe user's friend suggested that the author should have confronted the women directly first. But in some cases, especially where there's a hostile work environment, reporting to higher-ups is the correct step. However, the author didn't try to address the issue directly first. Instead, he went straight to the CEO with evidence. \n\nBut the messages were pretty bad\u2014sexist, personal attacks based on gender (like comments about his height and implying he has a small penis because he's short). The fact that the other employees were making these comments under the guise of \"jokes\" but it was clearly toxic. The CEO had a responsibility to address it, and the author brought it to his attention. \n\nHowever, the author's actions led to losing colleagues and a hostile work environment. The key question is whether escalating to the CEO directly was the appropriate step. The company's HR procedures might have a protocol for such issues. If the company has a process for reporting harassment, following that is correct. But if the author bypassed any informal resolution steps, that could be seen as a misstep. \n\nAlso, the friend's argument that the author's high commission might be due to gender bias is a potential factor. If the commission structure is truly performance-based, then the author's success is on his merits. However, if the workplace is accusing him of getting better leads, there might be underlying issues of sexism that need addressing. \n\nIn terms of corporate policy, if the company has a policy against workplace bullying, the author was right to report it. However, the decision to fire two employees might be seen as harsh unless there were prior warnings. The CEO's role is to enforce policies, so if the evidence was clear and the behavior was against company standards, firing them is justified. But the author's role in providing the evidence is a gray area. Did he have the right to escalate without trying to resolve it internally first?\n\nOn the other hand, if the author was experiencing a hostile work environment, he had a right to report it. The problem is that by taking screenshots and presenting them directly, he might have bypassed some steps, but given the severity of the messages, it could be justified. The company's response seems appropriate once they were informed.\n\nSo, the author's actions might not be in the wrong because he reported legitimate harassment. However, the method of reporting could have been better. The answer hinges on whether the actions taken were proportionate and followed proper procedures. If the author followed the correct reporting channels, then he's not in the wrong. If he went over others' heads without trying to resolve it first, that could be a flaw. \n\nBut given the information, the author took the issue to the CEO with evidence, and the CEO acted. The key is whether the messages constituted harassment. If they did, then the author was right to report. However, the author might have contributed to the toxic environment by focusing on commissions and possibly being perceived as getting preferential treatment. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions were to address harassment, the method and consequences (firing people) might have been handled differently. The answer could be that the author is not in the wrong because he reported legitimate harassment, but there's a case for him being in the wrong if he didn't handle it through proper channels. But given the severity of the messages, escalating to the CEO was appropriate. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
