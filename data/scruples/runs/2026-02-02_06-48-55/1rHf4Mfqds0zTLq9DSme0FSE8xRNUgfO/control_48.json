Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a male sales rep in a mostly female startup company. He's been doing really well with his commissions, which are performance-based. The other women in the office started making negative and sexist comments about him, especially after he made a lot of money. He showed the CEO screenshots of these messages, leading to two women being fired and others written up. Now he's feeling like an asshole because the office dynamics have changed, and his friend thinks he was too harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Workplace bullying is a serious issue. The author was being targeted with hurtful comments, including sexist remarks. Even if the women were \"joking,\" the comments were inappropriate and created a hostile environment. The author's job performance is tied to commissions, which are based on results, not gender. The CEO didn't know about the bullying beforehand, so the author bringing it up wasn't about jealousy but about addressing a toxic situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't confront the individuals directly first. His friend suggested that he should have talked to the women directly to resolve the issue. Bypassing that step and going straight to the CEO could be seen as not giving them a chance to correct their behavior. But maybe in a work environment where the CEO is in on the situation, the author felt it was the only way to get action. Also, the friend who's the office manager showed him the messages, which might mean that she was involved in documenting the bullying.\n\nThe problem is whether the author's actions were justified. The messages he shared with the CEO were clearly bullying, so reporting them to address a toxic environment could be seen as right. However, the outcome was two women losing their jobs. The CEO might have overreacted, but that's the company's responsibility. The author's role was to report harassment, which is a standard procedure in many workplaces. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently. The friend's advice to confront them directly is a common approach in conflict resolution. However, the author might not have felt safe doing that, especially if the comments were spreading and people were turning against him. Also, the friend later changed her stance, saying the women shouldn't have been fired because of \"childish comments.\" That's a bit confusing because if the comments were indeed harassment, they shouldn't be dismissed as just jokes.\n\nThe author's intention was to stop the bullying, which is a valid reason. The actions taken by the CEO (firing two and sending the rest a warning email) might be appropriate if the harassment was severe. The author didn't take any action himself beyond reporting; he didn't personally fire them, so his responsibility is in reporting. The question is whether he did something wrong by not addressing it directly first. While it's ideal to give people a chance to fix their behavior, in cases of harassment, especially when it's ongoing and not just one incident, going to HR or a higher authority is the correct step. So the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut there's another angle: the friend, who's the office manager, showed him the messages. Maybe she should have handled it herself as part of her role. However, the author might not have known to whom to report if HR was complicit (since one of the HR girls is involved). The CEO being the main male leader might be the right person to approach, especially if he's aware of the performance-based pay. \n\nIn conclusion, the author reported harassment, which is a serious issue. While he didn't confront the women first, his action was to stop a toxic environment. The friend's advice might not be the best in this case. The author isn't in the wrong because he took appropriate steps to address the bullying. The women were at fault for their behavior, and the CEO's decision to fire some is the company's call. So answer B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
