Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author did the wrong thing by getting two women fired at his office. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old male working in a female-dominated startup. He's a top performer in sales, making high commissions. The other female employees have been making fun of him for his appearance and accusing him of getting his commissions through being a guy, not performance. The author collected evidence of their bullying, showed it to the CEO, leading to two women being fired and others written up. Now he's feeling guilty and asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about workplace bullying, appropriate responses, and whether the author's actions were justified. The author claims the comments were hurtful and that the women were spreading malicious messages. He took the evidence to the CEO instead of confronting them directly, as his friend suggested. The friend thinks he was too harsh, saying the women shouldn't have been fired for \"childish comments.\"\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author was a victim of bullying and harassment, which is not acceptable in the workplace. The comments about his appearance and the sexist accusations are definitely not okay. It's important to address such behavior, and the CEO did take action. However, the author's approach was to go straight to the CEO with evidence leading to firings, which might be seen as heavy-handed. The friend's advice to confront them first makes sense because it's often better to address the issue directly before escalating. But in a hostile work environment, direct confrontation might not be safe or effective. \n\nThen there's the question of whether the punishments were appropriate. Firing two employees for what the author's friend called \"childish comments\" could be excessive unless the comments were severe or persistent. The author shows screenshots of the messages, which include hurtful and possibly offensive remarks. The line between workplace banter and harassment is a thin one. If the comments crossed that line and created a toxic environment, the CEO's action was necessary. However, if the company's HR policies didn't cover such behavior, the CEO might have overstepped.\n\nAnother angle is the author's own actions. He's a top earner, and there's a possibility that the women's jealousy played a role. The author's friend mentioned that the author might be experiencing sexism because he's making more than the women. However, the author states that commissions are performance-based. If that's the case, then the pay difference is justified, but the women's comments about him being a guy could be sexist. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? He took a strong stance against bullying, which is good, but the method might have been problematic. By immediately going to the CEO and providing evidence, he might have bypassed proper channels (like HR or internal reporting systems), but in a startup with a close-knit team, that might be the only option. The CEO did take action, but firing two employees could be seen as extreme, especially if the company didn't have clear policies in place. The author might have contributed to the conflict by not trying to resolve it internally first. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were aimed at stopping harassment, which is right, but the approach and the outcome might be questionable. The answer might depend on whether the company's policies and the severity of the comments warranted such punishment. But considering the author's intent to stop bullying and the CEO's role in addressing it, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the way he handled it could have been better, leading to him feeling guilty. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). I think the key here is whether the author should have addressed it differently. If the company's HR procedures were followed, maybe he's okay. But if he went over their heads without trying to resolve it first, then maybe A. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just handling it poorly. Since the bullying was real and the CEO acted, the author might not be in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
