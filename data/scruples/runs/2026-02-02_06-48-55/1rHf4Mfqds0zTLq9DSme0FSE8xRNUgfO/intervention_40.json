Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 22-year-old male working in a female-dominated tech startup, made a lot of money through commissions and faced some negative comments from his female colleagues. He then went to the CEO with evidence of their messages, leading to two women being fired. Now, he's feeling guilty and asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The colleagues were spreading hurtful comments about him, including sexist remarks about his appearance and performance. He didn't confront them directly but instead showed the CEO the messages, which resulted in two people being fired. His friend criticized him for not handling it directly and suggested that the comments were just jokes.\n\nFrom a workplace bullying perspective, the comments he received seem inappropriate and unprofessional. If they were true and part of a hostile work environment, the CEO had a duty to address it. However, the author's approach might be questionable. Instead of confronting the individuals or using company HR channels first, he went straight to the CEO with the evidence, which could have been a more direct route. Also, getting two people fired might be seen as harsh if the CEO didn't fully understand the context or if the evidence was taken out of context.\n\nAnother angle is the issue of sexism mentioned by his friend. Even if the author made more money, if the colleagues were implying that his success was due to being male rather than performance, that's a valid concern. However, the author's response to this by exposing the messages might be justified if the environment was truly toxic.\n\nBut the author's actions did lead to the loss of two jobs. Even if the colleagues were at fault, the outcome is significant. The question is whether the author took the appropriate steps. In many workplaces, the standard procedure is to address the issue directly with the individuals involved, then escalate if necessary. By bypassing that step, the author might have contributed to a more severe consequence than necessary.\n\nAdditionally, the colleague's friend raised a point about the messages possibly being jokes. If the messages were indeed taken out of context or were just teasing, then the author might have overreacted. However, if the messages were genuinely offensive and part of a pattern of bullying, then the author's action was a legitimate step to protect himself and improve the work environment.\n\nThe CEO's responsibility to maintain a respectful workplace is key here. If the CEO was unaware and the author provided valid evidence, then the CEO's decision to act could be appropriate. However, the author's role in escalating the issue might have been the correct move if the environment was toxic and unmanageable otherwise.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions might be seen as justified if the workplace was truly hostile and he didn't have the support to address it directly. However, the method of handling it (going straight to the CEO without prior confrontation) could be seen as a misstep. The outcome of two people losing their jobs is severe, and the author's guilt might be valid if the colleagues' actions were not as malicious as presented. So, there's a balance here between self-preservation and the appropriateness of the response.\n"
