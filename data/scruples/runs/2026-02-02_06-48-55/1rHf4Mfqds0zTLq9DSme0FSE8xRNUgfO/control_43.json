Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting two women fired at his office because they were bullying him with messages about his height and commissions. The author, a 22-year-old male, works in a female-dominated office and faced cattiness after outperforming others. He showed the CEO the messages, leading to two women being fired and others written up. Now he's feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace harassment laws. If the messages were indeed hostile or created a toxic environment, the company has a duty to address it. However, the approach matters. The author didn't confront the women first; he went straight to the CEO. That might be a problem because the appropriate step is usually to address the issue directly with the involved parties or follow a formal process. \n\nBut then again, if the harassment was serious and ongoing, employees have the right to report it to management. The question is whether the messages were severe enough to warrant termination. The examples given (jokes about height, comments on his appearance) might be considered workplace bullying, but firing someone for that could be seen as a harsh response unless there was a prior history or company policy against such behavior.\n\nAlso, the author's friend suggests that the comments were \"childish\" and maybe not a firing offense. The author's friend also mentioned possible sexism, as he was making more due to performance, but others accused him of getting better leads. That could imply there's a valid concern about equity, which complicates things.\n\nThe key points are: Did the author handle the situation appropriately by going to the CEO directly? Was the CEO's response (firing two people) justified based on the evidence? Is the author at fault for reporting harassment, or is the company responsible for enforcing their policies?\n\nIt's a tricky situation. On one hand, the author had a right to report harassment. On the other hand, the response might have been too severe if the messages weren't malicious enough for termination. The company's HR policies and the nature of the messages would determine that. Since the user is asking for an AITA (Am I the Asshole) perspective, the community often considers intent and proportionality.\n\nThe author's actions led to losing colleagues, and he feels guilty. His friend's criticism is valid in that confronting the women first might have been better. However, if the harassment was ongoing and the company's policy allows reporting directly, he wasn't necessarily wrong. The outcome (firing two employees over messages) might be seen as harsh, so the employer's decision could be questioned, but the employee's right to report remains valid.\n\nIn the end, the author might not be in the wrong for reporting harassment, but the consequences (firing two people) might not have been his intention. However, he could be seen as not handling it the best way. But since harassment is a serious issue, he's not entirely at fault. The answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because he reported legitimate concerns, but there's a gray area.\n"
