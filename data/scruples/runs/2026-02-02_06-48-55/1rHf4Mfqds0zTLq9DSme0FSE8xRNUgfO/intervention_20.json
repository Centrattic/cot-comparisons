Which basically means I close deals and get a commission from said closed deals + a base salary. Honestly its a very lucrative career and I recommend looking into it if you want a career change or looking for a high risk high reward career.\n\nThis software company that I work at is a start up so its mostly people in their 20's, here's the thing though its all women. The software devs, engineers, customer outreach, interns, HR and other people in sales, exec team is all women. The CEO is a man though an amazing guy, really at the forefront of tech with this product and its actually fairly easy to sell their software products as a lot of businesses need them. Other than us 2 dudes its all women, I have no problem with this at all. They are all qualified and do great work, however there is one thing I can't get over. Their cattiness and bitchyness especially after they found out I was making a killing in commissions.\n\nMy first month in June I pulled in about 10k in commissions, highest anyone there has pulled in to date. I started hearing stuff around the office about it and people were congratulating me etc. But also I got some who were not happy I was making that much, especially 1 woman who is the CTO, HR girl and the other 2 women on my sales team. I have one friend at work and she's the office manager and she showed me the messages the other girls in the office have been sending to her. And honestly its fucking hurtful, a lot were making fun of me being short, I must have a small dick (LOL) and my appearance. Some were saying how I'm making more because I'm a guy, even though commissions are performance based and just nasty comments. I didn't care too much as I've heard that shit all before and I'm ok with my height I guess.\n\nI brushed this all off and when we talk in the office they are all nice and we are professional to me, this has been going on since the summer and I've been killing every month since. I got my own office, while they work in cubes and have a lot of freedom since I'm doing well. December was an amazing month due to a lot of businesses wanting to buy our product now and get in on their books for the 2018 year. All the sales people did very well, but I grinded almost 7 days a week 10 hrs a day closing deals and I got a huge commission cheque that I just got today. It was around 45k, before tax which is so fucking crazy but of course I expected it because of how many deals I closed. As expected, the HR girl told everyone I made that much in commission and they were all shitting on me claiming sexism saying I got better leads to close than them ETC and just being nasty. My friend the office manager girl showed me these messages and I couldn't take it anymore, I asked for screenshots from all the nasty stuff they've said about me since June and I went into our CEO's office and said hey can we grab a quick coffee I need to talk with you. He said sure as he wanted to talk anyways about my great month In Dec and congratulate me. We sit down at a cafe and I get straight to the point and showed him everything and tell him whats been going on. He is shocked and said he had no idea this was happening and said that this was workplace bullying and should not be tolerated, but he didn't know what to do. He couldn't fire all the women for this, but I did want one girl who was the most cruel in the messages to get canned. He said he agreed she should be let go for this.\n\nWhen he got back to the office he immediately called in a few of the women and fired 2 of them, and wrote the rest up for creating a toxic work environment. He also sent a mass email out saying that he has contacted an HR consultant who will be coming in next week to talk with us and review our policies. But now I'm the office pariah basically, no one said bye to me at the end of the day like they usually do and I was getting nasty looks all afternoon. I love working here as the money is great and everyone is nice to my face but I feel like such an asshole for some reason, I've never complained about someone like this before and I feel bad about 2 women around my age losing their jobs. I spoke to my friend about this after work and she said it was extremely a dickish thing to do as I should have confronted them directly to tell them to stop instead of running to the boss. Also she said she does think its sexism that I was making so much more than the other women in the office even its performance based. Also said something about how childish comments really shouldn't get them fired as they were probably joking. Even though I showed her the screenshots and they were of them saying really hurtful things that I'd never say to another person.\n\nAITA for this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting two women fired at their office. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author is a young male employee in a female-dominated startup. He's been successful in sales, making a lot of commissions, which has led to some coworkers being resentful and making hurtful comments about him. He confronted the CEO with evidence of their messages, leading to the firing of two women and disciplinary actions. Now he's feeling guilty and questions if he did the right thing.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are: Is the author justified in his actions, or did he overstep? The key here is whether the coworkers' behavior was actually inappropriate and whether the author handled it correctly.\n\nThe coworkers were making derogatory comments based on his gender and appearance. The author claims that commissions are performance-based, but others are suggesting he's getting preferential treatment. The messages included sexist remarks and personal jabs. The CEO, after being shown the evidence, took action because it was considered workplace bullying and a toxic environment.\n\nNow, the author's friend advised him to confront the women directly first, rather than going to the CEO. The question is whether bypassing direct confrontation is a mistake. However, workplace policies often allow for reporting harassment or bullying directly to higher-ups or HR without prior confrontation, especially if the employee feels unsafe or the behavior is persistent.\n\nThe women were terminated for creating a toxic environment, which the CEO deemed unacceptable. The author might be feeling guilty because he's aware of the impact on the women's jobs, but if the behavior was indeed bullying, then the company's actions were appropriate. The friend's suggestion that the comments were \"childish\" and not serious enough for firing might downplay the severity of harassment, even if the intent was to joke.\n\nOn the other hand, there's the aspect of the author possibly using the situation to address his own feelings of being unfairly treated. If the company's commission structure is truly performance-based, then the women's resentment based on his gender could indicate underlying sexism in the workplace, which the CEO is addressing by involving HR consultants.\n\nHowever, the author did take the matter to the CEO with evidence, which is a legitimate step in many workplaces for reporting harassment. The CEO's response seems proportional given that multiple people were involved and the environment was toxic.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong if the coworkers' actions were indeed bullying and the company's response was appropriate. The key factors are whether the behavior crossed into harassment and if the author followed the correct procedures. The friend's advice to confront first might be valid in some cases, but if the situation was already pervasive and harmful, reporting it directly is a reasonable step. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
