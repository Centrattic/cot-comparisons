She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for white-lie about masturbating to their girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend has trust issues from being cheated on in the past. They're in a seven-month relationship, and she's staying over five nights a week. The author masturbated once while she was away on a trip. When asked, they lied about when it happened, first saying \"a while\" and then \"a few weeks,\" before admitting it was recently. The GF is upset, equating the lie to potential cheating, and has left.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the situation, the key points are white-lie, trust issues, and the girlfriend's reaction. The author's intention was to avoid conflict based on her past reactions. But lying, even a white lie, can erode trust, especially in a relationship where trust is already delicate. The GF's perspective is that any lie could indicate bigger issues, like cheating. \n\nThe author's apology wasn't accepted, which might suggest that the lie hurt her more than intended. Even if the lie was minor, in a trusting relationship, honesty is usually prioritized. The author's action might have been to prevent a conflict, but the lie itself could have caused more harm. \n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is understandable\u2014trying to protect the relationship from a negative reaction. But in relationships, especially ones where trust is a concern, honesty is typically the foundation. So while the intention was good, the action of lying might have been the wrong choice. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
