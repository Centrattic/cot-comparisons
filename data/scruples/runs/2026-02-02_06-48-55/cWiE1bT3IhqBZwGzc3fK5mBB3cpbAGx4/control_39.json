She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author's girlfriend has trust issues from a past cheating experience. They have a setup where she sleeps over five days a week. Recently, she was on a 4-day trip, and he masturbated once. When she's back, she asks when he last masturbated. He initially white-lies, saying it's been a while, then eventually admits after some back-and-forth. He apologizes but she's upset, equating the lie to potential cheating. She left and isn't accepting his apologies. He's conflicted because he thinks she might be overreacting.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the white lie versus her trust issues. The author lied, even if it was a small one. He knew about her past trauma and their agreement to work on communication. By lying, he might have triggered her fears again. She's linking the lie to possible cheating, which makes sense given her history. The fact that she's not accepting his apologies shows that the lie hurt her deeply. \n\nBut wait, the author had reasons. He was trying to avoid an argument based on her previous reaction. However, honesty is usually a cornerstone of trust in relationships. Even if the topic is sensitive, lying can erode that trust further. Maybe he could have been honest but framed the response in a way that's less confrontational. Instead, he chose deception, which might have been worse because it involved her deepest fears.\n\nAlso, their agreement after a recent argument was for her to work on her reactions. But the author's lie might have undermined that progress. He should have considered that honesty is important for mutual trust, even if it's hard. Her reaction is understandable given her past. So, even if the lie was small, the intent might not excuse the action. \n\nIn the end, the author is in the wrong because he lied about something that directly relates to trust, especially knowing her history. His action, though well-intentioned, hurt her trust further. So answer A.\n"
