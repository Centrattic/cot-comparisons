She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for white-lieing about masturbating when asked by his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend has trust issues from being cheated on before. The author mentions that he previously told her the truth, which upset her, so he decided to lie this time to avoid a conflict. He later confesses the lie, but she's upset because she equates lying about this to potentially hiding something more serious like cheating.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author lied, even though he apologized later. The girlfriend's trust issues are a big part of the situation. The author's reasoning was to protect her from his honest answer, which he knows might make her react poorly. However, lying in a relationship, especially about something directly asked, can break trust. The girlfriend's perspective is that if he lied about this, she can't trust him not to lie about other things, like cheating. Even if it's a white lie, the act of lying itself is problematic when honesty is crucial for trust.\n\nThe author might think he's being considerate by not honesty, but in relationships where trust is already an issue, honesty is usually more important. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable given her past. The author's lie, even if well-intentioned, might have been a breach of trust. So, even though the lie was minor, the consequences are significant because of the trust dynamics.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
