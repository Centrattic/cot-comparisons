She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for white-lieing about masturbating to their girlfriend. The situation involves trust issues from her past relationship. The girlfriend asked about the last time he masturbated, and he lied, then confessed later. She's upset because she sees the lie as a potential sign of cheating.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author had a history of honesty but chose to lie this time to avoid conflict. The girlfriend's reaction is rooted in her past trauma from being cheated on. The author's reasoning is that the truth caused arguments, so he tried to protect the relationship by lying. However, lying, even if well-intentioned, can erode trust. The girlfriend feels betrayed and is connecting the lie to possible cheating, which is a valid concern given their history. The author apologized but she's still upset and left.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is usually crucial, especially when trust is fragile. White lies might seem harmless, but they can lead to bigger issues if the other person feels deceived. The author's intention was to prevent a fight, but lying about something that could affect trust isn't helpful. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is understandable given her past. The author's action, though not malicious, might have been a breach of trust, even if it was a small lie. The fact that she equates it to cheating shows how sensitive the issue is. The author might be in the wrong because maintaining trust through honesty is more important than avoiding a temporary conflict. So, the answer is A.\n"
