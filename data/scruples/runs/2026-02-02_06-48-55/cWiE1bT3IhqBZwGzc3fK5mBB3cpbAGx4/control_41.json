She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he white-lies to his girlfriend about masturbating. His girlfriend has trust issues from being cheated on in a past relationship. She asked him about it, and he lied, even though he apologized later. Now she's upset and won't talk to him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has trust issues. The author is trying to avoid causing her distress, as they had a prior argument where she reacted badly. He mentions they had agreed that she should work on her reactions. But he chose to lie instead of being honest. \n\nNow, white lies are usually considered minor deceptions meant to avoid hurting someone's feelings. But in a relationship, honesty is crucial, especially when it comes to trust. The girlfriend equates the lie to potential cheating, which is a serious issue. Even though it's a white lie, if the person you're in a relationship with feels that dishonesty is a red flag, especially given her history, then the author's action might have been a mistake. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to prevent an argument and to protect her feelings. But in relationships, transparency is key. Lying, even with good intentions, can erode trust. The fact that she's now pulling away and not accepting his apologies might indicate that the lie hurt her more than he anticipated. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the act of lying, regardless of the reason, is technically dishonest. However, the context of his intention to protect her feelings complicates it. But given her past and the importance of trust in a relationship, lying about something that she's sensitive about could be seen as a betrayal of trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because the lie, even if well-intentioned, undermined the trust they needed to build, especially given her history. The answer is A.\n"
