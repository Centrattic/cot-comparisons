She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy lying to his girlfriend about masturbating. He white-lied because she had trust issues from a previous relationship. She got upset when he lied, thinking it could mean he's hiding something else, like cheating. He apologized but she's still upset and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy lied, but he had reasons. His girlfriend had trust issues, and he thought she might overreact. He tried to manage the situation to avoid conflict. But the lie led to more problems. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is usually valued. Even if it's a white lie, the girlfriend might feel betrayed. She equated the lie to potential cheating, which is a significant issue. The author's intentions were good, but lying is still lying. The girlfriend's reaction is valid given her past. She might need trust-building, but the lie could have been hurtful.\n\nThe author apologized, but she didn't accept it. That shows the hurt is real. The key points here are the impact of the lie on trust and the girlfriend's past. Even if the lie was to prevent an argument, the action is still dishonest. In the context of a relationship with trust issues, this could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he lied, even if he had good intentions. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is understandable given her history. The answer would likely be A, but maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he lied and it caused significant issues, the answer is A.\n"
