She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for white-lieing about masturbating to their girlfriend. The situation involves trust issues from her past, and there's a history of conflict over honesty.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their girlfriend has trust issues because she was cheated on before. That's important because it shows her past experiences are affecting her current reactions. When she comes back from a trip, the TV show prompts her to ask about his last masturbation. He had already masturbated once during her absence. The last time he told her honestly, she got upset, so this time he white-lies, starting with \"a while\" then \"a few weeks,\" and eventually admits it was the weekend. He apologizes but she's upset, equating the lie to possible cheating. Now she's not staying over.\n\nThe key points here are: trust issues, the intention behind the lie, and the context of their previous arguments. The author thought the white lie was to protect the relationship from her overreaction. But in relationships where trust is fragile, any deception\u2014even a white lie\u2014can be seen as a breach. The girlfriend feels that if he can lie about this, he might be hiding something bigger, like cheating. She's not just upset about the lie itself but the implication that he might not be truthful about other things. The author tried to explain his intent, but she's ignoring the apologies. \n\nIn relationships, especially with someone with trust issues, honesty is crucial. While the author's intention was to prevent conflict, lying\u2014even with good intentions\u2014can erode trust. The girlfriend's reaction is rooted in her past trauma and current insecurities. Even if the lie seems minor, it can trigger a lot in someone who's already vulnerable. The author might not see the lie as a big deal, but for her, it's a red flag. So, while the author's motive was to protect the relationship, the action of lying is still wrong because it undermines trust. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
