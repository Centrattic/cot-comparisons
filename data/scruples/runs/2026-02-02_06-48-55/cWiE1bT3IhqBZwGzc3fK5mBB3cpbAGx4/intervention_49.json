She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for white-lieing about masturbating to their girlfriend. The scenario involves trust issues from her past, and previous arguments about honesty.\n\nFirst, the author white-lied to avoid a conflict after a previous negative reaction. But the girlfriend took it as a betrayal, linking it to cheating. Even though the lie was about something minor (masturbation), in a relationship where trust is fragile, any deception can feel significant. The author did apologize and explain, but the girlfriend isn't accepting it. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial, especially when there are existing trust issues. Even a small lie can erode trust further. The author's intention was to protect the relationship from conflict, but the act of lying might have done more harm. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is rooted in her past trauma. The author's choice to lie, despite good intentions, may have been the wrong move because it undermined the trust needed to heal her past experiences.\n\nSo, even though the lie was small, the context makes it a problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
