She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for lying about masturbating. So, first, the situation: the author's girlfriend has trust issues from being cheated on before. They agreed that she should work on her reactions to honest answers. When she asks about his last masturbation, he lies, then gets caught. She's upset, equates it to hiding something worse, and left. He apologized but she won't take it.\n\nSo, the main points to consider. The author white-lies, thinking of past arguments and her reactions. But the girlfriend sees any lie as a potential sign of cheating or hiding something. Trust is a big factor here because of her history. Even though the lie is small, in a relationship where trust is fragile, lies can be damaging. The author's intention was to avoid conflict, but the act of lying, regardless of intent, might have broken the trust. The girlfriend's reaction is based on her past trauma, making her hyper-vigilant. The author might not see the seriousness, but in a trusting relationship, honesty is key. Even if the lie is minor, if one partner equates any lie to a bigger issue, that's a problem. The author's apology wasn't accepted, showing the issue isn't just about the lie but the trust and how to handle honesty in the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was good, trying to protect her from a reaction. But maybe in a healthy relationship, honesty is preferred even if it causes temporary discomfort. The author might be in the wrong for lying, even if it's a white lie, because it's a breach of trust. The key is that in relationships, especially with trust issues, honesty is crucial. So the answer might be A, yes, he's in the wrong. But maybe there's nuance. However, given the girlfriend's valid reasons due to her past, the lie, even if small, could be seen as a transgression. So, I think A is correct.\n"
