She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying about masturbating to their girlfriend. The situation involves trust issues from the girlfriend's past relationship.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author white-lies when asked about masturbation. The girlfriend has trust issues from being cheated on before. They had an agreement that she should work on her reactions to honest answers. The author lies to avoid a conflict but gets called out, leading to a breakup situation.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were protecting the girlfriend from a bad reaction, based on her previous shutdown. But the girlfriend sees the lie as a lack of transparency and trusts being broken, linking it to cheating. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is usually crucial. Even white lies can be seen as deceitful, especially if one partner has trust issues. The author's intention was to prevent conflict, but lying might have undermined trust. The girlfriend's reaction is rooted in her past trauma, so her sensitivity is valid. \n\nThe author did apologize but the girlfriend didn't accept it. The issue here is whether the lie was justified. While the intention was good, actions have consequences. In a relationship where trust is already fragile, lying\u2014no matter how small\u2014can be damaging. The author might have considered other ways to handle the situation without lying, like setting boundaries or discussing the topic in a different way. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because honesty is foundational in relationships, especially when there are trust issues. The lie, even if well-intentioned, breached that trust.\n"
