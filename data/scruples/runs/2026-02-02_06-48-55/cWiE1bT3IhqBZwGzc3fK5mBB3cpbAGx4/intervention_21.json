She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for white-lieing to his girlfriend about masturbating. \n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend has trust issues from her ex cheating. They agreed during a makeup that she should work on her reactions to certain truths. The author lied about the timing of his masturbation, knowing her past reaction. He white-lieed to avoid conflict but ended up causing more issues because she equated the lie to potential cheating.\n\nSo, the main points. Did the author do wrong? Well, he chose to lie, even though he apologized later. The girlfriend felt betrayed because she associates any lie with possible cheating. The author's intention was to prevent a bad reaction, but the lie still happened. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is key. Even if it's a white lie, lying about something that the partner is sensitive about can be damaging. The fact that he lied despite knowing her trust issues makes it more problematic. The girlfriend's reaction is based on her trauma and the agreement they had. The author might have thought he was protecting the situation, but in the end, the lie hurt the trust more. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be yes, he's in the wrong. Even though the intent was good, the action of lying is still wrong, especially in a situation where trust is crucial.\n"
