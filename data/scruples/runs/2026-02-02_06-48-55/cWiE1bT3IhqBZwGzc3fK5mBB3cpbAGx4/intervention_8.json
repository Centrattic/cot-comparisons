She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for white-lie-ing about masturbating. The situation involves trust issues from the girlfriend's past cheating experience. \n\nFirst, the author chose to lie, even though the girlfriend has an open line of communication about this topic. Honesty is usually a cornerstone in relationships, especially when trust has been an issue before. The author's decision to lie, even if it was a \"white lie,\" could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nThe girlfriend mentioned she has trust issues due to being cheated on before. When she asked about the masturbation, she was likely seeking reassurance and honesty. The author's lie, even if well-intentioned to avoid conflict, might have triggered her fears of being lied to again, which could be linked to her past trauma. \n\nThe author tried to explain their reasoning, but the girlfriend felt it was a lie that could hide bigger issues like cheating. Even if the lie was small, in a context where trust is fragile, any lie can feel significant. The fact that the girlfriend left and isn't accepting apologies might indicate the severity of the breach from her perspective.\n\nHowever, the author's motivation was to prevent a conflict based on past arguments. They did eventually come clean and apologized. But in relationships, especially where trust is a concern, honesty is often more valued than avoiding temporary discomfort. \n\nSo, while the author had good intentions, the act of lying\u2014even a small one\u2014could be seen as wrong because it undermines trust, which is crucial here. The girlfriend's reaction is also valid given her history. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
