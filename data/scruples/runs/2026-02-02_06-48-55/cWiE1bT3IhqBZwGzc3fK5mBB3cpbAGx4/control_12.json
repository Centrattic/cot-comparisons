She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is in a 7-month relationship with their girlfriend, who has trust issues from being cheated on in her previous relationship. She stays over five days a week. The girlfriend went on a four-day trip with her best friend, and during that time, the author masturbated once. When she returns, they're watching TV, and a guy on TV is watching porn, prompting her to ask when the author last masturbated.\n\nPreviously, when she asked the same question, the author was honest, and she got upset. They had a small argument, and agreed that she should work on her reactions. This time, the author white lies, first saying \"a while,\" then \"a few weeks,\" then finally admitting it was over the weekend. The author apologizes for lying, explaining they were worried about her reaction. The girlfriend is upset, equates the lie to possible cheating, and doesn't take the apologies. She left and won't stay over.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the concept of white lies. A white lie is generally a small lie told to avoid hurting someone's feelings. However, in relationships, honesty is often crucial, especially when trust is an issue. The author's girlfriend has significant trust issues from a past relationship where she was cheated on. That's a key point here.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they lied to avoid another argument or an upset reaction. They were concerned about the girlfriend's previous reaction. However, lying, even as a white lie, can erode trust. The girlfriend felt that the lie could mean he was hiding something else, like cheating. Even though the author's intent was to protect her feelings, the act of lying is problematic in a relationship where trust is already fragile.\n\nAnother angle: the couple agreed that she would work on her reactions to hurtful truths. The author chose not to be truthful, which might undermine the agreement they made to work on communication. If they agreed that honesty was important, then lying, even with good intentions, could be a breach of that agreement. The girlfriend's reaction is justified because trust issues can make any lie seem like a red flag, even if it's a small one.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author's intention was to prevent conflict and that the lie was minor. But in relationships where trust is a concern, any dishonesty can be seen as a bigger issue. The girlfriend's perspective is that if he can lie about this, he can lie about anything, which is a valid concern in someone with a history of betrayal.\n\nThe author did apologize and explain their reasoning, but the girlfriend didn't accept it. Her reaction might be part of her healing process from past trauma. The author's action, while well-intentioned, might not have considered the deeper trust issues. So, the author's mistake was lying even though honesty was a priority in their agreement. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they prioritized avoiding a conflict over maintaining trust and transparency, which is essential in a relationship with existing trust issues.\n"
