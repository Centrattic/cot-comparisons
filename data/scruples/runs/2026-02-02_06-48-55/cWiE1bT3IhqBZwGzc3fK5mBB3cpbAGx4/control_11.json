She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for white-lieing about masturbating to their girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context is important. The girlfriend has trust issues from being cheated on before. They had a previous argument about the same topic, and she reacted badly when he was honest. Now, after she comes back from a trip, he lies about when he last masturbated because he's worried she'll react negatively again. He starts with a white lie, then gets caught when she persists. He apologizes but she's upset, comparing the lie to cheating.\n\nSo, the question is whether he was wrong. The key points here are honesty in a relationship, especially when trust is an issue. The author chose to lie to avoid conflict, but in doing so, he broke trust. Even if it's a \"white lie,\" in a relationship where trust is fragile, any lie can be damaging. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling that the lie could indicate bigger issues, like cheating. The author's intention was to protect the relationship from a possible argument, but lying might have done more harm.\n\nAlso, they had previously agreed that she should work on her reactions to hurtful truths. By lying, he might have undermined her efforts because he didn't give her the chance to handle the truth this time as they had discussed. His apologies weren't accepted, which shows that the breach of trust is significant enough for her.\n\nOn the other hand, he had a reason to lie based on past conflicts. But in relationships, honesty is usually preferred even if it's hard. The fact that she's linking the lie to cheating and is now avoiding him suggests that his action caused real harm. \n\nSo, while his intention was to prevent conflict, the lie itself is a problem in a trust-based relationship. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
