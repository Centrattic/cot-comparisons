She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves white-lie about masturbation due to the girlfriend's trust issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author white-lies to avoid an argument, knowing the girlfriend has trust issues from a past relationship. They had a previous argument about honesty, and the girlfriend tends to shut down when confronted with truths she finds hurtful. The author's intention was to protect the relationship from conflict, but the girlfriend feels betrayal because of the lie.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is usually valued, but context matters. The author's lie wasn't about something like cheating but a personal habit. However, the girlfriend equates the lie to potential bigger secrets. The key here is whether the lie was justified given the circumstances. The author apologized, but the girlfriend isn't accepting it. \n\nSome might say the author is wrong because lying, even a white lie, can erode trust. Others might argue that the intention was good to avoid conflict, especially given the girlfriend's history. But trust is foundational, and lying\u2014even if well-intentioned\u2014can be damaging. The fact that the girlfriend is now more upset and not accepting apologies suggests that the lie hurt her more than the author anticipated. \n\nSo, even if the lie was to prevent an argument, the act of lying can create bigger issues. The author might be in the wrong because trust is crucial, and the girlfriend's reaction is valid given her past. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
