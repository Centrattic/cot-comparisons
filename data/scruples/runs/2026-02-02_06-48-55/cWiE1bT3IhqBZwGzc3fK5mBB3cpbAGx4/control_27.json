She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying about masturbating to his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: the author and his girlfriend have been in a relationship for seven months. She has trust issues from a previous cheating experience. He sleeps over at her place five days a week. She came back from a four-day trip with her best friend. During that time, he masturbated once. When his girlfriend asks about it, he white-lies, first saying it's been a while, then a few weeks, and finally admits it was this weekend. He apologizes but she's upset, thinks it's a sign of bigger lies, and leaves. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are the white lie and the trust issues. The author says he lied because he was afraid of her reaction, based on a previous argument where she got upset. He thought she needed to work on how she reacts to truths. But she's taking the lie as a betrayal, linking it to cheating. \n\nNow, I need to consider whether lying is wrong in this context. In relationships, honesty is usually valued. Even if it's a white lie, lying can erode trust. The girlfriend has trust issues already, so any lie, even a small one, might trigger her past trauma. The author's intention was to avoid conflict, but lying can create bigger issues. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction might be seen as overreacting, especially since the act of masturbating isn't harmful. But her perspective is valid given her history. The author tried to explain his reasoning and apologized, but she's choosing not to accept it. \n\nThe problem is that lies, even white ones, can be perceived as deceitful. The author might have thought he was protecting the relationship by avoiding a conflict, but in doing so, he compromised trust. Trust is crucial, especially when one partner has had past issues with cheating. The girlfriend's fear that he could be hiding something else is understandable from her perspective. \n\nSo, while the author had good intentions, lying to her, even if well-meaning, was a breach of trust. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because honesty is fundamental in relationships, and white lies can still be harmful, especially when trust is already fragile.\n"
