She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for white-lie-ing about masturbating. The story involves a girlfriend with trust issues from a previous relationship where she was cheated on. The author lied because the last time he was honest, she got upset, and they had agreed that she needed to work on her reactions.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author lied, but the lie was a \"white lie\" to avoid conflict. The girlfriend is upset because she equates lying about this with possible cheating or hiding something bigger. The author apologized but she's still mad.\n\nHmm. On one hand, honesty is important in relationships. If trust is a big issue, then even a small lie about masturbation could feel like a breach of trust. The girlfriend's past experience with cheating might be making her hyper-sensitive to any lies. She might fear that if he can lie about this, he could lie about other things, including cheating. So even a white lie might not be acceptable in that context.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to avoid hurting her feelings again. They had a previous argument where she shut down after the truth. The author was trying to protect the relationship from another conflict by lying. But then, lying can erode trust, especially in someone who already has trust issues. The author might have thought they were helping, but in reality, the lie might have caused more harm.\n\nI need to consider the balance between honesty and protecting feelings. In relationships where trust is fragile, maybe honesty is even more crucial. The fact that the girlfriend equates this lie with hiding something more serious (like cheating) is a red flag. The author should have found a way to be honest but maybe framed it in a way that's less triggering. For example, explaining the truth without making her feel insecure or blamed.\n\nBut the issue is that the author chose to lie instead of finding a middle ground. Even if the intention was good, the act of lying is still a problem. The girlfriend's reaction is valid given her history. So the author is in the wrong because they lied, even if it was a white lie. They should have been honest but perhaps softened the delivery or discussed it in a way that's less confrontational. The fact that the lie led to the girlfriend leaving shows how much this issue matters to her. The author's choice to lie, despite knowing her trust issues, might not be helping the relationship heal. \n\nSo the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
