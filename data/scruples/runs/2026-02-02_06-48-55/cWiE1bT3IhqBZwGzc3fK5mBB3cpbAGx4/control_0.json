She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's girlfriend has trust issues from being cheated on before. She came back from a 4-day trip, and when she asked about his last masturbation, he white-laid. The last time he was honest, she got upset. They had agreed that she'd work on her reactions. This time, he lied, then confessed after some back and forth. She's upset, equating the lie to potential cheating, and left after ignoring his apologies.\n\nThe key factors here are trust and honesty in the relationship. The author's reasoning is that he lied to avoid her negative reaction, but the girlfriend sees it as a violation of trust. Even though it's a white lie, in a relationship with existing trust issues, any lie can be perceived as a bigger problem. The fact that she equates it to cheating shows how deep her trust issues are. The author might think it's minor, but in their relationship context, honesty is crucial. Also, he didn't stick to the agreement they made about her handling reactions. While his intentions were good, the action of lying, regardless of intent, can damage trust. The girlfriend's reaction, though intense, might stem from past trauma. But the author's choice to lie, even if well-meaning, could be seen as the wrong move here. So, considering all that, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because honesty is typically valued in relationships, especially when trust is a concern. Even if the lie was small, it's the principle that matters.\n"
