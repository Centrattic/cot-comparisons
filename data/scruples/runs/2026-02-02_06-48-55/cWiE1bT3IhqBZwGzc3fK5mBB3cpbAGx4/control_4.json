She acknowledges that she has current trust issues. My GF sleeps over my place 5 days out of the week. \n\nMy GF came back today from a 4 day international vacation trip with her girl best friend. During this period, I masturbated once back here at home. My girlfriend is now back and we're on the couch watching TV. Guy in TV starts watching porn, which prompts my girlfriend to ask me when the last time I masturbated was.\n\nThe last time she asked me about masturbating, I gave her an honest answer, and she got very upset. I don't see much of a problem with masturbating. We've had a lot of small arguments recently, so part of what we agreed on when we made up is that she'd work on the way she reacts to hurtful truths, as she normally shuts down and stops communicating. \n\nAs my girlfriend asks me when the last time I masturbated was, I white-lied and told her it's been a while. As she persists with her questioning, I say that it's been a few weeks. A bit more questioning and I reveal it's actually only been this weekend. I then sincerely apologize profusely about lying, explaining that I was wary of how she'd react, based on her previous reactions. \n\nGF hates the fact that I lied, and equates it to \"if you lie about this, you can be hiding anything\". She associates white lies to lies with cheating. I try to explain my intentions and my line of thinking, but she's had none of it. She's since left and won't be spending the night. \n\nI understand I'm an asshole for white lying, but in my head she might be over reacting a bit. She's also ignored my apologies. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for white lying about masturbating. The situation involves trust issues from the girlfriend's past. The author lied once before, which upset her, and they agreed she needs to work on her reactions. This time, he white-lies again, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, white lies are generally considered morally okay because they're meant to avoid hurting feelings. But in a relationship where trust is crucial, lying\u2014even a white lie\u2014can be problematic. The girlfriend's reaction is based on past trauma from cheating, so she might see any lie as a potential cover-up for bigger issues like cheating. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's protecting her feelings, but honesty is foundational in relationships. By lying, he might have breached that trust. Even if his intent was good, the act of lying could undermine the trust she's trying to rebuild. The girlfriend's perspective is valid given her history, and she's right to feel hurt if she associates the lie with dishonesty about cheating. \n\nAlso, the author acknowledges he's an asshole for lying, which suggests he knows it's wrong. The fact that he had to apologize and that she ignored it shows the damage the lie caused. So, even though the lie was minor, the context of past issues makes it the author's fault.\n"
