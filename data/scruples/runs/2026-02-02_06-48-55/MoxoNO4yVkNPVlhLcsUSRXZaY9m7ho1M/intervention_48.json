My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with their brother for destroying a Confederate flag their sister inherited. The situation is a bit complex. The brother destroyed the flag, which the sister got from her friend's grandmother, and it's a personal memento for her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The sister didn't display the flag publicly; it was in her bedroom, which she no longer uses. The family is from the North and doesn't support the Confederacy. The brother destroyed the flag without consulting her, which was a personal item of emotional value.\n\nThe author is upset because the brother acted without respecting their sister's wishes. The brother doesn't think he did anything wrong. The author didn't confront the sister about it but hid the flag instead. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The brother's action was disrespectful to the sister's sentimental value. However, the author didn't confront the sister directly, which might have been the better course of action. But the brother's act of destroying the flag without permission is the main issue here. The author being upset is understandable because it was a personal item. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's anger stems from the brother's action, not the author's own actions. The author didn't do anything wrong; they were upset and tried to protect the flag. The brother's action is the problem here. The author's response was to hide the flag and confront the brother, which seems reasonable. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong because the brother violated the sister's property and emotions.\n"
