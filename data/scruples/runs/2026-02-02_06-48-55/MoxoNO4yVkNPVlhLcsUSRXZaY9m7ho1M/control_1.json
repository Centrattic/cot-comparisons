My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that the sister inherited. \n\nFirst, the context: the brother destroyed a Confederate flag that the sister had as a personal memento. The sister doesn't support the Confederacy and the flag is a cherished item from her late friends' family. The author is upset with the brother for tearing it up without considering the sentimental value.\n\nSo, the key points here are the brother's actions and the author's response. The brother destroyed the flag, which was a personal item to the sister. Even though the flag is associated with a racist history, the sister sees it as a memorial to her loved ones. The brother's action was disrespectful, and the author is right to be upset. The author didn't confront the sister directly but hid the flag instead, which might be a protective action. \n\nThe question is about the author being in the wrong. The author isn't the one who destroyed the flag; they're the one who's upset about it. Their anger stems from the brother's disrespect towards the sister's feelings. Unless the author did something wrong themselves, like defending the brother or not taking action, but in this case, they confronted the brother and tried to salvage the flag. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The brother is the one at fault here for destroying a personal item without consent. The author's anger is justified given the situation.\n"
