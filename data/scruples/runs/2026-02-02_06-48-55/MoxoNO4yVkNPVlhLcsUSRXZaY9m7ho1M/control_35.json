My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the person is asking if they're at fault for being angry at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister inherited an old Confederate flag from her friends' family. It's a personal memento with emotional value, from her best friend's grandparents. The sister doesn't display it publicly, keeps it in her bedroom, which she no longer uses. The family is in the northern US and doesn't support the Confederacy. The brother, who's known to be grumpy but sometimes nice, tore the flag up during a Christmas visit. The author found it in the trash, tried to save it, didn't tell their sister, and told the brother he's an ass.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The brother destroyed something that was a meaningful keepsake. Even if the flag is a symbol of a controversial history, the sister's intent isn't to support that\u2014it's just a personal memory. The brother acted without considering her feelings. The author is upset because their sibling's sentimental item was destroyed. \n\nBut does the author have a responsibility here? They didn't destroy the flag, just felt upset and took action to save it. They didn't inform their sister, which might be a different issue, but the main question is about being in the wrong regarding their anger at the brother. \n\nThe brother's actions seem to be the problem here. Disrespecting someone's personal memento, regardless of the item's historical context, could be seen as wrong. The author is justified in being upset because the brother damaged something that had sentimental value. \n\nHowever, could there be a different angle? Maybe the brother thought he was doing something right by removing a symbol he associate with racism. But even so, destroying it without discussion isn't the right approach. The author's anger is a reaction to the brother's actions, not the other way around. So the author isn't in the wrong; the brother is. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
