My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at their brother for destroying their sister's Confederate flag.\n\nFirst, context: the sister inherited an old Confederate flag that was a meaningful memento from her close friends' family. The family lives in the North and doesn't support the Confederacy. The flag was in her bedroom, not displayed publicly. The brother destroyed it, thinking it was racist. The author is upset about this.\n\nSo, the key points here. The flag is a personal item with sentimental value, even if it's a controversial symbol. The brother acted on his own without discussing it, which might be a problem. The author is upset because the flag was important to their sister and the brother didn't consider that. \n\nBut the brother's reasoning is that the Confederacy is associated with racism. However, the flag's context here is different\u2014it's a historical item, a family memento. The sister doesn't display it publicly, so maybe the brother overstepped by destroying it without understanding its personal significance.\n\nThe author didn't confront the sister but tried to save the flag. They're angry at the brother for his actions. The question is if the author is wrong for being angry.\n\nPossible angles: Is destroying someone else's property without consent ever acceptable? The brother's actions were disrespectful and caused harm. The author is defending their sister's emotional connection, which is valid. The author isn't the one who destroyed it, they're reacting to it. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry. The brother is the one who did the destructive act. The author's response (not telling the sister, but hiding the flag) might be a different issue, but the anger itself is justified given the sister's loss. So answer B.\n"
