My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying their sister's Confederate flag. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, context: The brother, D, destroyed a Confederate flag that their sister H had inherited. The flag was a personal memento from her best friend's grandmother and grandfather, who were important to her. The family is in the northern USA and doesn't support the Confederacy. The sister didn't display the flag publicly; it was in her bedroom, which she no longer uses. The brother and his girlfriend were staying in her old room during a family visit.\n\nThe author found the flag torn up in the trash, collected it, and hid it without telling H. They confronted the brother, who didn't think he was wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants opinions.\n\nSo, who's right here? Let's consider the key points. The sister had sentimental value attached to the flag, even if it's a controversial item. The brother destroyed it without her permission. The author is upset about this and took action to preserve the flag. The question is whether the author is wrong for being mad.\n\nPossible angles: The brother's actions were disrespectful to the sister's property and feelings. The author tried to mediate by hiding the flag and confronting the brother. But maybe the author should have informed the sister about what happened, instead of hiding it. However, the author might have done that to protect the sister's feelings or avoid conflict, given the brother's difficult personality.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the flag was a personal item, and the brother destroyed it without consent, the brother did wrong. The author's reaction seems justified in being upset. However, the author's choice to hide the flag instead of telling the sister might be a point of contention. But the user is asking if the author is wrong for being angry, not about the actions taken afterward.\n\nSo, the main issue is the brother's actions. The author's anger is a response to that. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I think the brother's actions are worse. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
