My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being angry at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited. \n\nFirst, the context: the family is in the northern US and doesn't support the Confederacy. The sister got the flag as a personal memento from her friends' grandmother. It's a historical item tied to her memories of loved ones. She doesn't display it publicly; it's in her bedroom, which she no longer uses.\n\nThe brother destroyed it, thinking it was racist, but the sister sees it as a personal artifact. The author is upset because the sister was upset, and they covered up what happened. The author is angry at the brother for destroying something sentimental without discussing it first.\n\nNow, considering if the author is wrong. The key points are intent and respect. The brother acted unilaterally without considering the sentimental value. The author's anger is justified because the sister valued the item, even if they disagree with keeping it. However, the author's actions (hiding the flag and not telling the sister) might be seen as their own issue. But the main question is about the author's anger towards the brother. \n\nThe brother's action was disrespectful, regardless of his intent. The author isn't in the wrong for being mad at him for destroying something precious without consent. The answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The brother made the mistake, and the author's reaction is valid given the sister's feelings.\n"
