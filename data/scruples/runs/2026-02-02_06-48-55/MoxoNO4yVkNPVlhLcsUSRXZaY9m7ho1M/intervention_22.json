My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with their brother for destroying a Confederate flag their sister inherited. Let me start by understanding each person's position.\n\nThe sister, H, has a Confederate flag that's a personal memento from her late best friend's grandmother and her grandfather. It's not displayed publicly, just in her bedroom, which she no longer uses. The family is from the northern USA and doesn't support the Confederacy. The brother, D, destroyed the flag, probably to make a point about racism. The author is upset because they think destroying a personal item is wrong, even if it's a controversial symbol. They hid the torn flag to protect their sister's feelings.\n\nNow, the key points here are ownership and respect for personal property. The sister inherited the flag, so it's her property. Even if the flag is a symbol of a controversial history, destroying someone else's property without consent is generally considered wrong. The brother's actions were a violation of that. The author's reaction is about protecting their sister's sentimental item, which is important to her. The author didn't confront their sister, which might be seen as not fully addressing the issue, but the main issue is the brother's actions.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is defending their sister's property and emotions, which is understandable. The brother's act of destruction without consent is the problem here. The author's anger is about the violation of personal property and the disregard for their sister's feelings. So the author isn't wrong in being upset. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
