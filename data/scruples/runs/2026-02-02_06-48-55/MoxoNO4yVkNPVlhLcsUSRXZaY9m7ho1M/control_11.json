My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited.\n\nFirst, the context: The brother destroyed the flag, which was a personal memento from their sister's late friends' family. The sister doesn't support the Confederacy and wouldn't display it publicly. The author found the flag torn up in the trash and hid it, not telling their sister. They're upset with their brother for doing this.\n\nSo, the main points here. The Confederate flag is a sensitive symbol, especially associated with the Confederacy and slavery. But in this case, the sister inherited it as a personal remembrance, not as a symbol of support. The brother's action of destroying it could be seen as violating her personal property and emotional attachment. The author is upset because their brother took it without consent, destroyed something meaningful to her, and didn't see it as wrong.\n\nThe author isn't the one who destroyed the flag. They tried to help by saving what was left and not telling their sister. The question is if the author is wrong for being angry at their brother. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn many cases, taking someone else's property without permission is generally wrong, regardless of the item's nature. Even if the brother had his own reasons, he didn't have the right to destroy it. The author's reaction seems justified because he protected the sister's feelings and preserved the item. The author isn't wrong for being upset; the brother's action was the issue. So the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
