My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a Confederate flag that a sister inherited, which was destroyed by the brother. The author is upset about this and is asking if they're the asshole for being mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The flag is described as a personal memento, not displayed publicly. It was from her best friends' grandmother and grandfather, so it's sentimental. The siblings are from the northern USA and don't support the Confederacy. The brother destroyed the flag without the sister's consent, thinking it was racist. The author found the destroyed flag, hid it, and confronted the brother, who doesn't think he did anything wrong.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for being angry. The brother's action was destroying something that belonged to the sister without her permission. Even if the brother had his reasons (thinking it's racist), he shouldn't have taken it without asking. The author is upset because the sister had a sentimental attachment, and the brother acted recklessly. The author hid the flag instead of telling the sister, maybe to avoid conflict or protect the sister's feelings. \n\nIs the author wrong for being mad? The brother did something that could be seen as overstepping, especially without discussing it with the sister. The author's anger is about the brother's unauthorized destruction of a personal item. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out the brother did this. The author is trying to protect the sister's feelings by not telling her, which could be seen as a good intention. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have told the sister what happened. But the author's main issue is with the brother's actions, not necessarily hiding the truth. The key point is the brother's lack of consent and the destruction of a personal item. The author's anger seems justified in that context. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The brother's actions were the problem, not the author being upset.\n"
