My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying their sister's Confederate flag. The author's sister inherited the flag, which has historical significance to her family, even though the family doesn't support the Confederacy. The brother destroyed the flag, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister received the flag from her friend's grandmother and grandfather, making it a personal memento. She doesn't display it publicly; it's in her bedroom. The brother, who is described as hard to get along with, tore the flag and the author is upset and hid it without telling the sister.\n\nThe key points here are the intent of the brother's action, the value of the item, and the author's response. The brother might have destroyed the flag for political reasons, not considering its sentimental value. However, destroying someone else's property without permission is generally wrong, regardless of the reason. The author is upset because the item was important to their sister, so their anger is justified.\n\nThe author didn't confront the sister yet but is upset with the brother. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the brother acted without consent and the flag was a meaningful item, the author's reaction isn't unreasonable. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
