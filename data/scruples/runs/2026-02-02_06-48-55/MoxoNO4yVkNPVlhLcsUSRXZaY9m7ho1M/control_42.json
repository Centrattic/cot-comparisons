My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a Confederate flag that the sister inherited, and the brother destroyed it without her consent.\n\nFirst, the brother destroyed something that was personal to the sister. The flag is a family heirloom, even though it's a Confederate flag. The sister didn't display it publicly, just kept it in her bedroom as a memento from her friends' grandparents. The family is in the North and doesn't support the Confederacy, so it's more of a sentimental item.\n\nThe author found out the brother tore the flag up, collected the pieces, hid them, and didn't tell the sister. The author is upset with the brother but hasn't approached the sister yet. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by being mad at the brother.\n\nThe brother's actions seem disrespectful. Even if the author doesn't support the Confederacy, the sister has a right to her sentimental belongings. Destroying someone's personal property without their consent is a violation, regardless of the item's nature. The author is not the one who destroyed it, so their anger towards the brother makes sense. The author is protecting the sister's feelings by not telling her, which might be well-intentioned but could also be avoiding conflict.\n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong for being angry at the brother for his actions. The brother took it upon himself to destroy something that wasn't his to decide. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
