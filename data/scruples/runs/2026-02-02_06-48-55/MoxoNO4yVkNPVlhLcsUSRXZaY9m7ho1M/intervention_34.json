My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being angry at their brother for destroying the Confederate flag that the sister inherited. First, I need to understand the context thoroughly.\n\nThe key points are: the sister H has a Confederate flag that's a personal memento, given to her by her best friend's grandmother and grandfather. It's a family heirloom, not displayed publicly. The brother D destroyed it, thinking it was racist. The author is upset about this and hid the flag instead of confronting the sister. The user initially thinks the author is wrong but wants to know if that's accurate.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The author's perspective is that the flag is a personal item with sentimental value. The brother's action was destroying it without consent, which is a problem. The author's response was to hide the flag and not tell the sister, which might be seen as protecting the sister but also not addressing the issue directly.\n\nLegally, the sister owns the flag as an heirloom. Destroying someone else's property without permission is a violation, regardless of the motive. So D is clearly in the wrong. The author's anger is justified because the brother's action was disrespectful and destructive of the sister's property.\n\nThe author's decision to hide the flag instead of confronting the sister might be a point of contention. Maybe they wanted to protect the sister from the upset of finding out the flag was destroyed. However, the author isn't the one who destroyed it. Their reaction is to their brother's actions. So the author isn't in the wrong for being mad at the brother for doing something illegal and disrespectful. The author's choice to hide the evidence could be criticized for not being honest with the sister, but the core issue is the brother's action. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry at the brother.\n"
