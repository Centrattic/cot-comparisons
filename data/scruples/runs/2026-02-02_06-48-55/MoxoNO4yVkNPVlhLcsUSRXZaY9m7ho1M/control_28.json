My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: the brother (D) destroyed the flag, thinking it was racist, even though the sister (H) didn't display it publicly and considered it a meaningful heirloom. The family is in the North and doesn't support the Confederacy. The author is upset about this and took the flag from the trash, hiding it so the sister doesn't know it was destroyed. The brother doesn't think he did anything wrong.\n\nThe author's stance is that the flag is a personal memento, not a public display of racism. The brother acted without considering its sentimental value. The author didn't confront the sister yet, which might be part of the dilemma.\n\nNow, the key points: Was the brother right to destroy someone else's property without permission? Even if the flag is controversial, destroying it is a big step. The author is protecting the sister's feelings, which shows they value her emotional well-being. The brother's action was disrespectful and possibly illegal, as he destroyed something that belonged to another family member. The author's reaction is anger, which is a natural response to someone damaging a cherished item. The author also tried to mitigate the damage by saving the flag, which suggests they care about the sister's feelings.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're mad at their brother for doing something wrong, so their anger is justified. The author isn't the one who destroyed the flag; they're the one who tried to cover it up to protect their sister. So the answer should be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong. The brother made the mistake, and the author is reacting appropriately.\n"
