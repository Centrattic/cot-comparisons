My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag. The situation involves family members and the flag's significance.\n\nFirst, the sister H inherited the flag from her best friend's grandmother. It's a personal memento, not displayed publicly. The brother D destroyed it, thinking it's racist. The author is upset about this, as the flag was important to the sister. \n\nThe author's argument is that the flag was a personal item, not meant to support the Confederacy. The brother's action was destroying someone else's property without consent. The author didn't confront the sister, just hid the flag. They argue that D is wrong for destroying it without discussing it first.\n\nOn the other hand, D might think he was standing up against something he considers racist. But the flag's significance here is as a keepsake, not a public symbol. Destroying someone's belongings without their permission is generally wrong, regardless of the motive. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about their brother's actions towards their sister. The brother overstepped by destroying the item without communication. So the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
