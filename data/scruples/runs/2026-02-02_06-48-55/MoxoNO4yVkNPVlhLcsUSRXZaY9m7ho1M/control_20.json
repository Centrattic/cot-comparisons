My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a brother destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited. The author is upset with their brother for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister H got the flag from her best friend's grandmother, who had her grandfather's flag. The flag is a personal memento, not displayed publicly. The family is in the northern US and doesn't support the Confederacy. The brother D sees the flag as a racist symbol and decided to destroy it without asking. The author found it in the trash, saved it, and didn't tell the sister. Now, the question is whether the author is wrong for being mad at the brother.\n\nSo, the key points here: The brother took a private family item and destroyed it, possibly without the owner's consent. The author is upset because they think the flag is a personal momento, not a public statement. The brother's actions were done in a private setting, but destroying someone's sentimental property without permission is generally considered wrong. The author is protecting the sister by not telling her about the destruction. \n\nIs the author wrong for being angry? Well, the brother acted without consent, which is a problem. The author's anger is a natural reaction to the brother's disrespect towards the sister's feelings and property. The author didn't destroy the flag themselves; they just collected the pieces. The sister might be upset if she knew, but the author is trying to avoid conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother might have had good intentions, thinking he's removing a symbol of hate. But even if the intentions are good, destroying someone else's property without asking is a breach of trust. The author's anger is justified because the brother violated the sister's privacy and got rid of something meaningful to her. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The answer is probably B (No).\n"
