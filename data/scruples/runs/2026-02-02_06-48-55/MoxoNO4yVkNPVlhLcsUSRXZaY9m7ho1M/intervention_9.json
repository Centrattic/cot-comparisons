My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister, H, has a Confederate flag that she got from her friend's grandmother. It's a personal memento, passed down through her friend's family. The flag is in her bedroom, not displayed publicly. The author and their family don't support the Confederacy and live in the northern US. The brother, D, destroyed the flag, probably thinking it was racist. The author is upset because it was a sentimental item for their sister, and the brother didn't respect that.\n\nThe author is conflicted here. On one hand, the brother might have had intentions to remove something he saw as racist, but he did it without consent. On the other, the author is upset because the sister's personal item was destroyed. The key points here are consent, intent, and the value of the item to the sister. \n\nThe author didn't confront their sister about it, which might make it hard to assess the sister's feelings. Maybe the sister didn't mind the flag being there since it's not public. But the brother acted unilaterally, which is a problem. The author collected the flag and hid it, but didn't inform the sister. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's anger seems justified because destroying someone else's personal property without permission is wrong. However, the brother's intent might be seen as trying to do the right thing by removing a symbol of racism. But intent doesn't absolve the action. \n\nThe author's actions (hiding the flag and not telling the sister) might be complicating things. But the main issue is the brother's actions. The sister's feelings about the flag are important. If the sister didn't want it destroyed, then the brother's actions were wrong. The author's anger towards the brother for that is understandable. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the brother trespassed on personal property without consent. The author's responsibility is to protect the sister's belongings and feelings. The brother's actions were inappropriate regardless of his intent. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
