My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person (AITA) is wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag their sister inherited.\n\nFirst, context is key. The Confederate flag is a sensitive symbol in the US, associated with slavery and racism. The sister received it as a sentimental item from her friends' family. She doesn't display it publicly, keeping it in her bedroom, which she no longer uses. The family is from the north and doesn't support the Confederacy. The brother destroyed it without consent, leading to the sister's emotional distress.\n\nThe author found the destroyed flag, tried to salvage it and hid it, then confronted the brother. The brother doesn't acknowledge his mistake. The author is upset because the flag was a cherished memory for the sister.\n\nNow, considering the moral aspects: destroying someone's personal property, especially something with sentimental value, is generally wrong. The brother acted without consent, causing emotional harm. The author's anger is understandable as they protected their sister's feelings. The brother's actions were disrespectful and unnecessary, even if the flag is controversial.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They didn't destroy the flag themselves. They tried to help by hiding it and confronting their brother. No malicious intent. Their reaction is justified given the sister's loss and the brother's disregard. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
