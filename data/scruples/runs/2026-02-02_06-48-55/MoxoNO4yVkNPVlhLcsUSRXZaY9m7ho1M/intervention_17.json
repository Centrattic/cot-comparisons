My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for being angry at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The sister H inherited a Confederate flag that was used in battle, from her best friend's grandmother. The flag is a personal memento for her, given the family connection and the fact she doesn't display it publicly. The brother D destroyed it, considering it racist. The author found out and was upset, but didn't tell their sister. The author is now conflicted about whether they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the flag's significance as a personal, historical item, the context of the region (northern USA, no support for the Confederacy), the brother's motivation (viewing it as racist), and the author's actions (hiding the flag, not confronting the sister).\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know the opinion. \n\nI have to consider both sides. On one hand, destroying someone else's property without consent is a violation, regardless of the item. The flag, though a symbol of slavery and racism, is a personal possession to the sister. The brother's actions were disrespectful. The author, by hiding the flag and not informing the sister, might be protecting the sister from knowing her brother destroyed it, but that could also be seen as not taking responsibility or being honest.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is upset about the destruction of a meaningful item. The brother's action was wrong, but the author's response is to hide the evidence and not confront the sister. That could be seen as avoiding conflict, but maybe the author is trying to protect the sister's feelings. However, the author is in the right to be upset about the brother's actions. The author isn't the one who destroyed the flag, so they're not in the wrong for being mad. The real issue is the brother's actions.\n\nSo, the author's actions (hiding the flag) might be questionable, but the main wrongdoer is the brother. The author isn't in the wrong for being angry about the brother's destruction. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
