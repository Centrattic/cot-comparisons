My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister, H, has a Confederate flag that's a personal memento from her late friends' family. It's not displayed publicly, just in her bedroom. The brother, D, tore it up, thinking it was racist, even though the family doesn't support the Confederacy. The author is upset about this because the flag is a sentimental item for their sister.\n\nThe author didn't confront their sister yet but told their brother he was wrong. The question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nSo, the brother's actions destroyed something valuable to the sister emotionally. Even if the brother had good intentions (thinking it's racist), destroying someone else's property without consent is a problem. The author being upset makes sense because they're protecting their sister's feelings. \n\nThe key points are: 1. The flag's sentimental value. 2. The brother's unauthorized destruction. 3. The author's reaction. The author isn't the one who destroyed the flag, so they can't be in the wrong for being mad. They tried to intervene by scolding their brother. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The brother is at fault for destroying the memento without permission, and the author's anger is justified in defending their sister.\n"
