My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a brother destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited as a personal memento from her family, even though they don't support the Confederacy and it's not displayed publicly. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister's flag is a family heirloom, given by her best friend's grandmother and grandfather, who were close to her. It's kept in her bedroom, not shown publicly, and they all don't support the Confederacy. The brother destroyed it, thinking he was making a statement about racism. \n\nThe author (the person writing the AITA post) is upset about this and confronted the brother, but the brother doesn't think he was wrong. The author hid the torn flag and didn't tell the sister. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. From a moral standpoint, destroying someone's personal memento, even if it's a controversial symbol, without their consent seems wrong. The sister didn't display it publicly, and it's a sentimental item. The brother's actions were disrespectful and violated her privacy. The author's anger is justified because the brother acted without considering the sentimental value and familial relationships. \n\nHowever, maybe someone could argue that the brother had intentions to prevent the symbol from being used in a way that could be offensive. But since it was a private possession and not displayed publicly, that argument might be weaker. The key here is respect for personal property and family history. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because they're defending their sister's personal belongings and the brother acted recklessly.\n"
