My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a brother destroying a Confederate flag that his sister inherited as a personal memento. The author is upset with their brother for doing this. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the Confederate flag is a highly controversial symbol, especially in the U.S. It's associated with slavery and the Confederacy. The sister inherited it from her family as a memento, not as a public display. She doesn't live in the area anymore, and the flag is in her old bedroom. The family, including the author, doesn't support the Confederacy. The brother, D, destroyed the flag, thinking it was racist, and the author is angry about that.\n\nNow, the author's stance is that the flag was a personal item with sentimental value to the sister. The brother's action was a violation of her property and her feelings. The author took the flag out of the trash and hid it, not telling the sister what happened. The question is whether the author is wrong for being upset with their brother.\n\nFrom one angle, the brother's actions were disrespectful. The flag, while a problematic symbol, was a private memento. Destroying it without consent is a breach of trust and privacy. The fact that the sister didn't display it publicly suggests it wasn't intended to be offensive, just a personal keepsake. The brother's decision to destroy it might be seen as overstepping, even if his intention was to stand against racism. The author's anger stems from protecting their sister's feelings and respecting her property.\n\nOn the other hand, the brother might argue that the flag represents a racist history and that destroying it was a moral choice. However, the way he did it\u2014without consent\u2014could be seen as violating his sister's autonomy. The author is upset because the brother didn't consider the sentimental value and acted unilaterally.\n\nThe author's decision to hide the flag instead of confronting the sister might be seen as keeping the sister in the dark, which could be problematic if the sister wants to know what happened. But the author's motive here was to protect the sister from the brother's actions, which might have been well-intentioned but still problematic.\n\nSo, the main points are: the brother's action was a violation of personal property and respect for the sister's wishes, while the author is defending their right to be upset about that violation. The author isn't in the wrong for being angry; they're standing up for their sister's feelings and property. However, hiding the truth from the sister might be a separate issue, but the question is about the author's anger towards the brother. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
