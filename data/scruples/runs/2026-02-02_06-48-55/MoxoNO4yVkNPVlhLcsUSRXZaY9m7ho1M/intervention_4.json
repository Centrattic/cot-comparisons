My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about a brother destroying a Confederate flag that his sister inherited. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister has a Confederate flag that's a personal memento from her late friends and family. She doesn't display it publicly, just keeps it in her bedroom. The brother, who the author describes as difficult, destroyed the flag, thinking it's racist. The author is upset because they believe the flag is a sentimental item, even though they acknowledge the Confederacy's history. \n\nThe author didn't confront their sister but kept the flag hidden. They're mad at the brother for destroying it. The key points here are the intentions behind the brother's actions and the ownership of the item. The sister inherited the flag, so it's her property. The brother didn't ask permission, which is a problem. Even if the brother thought he was doing something good, destroying someone else's property without their consent is generally wrong, regardless of the reason.\n\nThe author's sister values the flag as a memory of her loved ones. The brother's action was a violation of her property and her emotional connection to it. The author is upset because they see it as an overreach, especially since the family doesn't support the Confederacy, but the flag's significance is personal. The author isn't in the wrong for being angry about their brother's actions. The brother's actions were disrespectful, and the author is protecting their sister's feelings. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
