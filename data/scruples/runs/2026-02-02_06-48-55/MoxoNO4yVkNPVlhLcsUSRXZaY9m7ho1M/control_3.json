My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe person (the author) is part of a family where their sister inherited a Confederate flag that's quite old and from battle. It's a personal momento for the sister, from her best friend's grandmother and grandfather, who were important to her. The family lives in the northern US and doesn't support the Confederacy. The sister keeps the flag in her bedroom, which she no longer sleeps in, and doesn't display it publicly. \n\nThe brother (D) destroyed the flag, tearing it up and throwing it in the trash. The author found it, tried to preserve it, didn't tell the sister, and confronted the brother, who doesn't think he did anything wrong. The author is upset about this and is asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here: The flag is a personal keepsake with sentimental value, not displayed publicly. The brother destroyed it without consent, which the author tried to stop. The author hid the flag and confronted the brother, who doesn't think it's wrong. The question is whether the author is wrong for being mad at the brother.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the brother's actions. Destroying someone's personal property without permission is generally wrong, especially if it's a sentimental item. Even if the flag is associated with a problematic history, the sister's ownership as a momento is personal. The brother made a judgment about her being racist and destroyed it, which was a violation of her personal items and their family's trust.\n\nThe author intervened by saving the flag and confronting the brother. The author didn't report it to the sister yet, but that's their choice. The question is about the author's wrongdoing. The author's anger is a reaction to the brother's actions. Since the brother did something wrong, the author isn't at fault for being upset. The author tried to mitigate damage by saving the flag, which is a responsible action. \n\nIs there any reason the author would be in the wrong? Maybe if they had supported the brother's actions or if they had a history of similar issues. But from the description, the author is clearly on the sister's side, feeling that the flag was important and the brother overstepped. The author's actions (saving the flag, confronting the brother) seem appropriate. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
