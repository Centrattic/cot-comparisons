My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The sister inherited a Confederate flag that was part of her family's history, from a friend's grandmother and grandfather. It's an old flag used in battle, and she values it as a personal memento, even though she doesn't display it publicly. The brother destroyed it by tearing it up and putting it in the trash. The author found it, tried to hide it, and confronted their brother, who doesn't think he was wrong. The author is upset about this and is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sister's ownership of the flag as a personal memento, the brother's destruction of it without consent, and the author's reaction. The author is upset because the brother destroyed something sentimental, even though they themselves are in the North and don't support the Confederacy. The author is on the side of the sister, thinking the brother was wrong.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The brother's action was disrespectful, but the author is reacting to that. The author didn't destroy the flag; they tried to save it. However, the author didn't confront the sister yet, just hid the flag. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the author is supporting their sister's right to keep the flag as a personal item, then their stance is understandable. The brother acted without permission, which is problematic. The author's anger is justified because the brother violated the sister's property. However, the author might be in the wrong if they didn't handle the situation properly, like not telling the sister or if there's a family dynamic where the brother's actions had a point. But given the context, the brother's action was a violation. The author is not the one who destroyed the flag, so they aren't directly responsible. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about their brother's actions. The answer should be B (No).\n"
