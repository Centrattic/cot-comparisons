My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Confederate flag that the sister inherited. The brother destroyed it, thinking it was racist, and the author is upset about that. The author didn't confront their sister about what happened, just hid the torn flag.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family lives in the northern USA and doesn't support the Confederacy. The sister had the flag as a personal memento from her late friends' family. It wasn't displayed publicly, so it was more of a private memory. The brother, who has a history of being difficult, destroyed it without consulting anyone, which upset the author. \n\nThe author's actions: they found the torn flag in the trash, tried to save it, but didn't tell the sister. They confronted the brother, calling him an ass. The question is whether the author is wrong for being angry at the brother and not informing the sister. \n\nThe brother's actions were definitely a problem. Destroying someone else's heirloom without their consent is a big deal, especially if it's a sentimental item. The brother didn't consider the sister's feelings or the item's significance. The author is upset because they see it as a personal momento, not a political statement. \n\nNow, the author's part: they didn't tell the sister what happened, which could be an issue. Maybe the sister should know, but the author might be protecting her from the brother's harsh actions. However, keeping it secret might prevent the sister from knowing her brother destroyed something important. But the author isn't the one who destroyed it; they tried to save the flag. \n\nIs the author wrong for being angry? Probably not. The brother acted without consideration. The author's anger towards the brother is justified because of the disrespectful act. The sister might want to know, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not telling her immediately. They might be waiting for the right time or don't want to cause conflict. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The brother's actions were the main issue here.\n"
