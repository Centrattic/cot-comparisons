My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a brother destroying a Confederate flag that the sister inherited as a personal memento. The author, who's not the brother or sister in question, found the flag torn up in the trash and hid it without telling their sister. They're asking if they're the asshole for being upset at their brother for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sister inherited the flag from her grandfather and a friend's grandmother, and it's a cherished memory for her. The brother destroyed it, thinking it was racist, but the author and their family don't support the Confederacy and the flag wasn't displayed publicly. The author is conflicted because they think the flag is a personal item but they also support their brother's stance against the Confederacy. However, they didn't tell the sister what happened, which might be an issue.\n\nSo the main points to analyze: 1. Is the brother right to destroy the flag? 2. Is the author wrong for hiding the destruction and not confronting the sister? 3. How does the family's stance on the Confederacy affect responsibility?\n\nFor the brother's action: Confederate symbols are controversial, especially in the North where the Confederacy is typically opposed. But destroying someone else's inheritance without their consent is a problem. Even if he had strong beliefs, he shouldn't have acted unilaterally. The sister might have historical or sentimental reasons for keeping it. So the brother might be in the wrong for taking it without discussion. The author is upset with him, which is understandable.\n\nAuthor's action: They hid the torn flag instead of informing the sister. That's a lie of omission. The sister has a right to know her memento was destroyed. The author might be protecting their brother or not wanting to cause conflict, but withholding the truth could be seen as unethical. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out later. So the author could be in the wrong for not being honest with the sister.\n\nThe family's position is that they don't support the Confederacy publicly, but the flag was a private, personal item. The brother acted on his own to destroy it, which the author disapproves of. The author's moral dilemma is between their brother's actions and the sister's feelings. However, hiding the truth from the sister is a separate issue. The author's actions might not be justified, even if they see the brother as the one at fault.\n\nSo, if the author is not in the wrong, then the answer is B. But if hiding the destruction is wrong, maybe A. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at their brother and hiding the fact. The author is upset with the brother (which they might have a right to be, if the brother destroyed the flag without consent), but also hid the destruction from the sister. The sister's right to know her memento was destroyed is a key point. The author didn't act to inform her, which could be a problem. So maybe the author is also in the wrong for not being truthful with the sister. Alternatively, they might not be the one who destroyed it, so their responsibility is less. But the sister's feelings are important here. The author might have a duty to let the sister know, even if they didn't do it. So if they're keeping it secret, that's where the wrong lies. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong for not informing the sister. But I'm a bit torn. Let me check again. The author's main action is being angry at the brother (so they're not in the wrong for that) but hiding the destruction. If the sister has the right to know, then the author is in the wrong for not telling her. The author might think it's a personal issue, but the sister would want to know. So the answer is A.\n"
