My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a brother destroying a Confederate flag that the sister inherited. The author is upset about this because the flag is a personal memento for the sister, even though they all live in the North and don't support the Confederacy. The brother did this without asking, just because he thought it was racist. The author didn't tell the sister about the destroyed flag.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the brother's actions. He took it upon himself to destroy something that was a cherished item for his sister. Even if he had a point about the flag's symbolism, destroying someone else's personal property without their consent is a problem. The sister received it as a gift and it has sentimental value. The brother might have thought he was doing the right thing by opposing racism, but his method was extreme and disrespectful.\n\nNow, the author didn't confront the sister. They hid the flag instead of telling her. Maybe they didn't want to cause a bigger conflict or hurt her feelings by revealing her brother's actions. But on the other hand, the author is now hiding this from the sister, which could lead to more issues. The author is also angry at the brother, which makes sense because he destroyed something precious.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't destroy the flag. They tried to salvage it and protect the sister's feelings. However, by not telling her the truth, they might be enabling the brother's behavior. But the brother's action was definitely problematic. The author's main issue is with the brother's decision to destroy the flag without consent. Since the author's actions were to prevent further harm and protect the sister's emotions, maybe they aren't in the wrong. The key points are consent and respecting personal items, even if their symbolism is controversial. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
