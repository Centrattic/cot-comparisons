My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying their sister's Confederate flag. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The brother destroyed the flag, which the sister inherited as a personal memento. The author is upset because the flag was torn up. The family is in the northern US and doesn't support the Confederacy, but the flag is a personal item.\n\nThe key points here are ownership and intent. The sister owned the flag, so the brother destroying it without her consent might be an issue. But the brother might argue that the flag is a symbol of racism and he was trying to remove it. However, taking it without asking is a problem. The author didn't confront the sister about it, which could be a point against them. Also, the author might feel they have to protect the family's feelings but maybe the brother overstepped. \n\nSo, the author's actions involve hiding the flag without telling the sister. That could be seen as hiding the truth, which isn't ideal. The author is angry at the brother for destroying it, but maybe should have handled it differently, like talking to the sister first. \n\nOn the other hand, the brother's action was impulsive and disrespectful. The author is caught in the middle. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author didn't confront the sister or the brother properly, maybe they are partially at fault. But the brother's actions might be worse. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the brother destroyed someone else's property without consent. However, the author's choice to hide the flag instead of addressing the sister might be a mistake. But overall, the main issue is the brother's action. So the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
