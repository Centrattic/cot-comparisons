My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited. \n\nFirst, the context: the sister H has a Confederate flag that's a family heirloom, given to her by friends' grandparents. It's not displayed publicly, just in her bedroom, which she no longer uses. The brother D, who's described as difficult but not entirely unkind, destroyed the flag, thinking it was racist. The author is upset because they believe the flag is a personal memento, and D's action was wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the value of the flag as a sentimental item versus the brother's belief that it's a racist symbol. The family lives in the North and doesn't support the Confederacy, but the flag is a personal keepsake. \n\nThe author didn't support the brother's action and tried to hide the flag's remnants to protect their sister. The brother, however, doesn't think he did anything wrong. The author is angry at the brother for destroying something that had emotional value.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author's anger is directed at the brother for destroying a family heirloom without consent. The brother acted on his own judgment, which may be based on his values, but he did so without considering the sentimental value. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about that. They're standing up for their sister's emotional attachment.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't confront the sister directly. They hid the flag instead. That might be seen as not being honest with the sister, but the question is about the author's anger at the brother. The author's right to be angry is about the brother's actions, not about hiding the flag. So the author's anger is justified if they believe the brother overstepped. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the brother's action was a violation of the sister's property and sentiment. The author is right to be upset with the brother for that. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
