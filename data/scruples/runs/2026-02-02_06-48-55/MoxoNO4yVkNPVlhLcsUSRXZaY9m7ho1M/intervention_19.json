My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag their sister inherited. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The brother destroyed the flag, which the sister received as a personal memento from her late friends' family. The family lives in the northern US and doesn't support the Confederacy, but the flag is a private item with sentimental value. The sister doesn't display it publicly anymore.\n\nThe brother's action was tearing the flag, which the author found and tried to hide. The author is upset and called the brother an \"ass,\" but the brother doesn't think he did anything wrong. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Did the brother overstep by destroying someone else's property without consent? The flag was the sister's, so the brother had no right to destroy it. The author's reaction is anger towards the brother, which is justified because the brother violated the sister's ownership and emotional value. However, the author didn't confront the sister about the flag's destruction. Instead, they hid the pieces. \n\nBut wait, the author's mistake might be not informing the sister about what happened. By not telling her, the author is perhaps protecting the brother, which might not be right. However, the main issue is the brother's action. The author isn't in the wrong for being angry at the brother for destroying the flag. The author's actions (collecting the flag, hiding it) might be questionable in terms of not informing the sister, but the anger towards the brother seems justified.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue the author should have addressed the sister's ownership rights first. However, the brother's act was a clear violation. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry; the brother's actions are the problem. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
