My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being mad at their brother for destroying a Confederate flag their sister inherited. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The sister inherited the flag from her best friend's grandmother, who had it from her grandfather. It's a personal memento, not displayed publicly. The family is in the north and doesn't support the Confederacy. The brother destroyed it, thinking it was racist. The author is upset and hid the flag without telling their sister.\n\nSo, the main points here are the sister's emotional attachment to the item, the brother's actions based on his views on racism, and the author's response. The question is whether the author is wrong for being angry and hiding the flag.\n\nWell, the author isn't wrong for being angry. The brother destroyed something with sentimental value without consent. Even if the brother had a point about the flag's historical context, he acted without considering the emotional impact. The author's actions of hiding the flag to protect their sister's feelings seem protective and considerate. They didn't confront the sister yet, which might be to shield her from the hurtful act. \n\nBut is the author wrong in any way? Maybe not acting on hiding the flag? But the sister's feelings matter here. The brother overstepped by destroying a personal item without discussion. The author's reaction is understandable. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
