My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a brother destroying a Confederate flag that his sister inherited. The author is the one who found out and didn't tell the sister, but hid the flag.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family is in the northern USA and doesn't support the Confederacy. The sister had this flag as a personal memento from her friends' family. It's not on display publicly, just in her bedroom, which she doesn't even use anymore. The brother destroyed it, thinking it was a racist symbol, but the author is upset with him for doing that. \n\nThe author is the one who's mad at the brother, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The sister's flag was a personal item with sentimental value. The brother, despite his personality issues, acted on his own without discussing it with her. The author didn't confront the sister or tell her what happened, instead hiding the flag. \n\nIs the author wrong for being upset with the brother? Well, the brother destroyed something valuable to the sister without her consent. Even if the author agrees with the brother's political stance, the act of destroying someone else's property without permission is a big issue. The author is protecting the sister's feelings by not telling her, which might be good, but the brother's actions were wrong regardless. \n\nBut the author is mad at the brother for doing that. So the author isn't in the wrong for being angry. The brother is the one who destroyed the flag. The author's actions (hiding the flag) prevent further conflict, but that's not necessarily wrong. The key point is that the brother's actions were the initial wrongdoing. The author is reacting to that, so their anger is justified. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
