My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset with their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The brother destroyed the flag, which the sister inherited as a personal memento from her grandparents. The family is in the northern US and doesn't support the Confederacy, but the flag has sentimental value. The author is upset with their brother for tearing it up without considering the emotional significance.\n\nThe key points here are the emotional value of the item versus the brother's actions based on his opposition to the Confederacy. The brother might have thought he was doing something right by destroying a symbol associated with racism, but the sister sees it as a personal keepsake. The author is defending their sister's right to keep it as a private memento, even if it's from a problematic history.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're standing up for their sister's feelings and the sentimental value of the item. The brother acted without considering her perspective, so the author's anger is justified. The answer should be B (No).\n"
