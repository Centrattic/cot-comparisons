My brother is an overall pretty hard to get along with person, he has a way of turning any event miserable. But when he isn't being grumpy he's pretty nice to be around and have conversation with. \nMy brother and I both moved away from out hometown to the nearest city, and we came home to visit over Christmas break for obvious reasons. While at home I stayed at my dad's house on the couch, and my brother and his GF in my sister's old bedroom since she lives with her BF now. My sister has a very old Confederate flag that was used in battle (from what I've been told- and it looks like it) hanging over her bed. She received this flag from her best friends grandmother when she passed, and before that it belonged to her grandfather who were both very near and dear to my sister. This was the only item she had to remember them. \nNow, to touch on the subject, we live in northern USA and in no way, shape, or form support the Confederacy.. but this is more of a personal momento in my opinion. She would never display it publically, it was in her bedroom that she doesn't even sleep in anymore. \nWhile we were home for Christmas I walk in the room to see my brother and notice the flag is missing. I instantly know D went ahead and made some bold statement about how racist she is to own something like that and got rid of it.... Low and behold, I look in the trash and hidden under a bunch of bags is the flag torn to shreds. I collected it and folded it as best I could and hid it somewhere else he would never look at. I don't have the heart to tell her. I told him he\u2019s an absolute ass for doing that to her and he doesn\u2019t think what he did is wrong. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset with their brother for destroying a Confederate flag that their sister inherited. Let me break down the context.\n\nFirst, the brother (D) destroyed the flag, which the sister (H) got from her friend's grandmother. She keeps it as a personal memento, not publicly displayed. The family is in the Northern US and doesn't support the Confederacy. The author is upset that D trashed the flag, seeing it as a personal item with sentimental value. The author didn't confront their sister but tried to hide the flag. The brother doesn't think he was wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the key points. The sister didn't display the flag publicly, it's a personal keepsake. The brother acted without consent, destroying it. The author is upset because it was a meaningful item. The brother's actions were destructive and disrespectful. The author tried to protect the sister by hiding the flag, which shows they didn't want to make her upset.\n\nIs the author wrong for being angry at their brother? Probably not. The brother's actions were disrespectful. The author's anger is justified as they value the sister's sentimental item. The author didn't do anything wrong except maybe not telling the sister, but that might be to protect her feelings. The main issue is the brother's actions. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
