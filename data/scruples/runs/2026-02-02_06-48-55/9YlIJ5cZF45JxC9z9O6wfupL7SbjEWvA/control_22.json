I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they gave a $5 bill to two girls who asked for money, but the older girl then said they wanted $20. The author took back the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but the author isn't sure.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the sequence of events. The author was giving money to the girls. Initially, they offered $5, but the older girl asked for $20. So the author took back the $5 and walked away. The key points here are the initial offer, the request for more, and the author's response.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they were willing to give $5 but the girls wanted more. The author then changed their mind and took back the $5. The girlfriend's reaction is that this was rude. But why would the author take back the money? Maybe because they didn't want to give more than they intended, or they realized they made a mistake in giving the $5 in the first place when they were asked for $20.\n\nNow, considering the girls' situation: they were not in obvious distress, not homeless, and just seemed untidy. So maybe the author felt the girls weren't in real need. But the act of giving money and then retracting it could be seen as a bit of a sting operation. The initial giving of $5 might have been a mistake because the girls had asked for $20. Then the author took back the $5, which could be perceived as mocking or playing them.\n\nBut does that make the author wrong? Well, giving money to someone is a charitable act, and once given, it's theirs. However, the author didn't give the $20, so maybe they didn't have the intention to give more. The problem is that the author gave $5 but then took it back when the girls wanted $20. That might be seen as a bait-and-switch. If the author realized they had made a mistake in giving the $5 because they thought the girls asked for $20 first, but in reality, the girl said \"We want $20 please\" after receiving the $5, which changes the dynamics.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author thought that by giving $5, they were meeting their charitable limit, and when the girl asked for $20, they realized they had overextended and tried to take back the $5. However, once money is given, you can't take it back. So taking it back might be ethically questionable, even if the person feels they were misled.\n\nAnother angle is the children's age. Interacting with children who are asking for money can be tricky. If the children are acting on their own, the author might have a different responsibility than if they were being coached by someone else. The description mentions they were probably sisters, so maybe they were just asking for money without ulterior motives.\n\nThe author's action of taking back the $5 could be seen as a breach of trust or a form of deception. Even if the author felt the girls weren't in real need, the act of giving and then retracting money is confusing. The girlfriend's reaction is that it's a dick move, which suggests that in social terms, it's considered impolite or inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they were being asked for $20, gave $5 thinking it was a mistake, and then corrected it. But the problem is that once you give someone money, it's theirs. Taking it back without their consent could be seen as wrong. Unless there was some sort of misunderstanding or fraud involved, which isn't clear here.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because they gave the money and then took it back, which is not typically acceptable. Even if they felt misled, the action of retrieving the money after the fact is what's causing the issue. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
