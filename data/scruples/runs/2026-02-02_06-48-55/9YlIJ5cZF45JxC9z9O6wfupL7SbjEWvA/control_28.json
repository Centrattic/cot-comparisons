I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back the $5 after giving it to the kids.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author gave $5 to two girls, but then when they asked for $20, he took back the $5 and left. The girlfriend says it's a dick move, but the author is unsure. The girls were not obviously in need, just untidy but clean, and not homeless.\n\nHmm. So, the initial act of giving $5 was charitable, but when the girls asked for more, the author changed his mind. The key here is whether he had an obligation to give the $20 once he gave the $5. \n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong because there's no binding contract. When you give money to someone in need, it's a one-time action. If they ask for more, you can decide not to give again. But morally, it's a different story. The author gave $5 then took it back when asked for $20. That might come across as deceptive or disrespectful, especially to children. \n\nThe girls might have felt embarrassed or tricked. Even if the author didn't have to give the $20, taking back the $5 could be seen as a breach of trust. The author's actions might be considered inconsiderate because the children were in a vulnerable position. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that others might view this as a poor move. The author could have just said no to the $20 request without taking back the $5. That way, he avoids the awkwardness and potential harm to the kids' feelings. \n\nSo, while the author isn't legally wrong, morally, he might be. The answer likely is A (the author is in the wrong) because of the ethical implications of taking back the money and the impact on the children.\n"
