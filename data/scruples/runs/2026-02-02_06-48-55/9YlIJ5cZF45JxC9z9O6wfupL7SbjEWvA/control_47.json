I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story did something wrong by taking back the $5 after the girl initially asked for $20. \n\nFirst, the scenario: The person gives $5 to a girl and her sister, but when the girl says they actually wanted $20, he takes the $5 back and offers a $20 bill instead. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but the author isn't sure.\n\nNow, the key points. The initial act was giving $5, which was an immediate donation. Then, upon realizing the girl wanted more, the person took back the $5 and gave a $20. The question is whether this was wrong.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. When someone asks for money, the donor can decide how much to give. If the recipient then changes the amount they want, does the donor have to honor that? Probably not. The donor is under no obligation to give more than they're willing. However, taking back the $5 might be seen as deceptive. The person might be accused of using a trick to get a larger donation. \n\nWait, but the author says the girls looked untidy but not homeless. Maybe they were just trying to get more money, not in dire need. The author might have realized this and decided not to give more. But the act of taking back the $5 to give a larger bill could be perceived as manipulative. \n\nAnother angle: when the girl asked for $20 after receiving $5, the author could have just given the $20 instead of taking the $5 back. Taking back the $5 and then giving a $20 might be seen as a way to make it look like the donation was more generous, but in reality, the net amount is the same. However, if the girls were trying to get more, the author might have been testing them or realized they were being taken advantage of.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she thinks the author was rude. The author's action might have been abrupt and could have been handled more politely. Instead of taking the money back, maybe he could have said, \"I can give you $20 if you need it more.\" But the way he did it might have embarrassed the girls or been seen as condescending.\n\nAlso, the girls not being in obvious need might be a factor. If they were genuinely in need, taking back the money might be less justifiable. But if they were just asking for more than necessary, the author's action might be a way to prevent giving more than intended.\n\nIn terms of legal wrong, there's probably nothing. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author had the right to change his mind, but the method might have been inconsiderate. The key is whether the action was respectful and considerate of the girls' situation. If the author thought they were not in genuine need, maybe he was right to adjust, but the way he did it could be seen as dismissive.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on intent and method. The author's intent might have been to not overdonate, but the method could have been rude. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because of how the situation was handled, not necessarily the act of changing the donation amount.\n"
