I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving $5 to a 12-year-old girl and her sister, then trying to take it back when the girl asks for $20 instead.\n\nFirst, the author gave $5 to the girl, who then said they wanted $20. So the author took back the $5 and gave nothing else. The girlfriend says it was a dick move, but the author isn't sure. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let me break it down. When someone asks for money, and you give them some, you can't really take it back once you've handed it over. But in this case, the author gave $5, then when the girl asked for more, he took the $5 back. That seems a bit underhanded. \n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the author gave the $5 and then tried to reverse the transaction. Normally, if you give money to someone, you can't take it back unless they give it back. But the author took the money back without giving anything else in exchange. That might be manipulative. \n\nAlso, the girls weren't in dire need according to the author's description. They were tidy but maybe not in poverty. So maybe the author's initial intention was to give a small donation, but then changed his mind when the girl asked for more. \n\nBut the key point is that the author took back the money he had already given. That's not a common practice. If you hand someone money, you can't just take it back. So the author's action could be seen as dishonest or taking advantage of the situation. \n\nThe author's girlfriend says it's a dick move, which suggests that others might view it that way. The girl might have expected the $5 as a gift, and the author's action of taking it back could have been hurtful or confusing. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for retracting the money after giving it. The right approach would have been to either give the $20 if they could or apologize and say they can't give more. Taking back the $5 seems like a breach of trust.\n"
