I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to get pizza, gave $5 to a girl who asked for money, then the girl said they actually wanted $20. The person took back the $5 and walked away. Now they're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, when the person gave the $5, it was out of goodwill, probably expecting that $5 was enough. The girl then changed the request to $20. If the person didn't have the means to give $20, they might be justified in taking back the $5. But if they were okay with giving $5 but the girl wanted more, maybe that's where the issue is.\n\nThe girlfriend says it was a dick move. Maybe because she thought the person should stick to their word once they gave the money. But the person tried to give $5, and when the girl asked for more, they took back the $5. The description mentions the girls looked untidy but not homeless. So maybe the person felt they were being taken advantage of. \n\nBut taking back the money after giving it could be seen as dishonest. If the person gave the $5 with the intention of helping, then retracting it might be perceived as a lack of generosity. However, if the person realized they were being manipulated and decided not to give more, maybe they had a right to take back the $5. \n\nThe key point is whether the girl's request for $20 was genuine or if she was trying to get more money. If the person thought they were being asked for more than initially intended, taking back the money could be a way to not overcommit. But if the girl just wanted $20 from the start and the $5 was a ploy to get closer, the person might be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, once the $5 was given, retracting it could be seen as breaking trust. The person might have expected the $5 to be accepted, and changing the request could be a trick. However, the person tried to honor the new request by offering $20 but then took the $5 back when they couldn't fulfill it. \n\nConsidering both sides, it's a bit ambiguous. The person might have felt they were being manipulated, so taking back the money was a way to not give more than they intended. But the act of taking back the money after giving it could be seen as dishonest. So, maybe the person is partially at fault for not committing to the $5 if they weren't sure about giving $20. Alternatively, they might not be at fault if they realized the request was misleading. \n\nI think the main issue is that once a donation is given, retracting it can be seen as disrespectful. The person might have been better off just giving the $5 and not engaging further. So maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the girl was trying to get more money, the person's action is understandable. The description says the girls weren't homeless, so maybe they were just begging. The person might have felt they were being asked for more than they intended, so taking back the $5 was a way to not give more. In that case, B (not in the wrong) could be the answer. \n\nI need to weigh the social expectations here. If someone gives money with the understanding that it's a donation, retracting it could be seen as a breach of trust. However, if the initial donation was given under a misunderstanding (thinking the girl wanted $5 but she wanted $20), then taking it back is a way to correct that mistake. So the person might not be in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
