I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back the money after initially giving $5 to two girls asking for $20. \n\nFirst, the man gives $5 to the older girl, who then says they want $20. He takes back the $5 and leaves. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but he's unsure. The girls are described as looking untidy but not homeless.\n\nSo, the key points: Did he act wrongly by taking the money back? The initial action was a spontaneous donation, but when the older girl ups the amount, he takes back the $5. The question is about whether that's inappropriate.\n\nLegally, there's no obligation to give money in the first place. The man can choose to give any amount he wants. When the girl asks for more, he's within his rights to take back the money. However, the social aspect is tricky. The older girl's behavior might have been manipulative, expecting a higher donation after receiving a smaller one. \n\nThe author's action could be seen as realizing the initial $5 wasn't enough and deciding not to give more. The problem is if he gave with the expectation of giving $5 and then took it back. But since the girl changed the request, maybe he felt misled. However, the girls' appearance as not homeless might make others question their need, but that's not his to judge. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she thinks it's harsh. But the author might argue that the initial $5 was a mistake because the girl asked for $20, so he corrected it. Alternatively, people might view taking the money back as stingy or not trusting the situation. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if someone gives money out of kindness but then realizes the person is being opportunistic, taking it back could be justified. However, once given, retracting it might be seen as rude or not respecting the gesture. \n\nSo, the answer depends on perspective. If the man felt the initial $5 was too much and the girl was taking advantage, then B (not in the wrong). If the act of taking back the money was seen as a breach of good faith, then A (wrong). Given the context, the author might be in the right because he had the right to change his mind, especially if the girl ups the amount. But others might argue that once given, even if it's an error, you shouldn't take it back. However, the fact that the girl asked for $20 first might have influenced his decision. The key is that he wasn't obligated to give in the first place. So, the answer is B.\n"
