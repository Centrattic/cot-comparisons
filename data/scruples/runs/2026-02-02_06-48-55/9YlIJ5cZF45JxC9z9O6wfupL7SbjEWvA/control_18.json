I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is, the person gives a $5 bill to a girl who asked for money, but then the girl says they actually want $20. The person then takes back the $5 and walks away. Their girlfriend thinks it was a dick move. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions of both parties. The author gave $5 thinking it was sufficient, but the child changed the request. Did the author have any obligation to give more? Well, when someone asks for money, the giver can decide how much to give. The child's request for $20 after receiving $5 might be a way to get more, but the author was within their right to not give more if they didn't want to.\n\nBut wait, maybe the child was trying to manipulate by asking for $5 first to get the author to give that, then asking for more. However, the author didn't have to agree to the $20. The key point is that the author gave $5, but when the child asked for $20, the author took back the $5. Was that taking back necessary? If the author had already given the $5, taking it back to give a different amount could be seen as rude. But if the author didn't want to give more, maybe they should have just kept walking instead of taking back the money they had already given.\n\nWait, the author gave the $5, then the child said they wanted $20. The author then took back the $5 to give $20. But the author didn't give $20. So they took back the $5 and refused. The problem is that taking back the $5 might be seen as a reversal, which the child might not expect. If the author had just said no to the $20 request without taking back the $5, maybe that would have been better. But taking back the money could be seen as a way to avoid giving more, but maybe the child was just trying to get more, and the author was trying to correct their initial mistake. \n\nAnother angle: the author gave $5, then the child said they wanted $20. The author might have realized they should have given the $20 from the start. But by taking back the $5, maybe the author is treating the child as a negotiator, which isn't appropriate. Alternatively, if the child was trying to get more money by changing their request, the author is not obligated to comply. However, taking back the $5 after giving it might be seen as a bit of a trick move, which could come off as rude or deceptive.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girls didn't look impoverished. So maybe they were just asking for money for a non-essential reason. The author might feel they were being taken advantage of. But the act of giving money is usually optional. If the author changed their mind after giving the money, that's their choice, but taking it back could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn terms of social norms, once you give money, taking it back can be awkward. The author might have been better off not giving the $5 in the first place if they were unsure about the amount. Alternatively, if they realized they should give more, they could have given the $20 and kept the $5, but they didn't. Instead, they took back the $5, which might have been confusing or disrespectful to the child.\n\nSo, the author's action of taking back the $5 after initially giving it could be seen as wrong because it's taking back a gift or donation after the fact, which might not be the best approach. It could be considered rude to retract a donation once it's given, especially if the recipient is expecting to keep it. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not following through politely and instead retracting the money, which could be seen as a manipulation of the situation.\n\nBut another perspective is that the author had the right to correct their mistake. If they realized they should have given $20, but then decided not to, taking back the $5 to give the correct amount makes sense. However, since they didn't end up giving $20, it's like they took back the money they had already given, which might be seen as a step back in generosity. The key is whether the author had the right to take back the money after giving it. Since it's a donation, once given, it's the recipient's. Taking it back could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the child was relying on that $5. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because taking back the money after giving it could be considered a breach of trust or inconsiderate. The appropriate action would have been to either give the correct amount initially or not take back the money they had already given.\n"
