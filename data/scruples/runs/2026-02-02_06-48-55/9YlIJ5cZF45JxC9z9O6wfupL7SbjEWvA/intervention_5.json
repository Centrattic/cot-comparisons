I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to two girls, and then when they asked for $20 instead, he took back the $5. The main question is whether he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, charity is usually voluntary. When someone asks for money, you can choose how much to give. If the person gave $5, that was their choice. Then, when the girls changed their request to $20, the person decided to retract the $5. But wait, once you give money, it's a transfer. Taking it back after handing it over might be an issue. Did he give the $5 and then take it back? If he gave the $5 and then asked for it back, maybe he should have just kept the $5 and said no to the $20. But in his case, he took the $5 back and replaced it with $20. But the girls might have thought he was giving the $5 as a donation, so taking it back could be seen as manipulative. Also, the person's girlfriend called it a dick move. The guy might have thought he was being generous but overstepped by taking back the money. The girls' appearance wasn't in dire straits, so maybe the person felt they weren't in need. But taking back the money after giving it was a poor choice. So the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
