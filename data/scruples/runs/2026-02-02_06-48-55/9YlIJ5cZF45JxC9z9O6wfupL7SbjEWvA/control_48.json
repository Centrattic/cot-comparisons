I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author giving $5 to two girls who asked for money, then the older girl changing her mind and asking for $20. The author takes back the $5 and walks away. The girlfriend is upset, calling it a dick move.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author gave $5 voluntarily, then the girl asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5. The girl's appearance isn't indicating extreme poverty. So, was it wrong to take back the money?\n\nCharity is typically a voluntary act. The author isn't obligated to give money, especially when the request changes. If someone asks for more money after you've already given, it's reasonable to reassess. The author isn't forced to follow through on a new request. Also, the girls' not being in dire straits might make the initial $5 a generous act, but the author isn't wrong for not giving more. The girlfriend's reaction is about the author's action, but legally and ethically, the author isn't in the wrong because they can revoke their offer before the transaction is finalized. So the answer is B.\n"
