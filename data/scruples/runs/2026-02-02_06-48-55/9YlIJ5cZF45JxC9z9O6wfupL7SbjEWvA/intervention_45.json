I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person went to get pizza, got approached by two kids asking for money. They gave $5 first, then when told they wanted $20, took back the $5. The girlfriend says it was a dick move, but the person isn't sure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The kids asked for money. The person gave $5 but then took it back when the older kid asked for $20. The author's reasoning is that they thought they could give $20, took back the $5 to give the higher amount. But the action of taking back the $5 might be seen as deceptive or a trick. \n\nIf the person gave the $5 as a donation, then when the kid asks for more, the person is reversing that donation. That could be seen as taking money away from someone in need. But the author mentions the kids didn't look homeless or impoverished, which might make some question their request. However, the act of taking back money that was already given, even if it was a mistake, is where the ethical dilemma lies. \n\nIn many cultures, once you give money to someone, it's considered a gift, especially in a situation like this. The person might have thought they could change their mind, but by taking it back, they could be seen as being inconsiderate or taking advantage. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that this could be perceived as rude. \n\nOn the other hand, the person might not have intended to give $20 initially and realized they couldn't commit to that amount. But instead of just refusing, they took back the $5, which could be seen as a dishonest way to back out of a larger donation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author likely is in the wrong because they took back money that was given, which is considered a gift in that context. Even if they made a mistake, the action of retrieving the money is seen as disrespectful. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
