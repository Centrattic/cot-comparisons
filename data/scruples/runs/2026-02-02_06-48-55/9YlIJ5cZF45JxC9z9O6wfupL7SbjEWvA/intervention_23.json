I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking back the $5 they gave to a kid. So the situation is that the author gave $5 to a girl and her sister, but when the girl asked for $20 instead, the author took the $5 back. His girlfriend thinks it's a dick move.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. When someone donates money, they usually expect it to be given freely. But in this case, the author gave $5 and then the girl requested $20. The author then took the money back. The key point here is whether the author had an obligation to give the $20 once the $5 was given.\n\nThe author might argue that they made a mistake in giving the $5 because the girl later asked for more. However, once the money is given, it's a completed transaction. Taking it back after the fact could be seen as dishonest or manipulative. The girl might have felt tricked or that the author was toying with them. Even if the girls weren't in dire need, the act of taking back the money could be perceived as a betrayal of trust.\n\nThe author's action of walking away after taking the $5 back might be seen as abrupt and not considerate of the children's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she thinks it was rude because giving money is a charitable act, and retracting it seems insincere. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that they were taken advantage of. The girl initially said they wanted money, so getting $5, then changing the amount could be seen as a setup. But the author's response of taking back the $5 and offering $20 might be a way to correct the mistake, but doing it in a way that's not respectful.\n\nAnother angle is the social contract aspect. When someone gives charity, they might expect it to be accepted as a gift. The author's action of taking it back could be seen as a violation of that implicit understanding. Even if the author felt misled, the way they handled the situation could have been more compassionate. Maybe explaining that they couldn't give more instead of taking the money back.\n\nI should also consider the children's ages. At 12 and 6, they might not be in a position to understand the complexities of the situation. The author's actions might have confused or upset them. The fact that they were not in obvious need (like not homeless) might reduce the urgency of the donation, but the act of giving and then retracting is still questionable.\n\nIn some cases, people might think that giving money to children could lead to exploitation, but in this case, the situation is different because the author gave money and then changed their mind. The ethical issue here is about honesty and respect. Once the $5 was given, taking it back could be seen as a breach of trust, even if the initial giving was a mistake. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably is in the wrong because they gave the money and then retracted it, which can be seen as dishonest or disrespectful. The better approach might have been to give the $5 and not offer more, or not give anything in the first place if they felt the situation was a setup. Retracting the money after the fact is problematic.\n"
