I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving $5 to two girls who asked for money but then taking it back when they asked for $20 instead. The girlfriend says it was a dick move, but the author is unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author gave $5 initially, thinking it was enough. Then the girl said they wanted $20. The author took the $5 back, saying they would get a $20 instead. The key points here are the initial act of giving money, the change in the amount requested, and the author's response.\n\nThe author might argue that they were being taken advantage of. The girls might have known they could get more money by changing their request. However, the girls looked untidy but not homeless, which complicates the situation. There's a question of whether the author was being too quick to assume intent to scam versus genuine need.\n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong because there's no law against retracting a donation once given, especially if the terms (the amount) change after the fact. However, ethically, it's a gray area. The author gave money in good faith, but upon realizing the request was higher, they decided not to proceed. The problem is that the initial $5 was a gift, and taking it back after accepting might be seen as deceptive or rude, especially if the girls were in need. \n\nSome might say the girls could have just asked for $20 from the start, but the author didn't ask their full request. The author's action was a reaction to the new information. On the other hand, taking the money back might have embarrassed or upset the girls, especially the younger one. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the move was perceived as mean, which adds a social context.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and expectations. In many cases, people don't expect to have to negotiate amounts when giving to someone in need. If the girls were genuinely in need, the author's action could be seen as stingy or distrustful. But if the author felt the initial amount was a mistake, there's a case for them not being in the wrong. The fact that the girls weren't obviously in dire straits might make people more likely to side with the author, thinking they\u907f\u514d being taken advantage of.\n\nHowever, the act of taking back the money after giving it could be seen as rude or untrustworthy. The author's approach might have been better if they had simply said they couldn't give $20 without taking back the $5. But since they took it back, some might see it as a betrayal of trust. The answer hinges on whether the author's action was a reasonable response to a change in request versus being unkind.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't legally wrong, there's an ethical or social aspect where their action might be seen as inconsiderate. The answer would depend on the perspective, but since the user is asking for a judgment, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because taking the money back after giving it could be seen as rude and potentially harmful to the girls' feelings, especially if they were genuinely in need. However, the girls not being impoverished might shift the perspective. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author didn't have to give money and realized it was a higher request. It's tricky. I need to weigh both sides. The initial act was generous, but retracting it might be seen as a mistake. The answer is likely B, as the author is within their rights and the girls could have asked for $20 first. The author's action is not wrong.\n"
