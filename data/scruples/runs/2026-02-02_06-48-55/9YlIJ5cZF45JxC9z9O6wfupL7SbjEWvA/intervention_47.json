I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author gave $5 to a girl and her sister, who asked for money. The girl then asked for $20 instead, so the author took back the $5. The girlfriend says it was a dick move.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author initially gave $5, which is a small amount. The girl then asked for $20. The author decided to take back the $5 to give $20, but that's not actually what happened. The author didn't give the $20; they just took back the $5. So the author didn't follow through on the promise to exchange the $5 for $20. Instead, they just took the money back, which might come off as deceptive or stingy.\n\nThe girls' appearance is mentioned as untidy but not homeless. That's a red flag for potential scamming. However, the author's reaction was to take back the money instead of giving $20. Normally, when someone asks for money, it's a charitable act. If the author initially gave $5, and then the girl asked for more, the author could have just said no and kept the $5. But by taking it back, the author might be perceived as mocking or tricking the girls, which could be seen as rude or inconsiderate, even if the author thought the girls were trying to get more money.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction that it was a dick move suggests that the author's action was inappropriate. The key here is that the author didn't actually give more money but took the original money back after being asked for more. That could be seen as a breach of trust or an insincere act. Even if the author suspected the girls weren't truly in need, taking back the money after already giving it might be considered dishonest or stingy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were being cautious, noticing the girls weren't in dire straits, and decided to retract the money. But the action of taking it back could be seen as impolite. The right approach might have been to say no and keep the $5 without taking it back. \n\nSo, considering the potential for the action to be perceived as rude or deceptive, the author is probably in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
