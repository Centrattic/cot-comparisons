I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to two girls who asked for money. The older girl then said they wanted $20. The author took back the $5 and walked away. The question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the initial act of giving $5 seems generous. The problem arises when the older girl changes the request to $20. The author decides to take back the $5 and walk off. The girlfriend says it's a dick move. So, why might the author be in the wrong?\n\nWell, when you give someone a gift, taking it back could be seen as rude. The author might have realized that the initial donation was $5, and the girls upping the request was unexpected. But taking back the money after giving it could be perceived as stingy or not being genuine. People might expect that if you're going to help, you should follow through. If the author didn't want to give $20, maybe they should have just said no initially instead of giving $5 and then retracting it.\n\nOn the other hand, the girls didn't look impoverished, so maybe the author felt it was a scam or not genuine. But the author had the option to not give any money in the first place. Once they gave the $5, taking it back could be seen as a breach of trust. The author's action might have embarrassed the girls or made the girls feel manipulated. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author's actions could be viewed as being inconsiderate. They gave money, then took it back, which might have been hurtful. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). However, others might argue that the author wasn't obligated to give more. But the key point is that taking back the money after giving it might be seen as a mistake. I think the answer is A.\n"
