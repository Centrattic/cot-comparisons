I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about giving a kid $5 and then taking it back when the kid asked for more. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the person gave $5 to a girl and her sister, then when the girl changed her mind and asked for $20, the author took back the $5. The girlfriend says it's a dick move. The key points here are intent and perception.\n\nWhen someone gives money, it's a voluntary act. If the recipient changes their request, the giver isn't obligated to comply. The author isn't in the wrong by taking back the money because they didn't promise any specific amount. However, the way it was handled might come off as abrupt or rude. The girls might have felt misled or the author's behavior could be seen as manipulative if there was a trick involved. But the author claims they just walked away after retrieving the $5. \n\nThe girls' appearance isn't impoverished, so maybe the initial request was genuine but perhaps they wanted more. The author's action was a right to take back their money, but maybe the approach could have been more courteous. However, there's no indication of deception from the author. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but the nuance is that the approach could be seen as insensitive. But legally and morally, the author isn't wrong because they can take back their money. So I think B is the answer.\n"
