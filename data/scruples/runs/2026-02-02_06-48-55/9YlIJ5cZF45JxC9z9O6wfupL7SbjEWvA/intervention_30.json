I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story did something wrong by taking back the $5 after being asked for $20.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The person gives a $5 bill to a 12-year-old girl, thinking she's helping. The girl then says they wanted $20 instead. The author takes back the $5, says they'll give a $20, but walks away. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but the author is unsure.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nLooking at the facts: The initial act was giving $5 out of kindness. The girl then changes her request to $20. The author's response is to reclaim the $5 and promise a $20, but then leaves without giving anything. The key here is whether the author was justified in taking back the $5. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, once the $5 is given, it belongs to the girl. If the girl then says they wanted $20, the author isn't obligated to give more. But the twist is that the author took back the $5. If the money was already given, taking it back might be problematic. Did the girl accept the $5, and then ask for more? If so, the author could argue they were generous and then realized the girl might have needed more. But by taking it back, the author ended up giving nothing. \n\nFrom a moral perspective, giving money to someone in need, even if it's a child, is an act of kindness. If the girl was genuinely in need, even if the author thought they weren't, giving $5 was a good deed. Then changing the request might be a test, but the author's response was to take back the money. That could be seen as dishonest, especially if the girl expected the $5 as real help. The author's action might be perceived as giving with the expectation that the recipient will be grateful, and then taking it back when the request was higher. \n\nAnother angle: The author might have thought the girls were not in real need (they were clean, not homeless), so maybe they were testing the author's generosity. But even if that's the case, the author's action of taking back the money could be seen as a stingy or dishonest move. It's like giving a gift and then taking it back because the recipient asked for more.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for taking back the $5 is that the girl wanted $20. But if the girl had already accepted the $5 and then asked for more, the author could have simply said they can't give more, not take back the $5. Taking back the money might be seen as giving it conditionally, which isn't ethical.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the author suspected the girls weren't in dire need, the act of giving and then retracting the money is inconsiderate and possibly deceptive. The girl might have expected the $5 as a genuine gesture, and the author's behavior could be perceived as a trick or a way to avoid giving more. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
