I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author did something wrong by taking back the $5 after the girl asked for $20. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author gave $5 to two girls, maybe 12 and 6. The girl then said they wanted $20. The author took back the $5 and left. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move. The author isn't sure. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are intent and context. The author initially gave $5 as a charitable act. Then, when the girl asked for more, the author took back the $5. Why would someone do that? Maybe they felt pressured, didn't want to give more, or thought it was a trick. But the situation is a bit ambiguous.\n\nThe girls' appearance is described as untidy but not homeless. That might suggest they weren't in serious need. But the author's action of taking the $5 back could be seen as dishonest. When you give money expecting it to be a final gesture, then retracting it could be seen as manipulative or deceitful. Especially if the author told the girl to return the $5 to get a $20. That might be an attempt to make the situation look better, but in reality, they didn't follow through.\n\nAlternatively, the author might have felt embarrassed or regretful after realizing the girls might not be in genuine need. Taking back the money could be a way to avoid giving more. However, the act of taking back the money after giving it might be considered rude or inconsiderate, regardless of their reasoning.\n\nAnother angle: when someone accepts a gift and then asks for more, the giver isn't obligated to give more. But in this case, the author gave the $5, then took it back. That's a reversal that could be seen as exploiting the situation. The girl might have felt pressured or tricked into returning the $5 for a higher amount, which the author didn't actually provide.\n\nAlso, the context of the girls' appearance being untidy but not homeless might lead others to think the author misjudged the situation. If the girls weren't in dire need, maybe the author gave out of impulse and then regretted it. But the act of taking back the money could come across as stingy or insincere.\n\nIn terms of social norms, once you give someone money as charity, it's generally expected to be a final action. Retracting it might be viewed as dishonest, especially if the giver made a promise (like giving $20) but didn't keep it. The author's action could be seen as a way to avoid giving more without facing scrutiny, but it's a bit underhanded.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's action of taking back the $5 after giving it and then not fulfilling the promise of a $20 donation seems like a bad move. It could be considered inconsiderate and dishonest. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
