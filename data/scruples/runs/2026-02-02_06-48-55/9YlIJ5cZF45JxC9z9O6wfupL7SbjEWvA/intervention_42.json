I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to two girls who asked for money. The older one then said they wanted $20 instead. The person took back the $5 and left. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move.\n\nFirst, why did the person give the $5 in the first place? Maybe they thought the girls were in need. But then when the older girl asked for more, the person changed their mind. But taking back the $5 might have been disrespectful. The kids might have been trying to get more money, maybe they were playing a prank or testing the person's generosity. The person's action could be seen as stingy or not trustworthy because they didn't follow through with the initial offer. \n\nAlso, the person mentions the girls weren't homeless or impoverished. So maybe the request wasn't genuine. But even if they were just asking for fun, the person's response could be hurtful. If someone offers money, taking it back might make the giver look unreliable. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that it's better to keep the commitment once you've made it, even if the request seems insincere. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the person was trying to correct their mistake. They gave $5 but realized the girls wanted more, so they tried to adjust. But taking back the money immediately after giving it might be confusing. Perhaps they should have just said they can't give $20 and offered to give $5 if that's okay. \n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone is asked for money, it's usually better to either give if you're willing or decline politely. Changing your mind and taking back the money after giving it could be seen as rude because it shows inconsistency. The author might have been trying to be helpful but ended up being inconsiderate. So, I think the author is in the wrong.\n"
