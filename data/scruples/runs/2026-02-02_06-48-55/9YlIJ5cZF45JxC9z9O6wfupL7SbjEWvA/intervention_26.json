I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to the girl, who then asked for $20. The author took back the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the initial act of giving $5 was likely a charitable gesture. If the girl then asked for $20, the author might have felt misled, so taking back the $5 could be seen as correcting the mistake. But maybe the girl just wanted more money and didn't realize the author only had $5. The author might have misinterpreted the situation. However, if the girl was genuine and just asked for more, the author's action could come off as stingy or not charitable. On the other hand, if the girl was trying to get more money by tricking the author into giving $5 first, then taking it back is justified. The description says the girls looked untidy but not homeless. Maybe they were just in need of money. The author's response could appear abrupt or not generous. The key is whether the author had an obligation to give more once the first amount was given. Since charity is voluntary, the author isn't obligated, but taking back the money might have been perceived as rude. So there's a balance between being charitable and being taken advantage of. The author's action might have been a mistake in handling the situation gracefully, hence in the wrong.\n"
