I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by taking back the money after giving it to the girls.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author gives $5 to two girls, probably thinking they need help. The older girl then says they wanted $20. The author takes back the $5 and leaves. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author is unsure.\n\nSo, the key points here. When you give someone money, it's a gift unless there's an agreement otherwise. Once given, the money is theirs. The author gave $5, then tried to take it back because the girl said they wanted more. But the author can't just take it back once it's given. That's like saying, \"I'll give you $5 now, but actually, I'll take it back because you asked for more.\" That's not how giving money works. \n\nAlso, the girls weren't clearly in desperate need. They were tidy, not homeless. The author might have thought they were helping, but then changed his mind when they asked for more. That's being inconsiderate. The girls expected the $5, and the author's action was a betrayal of their trust. \n\nEven if the author felt misled, the correct approach would be to not give money in the first place if there was uncertainty. Taking it back after the fact is wrong because the money has already been transferred. The author's action could be seen as using the girls to get back at them for asking for more, which isn't fair. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction makes sense. It's not just about the money but about respect and the social contract when someone asks for help. The author's move came off as manipulative and rude. So, the answer is A.\n"
