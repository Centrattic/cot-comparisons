I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back the $5 after giving it to the kids. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author was buying pizza and gave a $5 bill to a 12-year-old girl, thinking that was the amount they were offering. Then the girl asked for $20 instead, so the author took the $5 back and walked away. His girlfriend says it was a dick move. The kids didn't look homeless or in need, just maybe not dressed neatly but clean.\n\nSo, the main points here are about intent and the action taken. When the author gave the $5, he thought that was what the kids wanted. But when the girl asked for $20, he took back the $5. The question is whether this was wrong.\n\nI need to consider the perspective of both sides. From the author's side, he might have thought he was being generous, but after realizing the kids wanted more, he decided to take back the money. But wait, can you just take back money once you've given it? Legally, if someone gives money as a gift or donation, the recipient keeps it. So if the author gave the $5, he can't take it back. But in this case, the author took back the $5, which could be seen as taking back a gift, which might not be appropriate.\n\nFrom the kids' perspective, they might have been testing the author, or maybe they were in a situation where they needed money. But the author's girlfriend points out that they didn't look homeless. If they were just asking for money for a specific reason, maybe they had a legitimate need, but the author's action could be seen as mocking them or not taking their request seriously.\n\nAnother angle: when the author gave the $5, he might have thought it was acceptable, but upon realizing the kids wanted more, he took it back. This could be perceived as a stingy or deceptive move. The children might have been genuinely trying to get money, and the author's action could be seen as a joke or a way to avoid giving more, which could be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author's comment about the kids not being in dire straits might imply that he didn't think they were in real need, which could justify his decision. But then again, giving money to someone in need isn't mandatory, but taking it back after giving could be seen as a breach of trust or a mean gesture.\n\nIn terms of social norms, once you give money, even if it's a charity or to someone in need, taking it back can be considered rude. The author's action might have been a way to avoid giving more, but the way he did it by taking back the $5 he already gave might come off as insincere or disrespectful.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's action could be seen as wrong because he gave money and then took it back, which might have been hurtful to the children, even if they weren't in extreme poverty. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that it was a dick move, and society often frowns upon taking back donations or gifts once they're given, even if the donor changes their mind.\n"
