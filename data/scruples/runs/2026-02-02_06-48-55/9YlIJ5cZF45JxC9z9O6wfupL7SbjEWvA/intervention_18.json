I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves giving $5 to a girl and her sister, then realizing the girl wanted $20. The author takes back the $5 and gives nothing instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations here. The initial act of giving $5 was a kindness. The girl then asks for $20, which might indicate that they were planning to ask for more. The author's response was to take back the $5 and leave, which the girlfriend called a \"dick move.\"\n\nNow, the author's reasoning is that the girls weren't in dire need (untidy but not homeless), so maybe the request was a scam. But the author's action of taking back the money could be seen as dishonest. When you give a donation, even if it's a small amount, it's expected to be given freely. If the person later takes it back under the pretense of fulfilling a higher request, that's not just a mistake\u2014it's a breach of trust. \n\nThe key point here is the initial act of giving. By offering $5 without knowing the girl wanted $20, the author committed to that amount. Changing the terms after the fact, especially by taking back the money, could be viewed as unethical. Even if the author suspects the girls were trying to get more money, the appropriate response would be to not give at all initially, rather than retracting after the fact.\n\nAdditionally, the author's action might have left the younger sister confused or upset. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the move was unkind. While the author might not have been in the wrong in a legal sense, morally, it's a gray area. The act of taking back the money after a donation can be seen as using the initial goodwill to then exploit the situation, which is ethically questionable.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't follow through on their initial generous act and instead acted on a change of heart in a way that could be seen as deceptive.\n"
