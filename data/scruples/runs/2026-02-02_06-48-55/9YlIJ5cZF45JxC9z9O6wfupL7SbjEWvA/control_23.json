I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back the $5 after the girls asked for $20 instead of the initial $5 they were given. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author gives a $5 bill to two girls, thinking it's a small donation. Then the older girl says they actually wanted $20. The author takes back the $5 and walks away. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move.\n\nSo, the key points here. Did the author have an obligation to give the $20? When someone asks for money, especially in a public place, it's typically a request, not a contract. The author gave $5 on a whim, but the girl then changes the amount. The author isn't legally bound to give more, right? So technically, he's within his rights to take back the $5 if he's not willing to give the higher amount. \n\nBut maybe the issue is about social expectations. If you give a small amount, but the person asks for more, is it rude to take it back? Some might see it as being stingy or not being honest if you didn't intend to give more in the first place. However, the author might have thought he was being generous with $5, but the girls wanted more. So taking back the $5 could be seen as a way to not be taken advantage of. \n\nThe girls' appearance is mentioned as not being impoverished. That might make some people question if they genuinely needed the money, but that's speculative. The author isn't sure if they were homeless. So maybe the author's judgment was based on their appearance, which isn't a good indicator of someone's circumstances. \n\nAlso, the act of giving money is a voluntary gesture. If the author changed his mind after realizing the request was for more, he can take back the money. But the way he did it\u2014taking the $5 back and walking away\u2014might come off as abrupt or dismissive. The girlfriend's reaction is that it was a dick move, possibly because it felt like the author was mocking them or not being sincere.\n\nAnother angle: when the girl asked for $20, the author could have said he can't give more and left it at that. Instead, he took back the $5, which might have left the girls with nothing. That could be seen as inconsiderate. But on the other hand, the author isn't obligated to give more than he's willing to. \n\nIs there a cultural context here? In some cultures, giving and taking back might be more accepted, in others, it could be seen as rude. The key is whether the action was malicious. The author didn't seem to have ill intent, just a change of heart. But the way he executed it might have been poor in social grace.\n\nSo, legally and morally, the author isn't in the wrong because he's allowed to change his mind. But socially, it's a bit iffy because it could be seen as a breach of goodwill. The answer hinges on whether the question is legal/ethical or social. Since the question is about being in the wrong, it's likely referring to social norms. In that case, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because the action was perceived as rude. However, others might argue B (not in the wrong) because he wasn't obligated to give more. \n\nBut considering the common advice in such situations, people often say not to give money to homeless or panhandlers because it's a trap. However, this was a child, which complicates it. If the girl was a child, even if she's manipulating, the adult's responsibility is to not engage in such a way. So taking back the money might be a way to avoid being taken advantage of, but the method could be better. \n\nAlternatively, the problem is that the author gave money with the intention of a donation, then changed his mind. Once given, the money is theirs. Taking it back could be seen as inconsiderate. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm a bit conflicted because there's no legal wrong, but social norms vary.\n"
