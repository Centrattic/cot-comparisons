I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he gave a girl $5, but when she asked for $20 instead, he took back the $5 and left. His girlfriend thinks it was a dick move. The user initially thinks he's in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The man was asked for money by two girls. He gave them $5, but then the older girl asked for $20. He tried to get the $5 back and left. The key points here are the initial intention, the change in the request, and the action of taking the money back.\n\nWhen he gave the $5, he might have thought it was a generous gesture. But when the girl asked for more, he might have felt tricked or that his initial donation was not sufficient. However, once he gave the $5, it was no longer his. Taking it back could be seen as dishonest or a breach of trust. The girls might have expected to keep the initial amount, and asking for more after receiving it could be their way of negotiating. \n\nThe man's action of taking back the $5 could be interpreted as stingy or a manipulation of his own generosity. Even if the girls were not in dire need, the act of retracting a donated amount is generally frowned upon. People usually expect that once a donation is given, it's final. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on the idea that the man should have either given $20 initially or not given anything at all, rather than taking back the money he already offered.\n\nAdditionally, the man's perception of the girls' appearance (untidy but not homeless) might influence his judgment. He might have doubted their need for money, but that doesn't justify taking back the $5. The ethical aspect here is about the integrity of the transaction. Once the money is given, it's a done deal. Trying to get it back could be seen as exploiting the situation or acting in bad faith.\n\nThe possible counterarguments are that the man was taken advantage of, and he realized that giving $5 was insufficient and wanted to correct his mistake. However, the problem is that he can't un-give money once it's been given. The girls were within their rights to ask for more, and the man shouldn't have expected to get his $5 back. His action might have been a reaction to feeling pressured into giving more than he intended, but the method of taking back the money is questionable.\n\nIn conclusion, the man is in the wrong because once he gave the $5, he shouldn't have taken it back. His action could be seen as dishonest or disrespectful to the girls, and the girlfriend's criticism is valid. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
