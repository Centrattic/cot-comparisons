I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for taking back the $5 he gave to a kid when she asked for $20 instead. The situation is that he initially gave $5 to a girl who asked for money, but then she wanted $20. He asked for the $5 back and took it, which his girlfriend criticized as a dick move.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author gave $5 first, and then the girl changed her mind and wanted more. If he took the $5 back without her consent, that's a problem. Because once you give someone money, unless they agree to return it, it's theirs. So taking it back without permission could be seen as theft. Even if she asked for more, he can't forcibly take the first amount back. He could have said \"I can only give $5\" and left it at that, but taking it back might be wrong.\n\nAlso, the kids looked \"untidy\" but not homeless. So maybe there's a judgment based on their appearance. People might be more inclined to help those in need, but if they're just asking for more money, it's a different story. However, the key issue is the act of taking the money back. If you give it, it's theirs. You can't just reclaim it because you changed your mind later. So the author's action could be considered inconsiderate or even theft. His girlfriend's reaction might be valid because he took the money back without asking, which is disrespectful. \n\nBut some might argue that he was justified in retracting his offer if he realized he could give more. However, the correct approach would be to state the amount he's willing to give upfront. So the answer is likely A, yes, he's in the wrong because he took the money back without the girl's consent, which could be seen as dishonest or unfair.\n"
