I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person gave $5 to two girls who asked for money, and then when they asked for $20 instead, he took the $5 back and left. The main question is whether he was wrong to do that.\n\nFirst, when someone asks for money and you give them a smaller amount, you shouldn't assume they'll accept it. If they change their mind, it's not uncommon to retract the offer. But here, the girl initially took the $5 and then asked for $20. The author then tried to take the $5 back, which might be where the issue is. The problem could be that once the $5 was given, even if the girl changed her request, the author can't just take it back once it's in their hand. That's a bit awkward because the money is already transferred. Maybe the author should have given the $20 instead of taking back the $5. But if the girl was trying to scam him by upping the amount after receiving the $5, that complicates things. However, the author mentions the girls looked clean but not homeless, so maybe they weren't in dire need. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from the fact that taking back money after giving it could be seen as stingy or not charitable. But the author's action was to correct the mistake in the amount given. The key points are intent and the social expectation when giving money. If the girl genuinely needed $20, taking back the $5 could be a problem. But if the girl was just trying to get more, the author's move was justified. However, in social interactions, once you give money, retracting it might be seen as rude. So the author might be in the wrong because he didn't follow through on the initial generous act by giving the correct amount instead of rescinding his donation.\n"
