I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to a child and then taking it back when the child asks for more.\n\nFirst, the author gave $5 to a girl, but then the girl asked for $20. The author took back the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author isn't sure. The girls were described as not homeless or impoverished but just untidy, like no shoes but clean.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial act of giving money and then retracting it. When someone asks for money, especially if you're in a position to help, giving it with the expectation that they might ask for more later could be a problem. But in this case, the author gave $5 and then when asked for $20, took back the $5. \n\nI think the issue is whether the author's action was deceptive. The author gave money with the intention of helping, then took it back because they weren't willing to give more. The problem is that once the money is given, taking it back might be seen as dishonest or disrespectful. Even if the girls weren't in desperate need, the act of taking back the money could be hurtful. \n\nAlso, the girl's age is a factor here. A 12-year-old might not be in a position to ask for money like that, possibly without adult supervision. The author might have been taken advantage of, but taking back the money could still be seen as abrupt or not compassionate. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is that it was a dick move, which suggests that social norms expect giving money once and not retracting it. The author's reasoning might be that they were being taken advantage of, but the way they handled it was not tactful. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because once they gave the $5, taking it back could be seen as a lack of generosity and possibly rude. Even if the girls were trying to get more, the author's response wasn't kind. Maybe a better approach would be to say they can't give more without taking back the original amount. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
