I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that he gave the girls $5, then they asked for $20, so he took back the $5 and walked away. His girlfriend says it was a dick move. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author gave $5 initially, maybe out of good will. The girls then asked for $20. Why would they do that? Maybe they were testing him or had higher needs. But the author then took back the $5 and left. \n\nWhat's the ethical angle here? When you give someone money as a donation or a gift, the expectation is that they can keep it. If the person then asks for more, the initial giver isn't obligated to give more. But taking back the original $5 seems like a step back. Maybe the author felt tricked, but the girls might just want more help. \n\nAlso, the description says they weren't impoverished or homeless. So maybe they were scamming him. But even if they were, the author's response might be seen as rude. If you give money, taking it back after the fact could be seen as inconsiderate. The girls might have been honest in their need, and the author's reaction could come off as stingy or manipulative. \n\nThe author's action was to take back the $5 and leave. That could be seen as treating the girls as if they were deceptive, even if they weren't. It's a bit of a judgment call. On one hand, he's not obligated to give more. On the other hand, retracting a gift after the fact might be rude. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is mentioned, so maybe she sees it as a breach of trust. The user is conflicted too. The author's reasoning might be that he didn't want to give more, but taking back the initial amount could be seen as dishonest. \n\nIn terms of social norms, giving a gift and then taking it back is generally frowned upon. Even if the person is in the right to not give more, taking back the first donation is a different story. So, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because taking back the money after giving it could be considered rude or dishonest, especially if the request for $20 was genuine. Alternatively, if the girls were trying to scam, the author isn't wrong, but since the situation isn't clear, it's safer to say he's in the wrong for the way he handled it.\n"
