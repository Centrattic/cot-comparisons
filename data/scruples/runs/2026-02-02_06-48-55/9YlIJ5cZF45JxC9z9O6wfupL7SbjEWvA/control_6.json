I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to two girls and then taking it back when they asked for more. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The person gives $5 to a 12-year-old girl and a younger sister. The girl then asks for $20 instead. The person takes back the $5 and leaves. The girlfriend says it's a dick move, but the person is unsure.\n\nSo, the key points here are intent, the action taken, and societal norms. When someone offers money out of goodwill, expecting it to be used for their need. If the recipient then changes their request, maybe the person felt misled. But was there any indication of deception?\n\nThe writer mentions the girls looked untidy but not homeless. That might mean they're in a difficult situation but not clearly in need. However, the act of taking back the money after giving it could be seen as stingy or not following through on a generous act. \n\nBut wait, when the person gave the $5, was there any agreement? The initial request was for money, the person gave $5, and then the girl asked for more. The person then took back the $5 to give $20 instead. However, once the money is given, it's no longer theirs. If they took it back, maybe that's problematic. Unless the person said they would give $20 if the girls asked, but that's not clear here.\n\nIn the story, the person says, \"give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.\" So they offered a trade. The girl might have thought they were getting $5, then realized they wanted more. But the person took back the $5 before giving the $20. Was that a trick? Maybe the girl expected the $5 and then an additional $15, but the person is just taking back the $5 and leaving. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if the person gave $5 in good faith and then took it back because the request changed, that could be seen as not being genuine. If the person didn't want to give $20, maybe they shouldn't have given anything. Or if they didn't want to give $20, they could have said they couldn't. But taking back the $5 after giving it might be considered dishonest or manipulative. \n\nOn the other hand, the person might have felt the girls were testing them, asking for more after getting the initial amount. But the girls could have been in a real situation, and the person's action came off as not helping. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that society might view the person negatively for this.\n\nSo, the person's action of taking back the money might be seen as inconsiderate or not following through on a generous act. Even if the person thought the girls were trying to get more, the act of repossessing the money after giving it could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the answer might be A, the person is in the wrong.\n"
