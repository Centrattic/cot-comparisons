I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person went to get pizza, and on the way back, two girls approached them for money. They initially gave $5, but the older girl asked for $20 instead. The person then took back the $5 and left. Now they're wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The person gave $5, which was a generous gesture, but the girl changed her mind. Is it reasonable to expect that you can't take back a donation once given? But then again, maybe the girl was just testing or trying to get more. \n\nThe person might have thought that once they gave the $5, the girl's request for $20 was a new ask. They had the right to say they wouldn't give more. However, taking the $5 back might have been seen as rude because the person had already given it. Maybe they should have just said no to the $20 without taking the money back. \n\nAlso, the description mentions the girls weren't homeless or in poor condition. That could suggest that the request was a scam or just for pocket money. If the person felt they were being taken advantage of, then taking it back makes sense. But maybe they could have handled it more politely, like just saying \"No\" instead of reversing the transaction. \n\nThe girlfriend says it was a dick move. That's a common reaction because taking back a gift can feel like a slap in the face. But the person might argue they had the right to reconsider. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the key points are: Did the person have the right to take back the money? Probably yes, but the way they did it might have been considered rude. However, since the girl changed her mind about the amount, the person wasn't obligated to give more. The answer might depend on cultural norms. In some cases, once you give something, you can't take it back. But if the recipient is changing the terms, maybe it's different. \n\nSo, maybe the person isn't in the wrong because they're allowed to change their mind, but they could have handled it better. The answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
