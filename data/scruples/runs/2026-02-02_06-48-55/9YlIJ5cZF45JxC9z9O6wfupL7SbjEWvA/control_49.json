I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who posted this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to two girls, changing their mind, and taking the money back.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation step by step. The person gave $5 to the older girl, but then the younger one said they wanted $20 instead. The person took the $5 back and left. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nLet me break it down. The initial act of giving $5 was generous. But then when the child says they need $20, the person takes back the $5. The key here is the intent and the action. The person might have felt misled when the child changed the request, but is that a valid reason to retract the donation?\n\nIn charitable giving, once the money is given, it's a completed act. However, the person hadn't given the $5 yet when the child said they needed more. The person offered to give $5, then upon hearing $20, took it back. The problem is that the person might have felt the children were being greedy, but children, especially younger ones, might not understand the implications of their requests. The mother or guardian isn't present, so the person is dealing with minors.\n\nIs it wrong to take back the money? If the person gave the $5 first, then took it back because the child increased the request, maybe the person is in the wrong because once the money is given, you can't just take it back unless there's deception. But in this case, the money wasn't given yet. The person gave $5, then when the child said they wanted $20, they took the $5 back. The person might have felt the children were trying to get more money, but taking back the $5 could come across as cruel or inconsiderate, especially since the children were not homeless or in obvious distress.\n\nThe person's reasoning is that the girls looked clean and not in need. But the initial request was for money, and the person chose to help. Changing their mind after the fact could be seen as stingy or not following through on a charitable act. Even if the person thought the children were not in genuine need, once they started to help, retracting the offer might not be the right move. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the person's actions were rude.\n\nSo considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they took back the money after giving it once, which could be seen as disrespectful or unkind, especially when dealing with children. The children might not have the understanding to know they could be asking for more, and the person's response was abrupt. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
