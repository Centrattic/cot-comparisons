I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to a girl who asked for money, then when the girl asked for $20 instead, they took back the $5 and left. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, the initial act of giving $5 was a charitable gesture. The girl then changed her request to $20. The author took back the $5, which could be seen as rescinding the original donation. But maybe they felt misled because the girl asked for more after receiving the initial amount. \n\nHowever, when you give money to someone, you can't necessarily expect them to stick to a specific amount. The girl might have thought that $5 wasn't enough, so she asked for more. The author's decision to take back the money and not give the $20 could come off as stingy or not following through on a commitment. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have intended to give $20 and realized they made a mistake. But taking back the $5 after already handing it over might be seen as inconsiderate. People might expect that once you give money, even if the situation changes, you don't take it back. \n\nAlso, considering the girls' appearance wasn't dire, the author might have doubts about their need, but that's not necessarily a reason to retract the donation. The key issue is the act of taking back the money after giving it, which could be perceived as rude or unkind. \n\nSo, weighing these points, the author might be in the wrong because once a donation is given, retracting it can be seen as not respecting the initial gesture. The girl's follow-up request could be unexpected, but taking back the money might be the questionable part.\n"
