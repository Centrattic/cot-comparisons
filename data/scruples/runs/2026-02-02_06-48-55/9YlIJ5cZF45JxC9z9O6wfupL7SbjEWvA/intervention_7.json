I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to a girl who asked for money, but then the girl said they actually wanted $20. The person took back the $5 and walked away. The question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the initial act of giving $5 is a kind gesture, which is good. But when the girl changes the request to $20, the person's response is to take back the $5. The key point here is whether the person had any obligation to give the additional $15. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the person isn't obligated to give any money in the first place. They chose to give $5 out of generosity. When the girl asks for more, the person can choose to give more or not. Taking back the $5 might be seen as a bit of a stingy move because they gave with the expectation of a small donation. However, the person isn't being cruel; they just didn't want to give more than they intended. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is that it was a dick move, but maybe she's thinking about the children's situation. The girls were described as not impoverished. So, perhaps they were just asking for more money than the person was comfortable giving. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the person isn't breaking any laws. They aren't in the wrong legally, but morally, it's a gray area. The act of giving and then retracting might be perceived as unkind, but since they didn't have to give anything in the first place, it's a matter of personal choice. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they had the right to change their mind when asked for more. However, some might argue that retracting the money after giving it shows a lack of generosity. But since the person isn't obligated, it's a judgment call.\n"
