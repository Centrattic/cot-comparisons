I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves giving $5 to a girl and her sister, then taking it back when they ask for $20 instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial act of giving money. The person gave $5 voluntarily, which is a kind gesture. Then, when the girl asks for $20, the author takes back the $5. The key points here are consent and intent. The author gave the $5 on the condition that it was a spare, and when the request changed, they retracted the offer. \n\nThe girl's request for $20 wasn't there initially, so the author might not be obligated to give more. However, taking back the $5 after it was already given could be seen as dishonest or disrespectful, especially if the girl felt they were being taken advantage of. \n\nThe girlfriend's opinion is that it was a dick move. The user is unsure. The author's reasoning is that the girls didn't seem homeless, so maybe the author thought they were scamming. But taking the money back after giving it might still be wrong because the initial offer was made in good faith. \n\nLegally, once money is given, it's theirs. Reclaiming it could be seen as theft or fraud. Ethically, it depends on the intent. If the author realized they were being scammed and retracted the offer, that's different, but if they just changed their mind, that's another issue. \n\nThe author's actions might be inconsiderate, but maybe they were protecting themselves from being scammed. However, retracting a gift after it's given is generally frowned upon unless there's a valid reason. Since the girls didn't seem desperate, maybe the author overreacted. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (wrong) because taking back the money after giving it is dishonest. But if the author had a legitimate reason to suspect a scam, it might be B (not wrong). The scenario doesn't clearly state that the girls were scamming, just that they looked untidy but not homeless. The author's assumption might be unfounded. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for taking back the money without a valid reason.\n"
