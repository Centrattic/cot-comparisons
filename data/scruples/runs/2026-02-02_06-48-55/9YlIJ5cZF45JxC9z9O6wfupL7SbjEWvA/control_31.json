I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. So the situation is, the author gave a little girl $5, and then when the girl asked for $20 instead, he took the $5 back and walked away. The girlfriend thinks he was a dick, but he's unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The kids approached him for money. He gave them $5, but then when they asked for $20, he took the $5 back. The author might be trying to get a larger donation by acting like they need more. But maybe the author felt tricked because they changed their request after getting the $5. \n\nThe key points are: Did the author act inappropriately by taking back the money? When you give money to someone who asks, there's an expectation that it's a donation, not a transaction. So if the kids asked for $20 after receiving $5, maybe the author felt they were exploiting his generosity. However, taking the money back after it's given could be seen as rude because the initial $5 was a donation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have thought he was being taken advantage of. But once the money is given, it's theirs. Taking it back could be considered inconsiderate. The girls' appearance is mentioned as not impoverished, so maybe the author doubted their need. But that's a judgment call. \n\nIs it wrong to take back money after giving it? If the author gave it with the intention of helping and then realized they wanted more, taking it back is a reversal of that act. That's where the \"AITA\" part comes in. The girlfriend says it was a dick move because maybe he should have just said he can't give $20 instead of taking back the $5. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because once you give money, you can't take it back. Even if he felt tricked, the better approach would be to decline further help without taking back the initial donation. Taking it back shows a lack of trust and is possibly mean-spirited. So the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
