I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves giving a little girl $5, then taking it back when she asks for $20. The author argues that the kids didn't look homeless, so maybe they were just scamming. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move.\n\nFirst, I need to consider intentions. The author gave $5 out of kindness, thinking it was a genuine need. But when the kid asked for $20, maybe they realized it was a setup, like a sibling acting as a distraction. Taking back the $5 could be seen as a way to avoid being taken advantage of. However, taking money back after giving it could be seen as dishonest or rude. \n\nOn the other hand, if the kids were trying to scam, the author was protecting themselves. But the kids might not have been scamming; maybe they just wanted more. The key points are intent, the appearance of the kids (not obviously homeless), and social norms about giving money. \n\nIf the author thought they were being scammed, it's understandable to retract the money. But others might say that once you give money, you can't just take it back, especially to kids. The author might have handled it differently, like ignoring the request for $20 and just walking away. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's action could be seen as self-preservation, but it might come off as rude. The answer depends on whether the scam was real. Since the kids didn't look homeless, maybe the author was right to be cautious. But taking back the money after giving it might still be wrong. Hmm. I think the answer is A (wrong) because once you give money, retracting it can be seen as dishonest, regardless of the reason. But others might argue B (not wrong) if they think the kids were scammers.\n"
