I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the situation is the author gave a kid $5, then the kid asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and left, and now the girlfriend says it was a dick move. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author initially gave $5 to the girl, probably in good faith. But then the girl, maybe with her sister, asked for $20. The author tried to take back the $5 and gave them $20, but the key point is that the author took the $5 back. The problem is that taking back the $5 after giving it might be seen as a bit of a trick. \n\nWait, the author says they gave $5, then the girl asked for $20. The author told her to give back the $5 and get a $20. But the author then took the $5 and walked away. Did the author actually give the $20? The story says they took the $5 back and walked away. So the author didn't actually give the $20, right? So the author gave $5, then took it back and didn't give the $20. That sounds like the author was trying to get rid of the girls by taking back the initial $5 and not following through. \n\nThe girlfriend thinks it's a dick move because maybe the author was being condescending or not generous. The author might have thought the girls were trying to scam them, but the girls looked untidy but not homeless. The author's action of taking the $5 back could be seen as mocking or treating the girls disrespectfully. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the girls were trying to get more money after the initial $5, so they tried to end the interaction by taking back the $5. But the problem is that the author didn't actually give the $20, so they left the girls with nothing. That could be seen as being inconsiderate because the author gave money initially but then took it away, which might have been confusing or hurtful to the kids. \n\nAlso, the girls might have been in a situation where they needed the money. Even if they weren't homeless, asking for money can be a sensitive issue. The author's action might have been impulsive, not thinking about the kids' perspective. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't follow through with the $20 and took back the $5 in a way that could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. The girlfriend's reaction makes sense. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
