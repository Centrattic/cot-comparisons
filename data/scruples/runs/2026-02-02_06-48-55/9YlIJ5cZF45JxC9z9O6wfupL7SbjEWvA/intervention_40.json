I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to a kid, then taking it back.\n\nFirst, the person gives $5 to a girl and her younger sister, but the older one asks for $20 instead. So the author takes back the $5 and leaves. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the user isn't sure. \n\nHmm, what's the key here? The initial act of giving money is charitable. But when the girl asks for more, the author might feel pressured. But taking back the $5 could be seen as deceptive. Did the author have a reason to believe the girls were in need? The description mentions they looked untidy but not homeless. \n\nSo, the author gave $5, then when asked for more, took it back. That might come off as insincere. The girl might have thought they were getting $20, but the author just took the $5 back without giving anything else. It's a bit of a bait and switch. \n\nBut the user also points out the girls didn't look impoverished. Maybe they were just asking for money for something else. The author's action could be seen as taking advantage of their request. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt tricked after giving $5 and then being asked for more. But taking back the money might not be the right move. Instead, if they didn't want to give more, they could have refused politely. \n\nI think the key here is the act of taking back the money after giving it. It could be seen as inconsiderate or rude. So the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
