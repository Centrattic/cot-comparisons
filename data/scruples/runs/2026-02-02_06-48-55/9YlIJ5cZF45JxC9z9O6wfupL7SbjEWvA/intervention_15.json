I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author did something wrong here. So, the situation is that the author was buying pizza and gave some money to a little girl and her sister. Initially, he gave $5, but the older girl asked for $20 instead. He took back the $5 and walked away, and now his girlfriend is upset with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author gave $5 as a donation, which the older girl then changed her mind about. But when he tried to correct that, he took the $5 back and left. The question is whether that was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought that the girl was trying to scam him. He gave $5, then when she asked for $20, he realized maybe they were asking for more than they needed. But by taking back the $5, he might have been trying to avoid giving more than he wanted to. However, is it ethical to take back the money once it's given, especially if the recipient decided they wanted more?\n\nIn some cultures, once you give money, it's considered a gift and can't be taken back. But in this case, the girl changed her mind after receiving the $5. The author's action of taking the money back could be seen as dishonest because he took it from a child, which is a vulnerable person. Even if the girl was being pushy, the author's response was to take back the money, which might not be the right approach. Instead, he could have just walked away without giving anything in the first place.\n\nAlso, the author's girlfriend is upset, which suggests that maybe there's a social expectation that he shouldn't have taken the money back. The girls weren't in obvious need, so maybe the author's initial donation was unnecessary, and by taking back the $5, he was being inconsiderate. \n\nAnother angle: the author might have felt tricked, but using a child to ask for money could be a tactic. However, taking the money back from a child isn't a good approach. The better response would be to say no, not to engage in the back-and-forth. The author's action of taking the $5 back could be seen as taking advantage of the children's position, even if the children might be trying to manipulate him.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably in the wrong because taking the money back from a child is not ethical and could be seen as rude or dishonest. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
