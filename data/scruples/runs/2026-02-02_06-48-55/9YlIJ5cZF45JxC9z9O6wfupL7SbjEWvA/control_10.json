I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about giving a child $5 and then taking it back when the child asks for $20. The writer took the $5 back, and their girlfriend thinks it was a dick move. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person gave $5 to a girl who asked for money, then the girl changed her mind and asked for $20. The writer then took back the $5 and left. The kids looked untidy but not homeless. \n\nSo, the key points here are: initial act of giving $5, the change in request to $20, and the reaction of taking back the $5. The writer might argue that they were being manipulated or that the request was a scam. On the other hand, the girl's request change could be seen as taking advantage of someone's kindness. \n\nLegally, there's no obligation to give money, and the writer isn't in the wrong for changing their mind. However, morally, it's a bit more complex. Giving to a child, even if they're not in dire need, is often seen as a good deed. The writer's action of taking back the money might be perceived as rude or untrustworthy, especially if the girl was trying to get more than initially asked. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that she felt the person was abrupt or unkind. The writer's intention might have been to not be taken advantage of, but the method could be seen as hurtful. The children's appearance\u2014untidy but not homeless\u2014adds another layer. It's possible the girl was just trying to get more money, but the writer's reaction might not have considered the child's perspective adequately. \n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone offers money, retracting it after it's given might be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the initial request was a tactic to get more, the writer might feel justified. But the way it's done matters. Walking away without explanation could be seen as dismissive. \n\nI think the main issue here is the abruptness and the lack of empathy. The writer didn't explain their actions, which could have led to confusion or hurt feelings for the children. Even if the request was for more money, taking back the $5 might not be the kindest response. The correct approach might have been to politely decline the new request without retracting the initial gift. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they took back the money in a way that could be seen as rude, even if their intention was to not overspend. The action might have been a dick move as the girlfriend suggested.\n"
