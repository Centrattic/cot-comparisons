I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about giving $5 to a girl and her sister who asked for money, but then when they asked for $20, the author took the $5 back instead of giving more.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author gives $5 to the kids, then the older girl asks for $20 instead. The author then takes back the $5 and gives a $20 bill. The key points here are the initial action of giving money, the follow-up request for more, and the author's decision to retrieve the $5.\n\nThe girlfriend says it was a dick move. The author is unsure. The kids looked untidy but not homeless. So, the author's perspective is that maybe they were being taken advantage of by the older girl, who first asked for $5 and then upped the request. The author took the $5 back and gave $20 instead, possibly thinking that the initial $5 was too little and they wanted to correct that, or maybe they realized the mistake in giving $5 first.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, I should consider intent and context. If the author gave $5 with the intention to be generous, and then upon realizing the higher amount was needed, decided to give $20 instead of $5, maybe they thought it was better to give a more substantial amount. However, the act of taking back the $5 might be seen as deceptive or manipulative if the author first gave $5 to get the $20. Alternatively, maybe they just wanted to correct their mistake and give the right amount.\n\nThe kids' appearance: they're not homeless but just untidy. That might suggest they're not in an emergency situation. The older girl's behavior could be a bit of a ploy. The author might have felt they were being used and adjusted their donation. But is it wrong to take back the $5 once the request changes? \n\nIn some cases, people might expect that if you give a certain amount, you can't take it back. If the girl asked for $20 after initially being given $5, maybe the author should have given $15 more instead of taking back the $5. However, there's no indication that the author made a commitment to give $5. Donations are typically voluntary, and if the children changed their request, the author isn't obligated to comply. \n\nBut taking back the $5 could be seen as a way to get out of a larger donation. If the author had given $5, then the girl asked for $20, and the author was willing to give $20, maybe the right thing to do is just give the $15 difference. However, the author took back the $5 and gave $20 in place of the $5. The problem here is that the $5 was already given, and taking it back might imply that the author was trying to get a better deal or manipulate the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have realized they were being asked for more and wanted to correct their initial offer. If the children were genuine in their need, maybe the author's action was stingy or not following through on a commitment. But if they sensed the children were just asking for more than they initially wanted, the author's action was protective of their own money. \n\nThe concept of \"AITA\" usually revolves around whether the action was rude, inconsiderate, or wrong. The author's action of taking back the $5 could be seen as dishonest because they gave the $5 first, then when asked for more, they took it back to give a larger amount. The children might have expected the author to give $5 and that's it. Alternatively, if the author didn't want to give $5 and realized their mistake upon being asked for $20, then taking it back is a way to correct an error. \n\nBut in general, when someone gives money, they don't usually expect to take it back. The author might have been trying to be generous but was taken aback by the increased request. However, taking back the $5 could be interpreted as a trick, which is why the girlfriend is upset. \n\nSo, the answer depends on the intent. If the author gave $5 with the intention of it being a donation and then took it back to give a different amount, that's a bit of a problem. If they realized they shouldn't have given $5 and the $20 was a mistake, then maybe not. However, the way it's written, the author took the $5 back after giving it, which could be seen as a bit of a snub or not being genuine. \n\nIn many cases, people might think it's okay to adjust how they distribute their money if they feel the initial amount is not appropriate. But taking it back after giving could be seen as awkward or a bit of a move to avoid the initial small donation. The author might be in the wrong if they gave the $5 and then tried to retract it, especially if the children were in need. However, if there was a misunderstanding and the children were actually not in need but just wanted more, maybe not. \n\nBut the key is that the author took the $5 back. If they had just given $20 from the start, there wouldn't be an issue. By taking back the $5, it might look like they were trying to get out of giving the $5, which could be considered inconsiderate. However, if the author's intention was to correct their mistake, maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nIn the end, the author's action might be seen as a bit of a jerk move because they gave money and then took it back. Even if they had a reason, the action could be perceived as stingy or dishonest. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
