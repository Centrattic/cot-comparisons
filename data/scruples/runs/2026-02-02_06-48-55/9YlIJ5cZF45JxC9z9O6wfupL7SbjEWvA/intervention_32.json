I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking back the money after giving $5 to two kids asking for $20. The situation is that the author gave $5 but then the girl asked for $20, so he took back the $5 and tried to give $20 instead. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move. The girls weren't homeless or impoverished, just looked untidy but clean.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. When someone asks for money, especially children, and you give them a smaller amount than requested, maybe expecting them to take it, but then they want the higher amount. Then the person steps back, takes the money back, and offers more. But the key is whether the initial $5 was a donation that couldn't be taken back once given.\n\nWait, the author says he gave $5, then the girl said they wanted $20. So he said he'd take back the $5 and give $20. So he didn't actually give $20 in the end. Wait, the situation is that he took the $5 back and walked away. So he didn't follow through on the $20. The story is that he gave $5, then took it back. So he ended up not giving them anything. \n\nSo the user is asking if he's wrong for taking back the $5 after giving it. The author's reasoning was that since they asked for $20, he was willing to give more. But once he gave the $5, maybe the kids expected it, but he changed his mind. The problem is that the author gave the $5, then took it back. That might come off as stingy or disrespectful. Even if the kids were not in dire need, taking back the money could be seen as a betrayal of trust. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author thought he should give $20 if he was going to give anything, so giving $5 wasn't enough. But once he gave the $5, he realized his mistake and tried to correct it. However, the act of taking the money back might have been hurtful. The kids might have been embarrassed or felt disrespected. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move because taking back the money after giving it could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nAnother angle: when you give money to someone in need, you can't take it back. Once it's given, it's theirs. So taking it back could be unethical. The author might have felt that $5 wasn't enough, so he tried to retract it, but that's not the right approach. Instead, he should have said he could give $20 from the start. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he took back the money after giving it, which is disrespectful. Therefore, answer A.\n"
