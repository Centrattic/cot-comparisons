I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by taking back the money they gave to a kid. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo the author was buying pizza, got approached by two girls. They first asked for money, and he gave them $5. Then the older one said they wanted $20, so he took back the $5 and gave them $20. But his girlfriend thinks it's a dick move. The users think the author is wrong but want to know my opinion.\n\nHmm. The key points here are intent and how the situation was handled. The author initially gave $5, which was an act of generosity. Then the girl changed the request to $20. The author's reaction was to take back the $5 and give the $20. But wait, that's a bit tricky because once you give someone money, you can't just take it back unless they agree. So maybe the problem is that the author tried to reclaim the $5 after already giving it, which could be seen as dishonest.\n\nAlso, the age of the kids matters. The older one is 12, so she's a minor. If there was some sort of negotiation or agreement, but the author changed his mind, that could be problematic. The author's actions might be seen as taking advantage of the situation, especially if the kids didn't agree to return the $5. \n\nAnother angle: giving money to someone who asks for it. If the author gave $5, and then later decided to take it back under the pretense of giving $20, that might not be fair. Perhaps the author could have just given the $20 instead of trying to reclaim the $5. The way he \"took back\" the $5 could be seen as a bit of a trick, especially if the kids were confused or didn't know they could refuse.\n\nAlso, the author's note that the kids weren't homeless or impoverished. Maybe he felt they didn't need the money, but that's his assumption. Even if they didn't need it, giving money is a personal choice. Reversing that after the fact could be perceived as inconsiderate or even a bit manipulative.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions involved taking back money he already gave, which could be seen as unethical. The correct approach would have been to either give the $20 upfront or not take back the $5 once given. Hence, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
