I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person gave $5 to a girl who asked for money, but then the girl said they wanted $20 instead. The author then asked for the $5 back and walked away. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but the author isn't sure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The kids weren't homeless or impoverished, just looked untidy but clean, and no shoes. So maybe they were just asking for money for something specific, like a toy or something. The author initially gave $5, which is a generous gesture. But when the girl changed the request to $20, the author tried to get the money back. \n\nNow, when someone asks for money, the giver has the right to decide how much to give. The author gave $5, but the girl's response implying they wanted more could be seen as a bit of a trick. If the author didn't want to give $20, they're not obligated to. Taking back the $5 might be seen as stingy, but maybe the author felt they were being manipulated. \n\nOn the other hand, taking back the money after giving it could be considered rude. Once you give money as a donation, it's usually expected to be a final act. The girl might have felt the author was being dishonest by taking it back. However, the author might argue that they made a mistake and the girl's initial request changed. \n\nThe key points here are the intentions of both parties. The author might have felt misled when the girl asked for $20 after accepting the $5. But the girl might have just been negotiating for more. In such situations, people sometimes try to get more money by feigning dissatisfaction with the initial amount. \n\nSo, is the author at fault? If they gave the $5 intending to be charitable but then realized the girl was asking for more, they might have the right to take back the money, especially if they didn't want to give more. However, in charitable giving, once the money is given, retracting it can be seen as unethical. \n\nConsidering the context, the author's actions could be seen as self-protective. They gave $5, which is a decent amount, and when the girl asked for more (possibly expecting a larger donation), they decided to take back the $5 to avoid giving more. That's a personal choice, but it might come off as untrustworthy or a bit of a jerk move because the girl expected the $5 to be kept. \n\nBut the author is not in the wrong because they were not obligated to give money in the first place, and once they gave it, they could change their mind. However, the social norm usually is that once you give, you don't take it back. So the girlfriend's reaction makes sense. The answer might be a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because taking back the money after giving it could be seen as dishonest. But if the girl was trying to get more, maybe the author is justified. Hmm.\n"
