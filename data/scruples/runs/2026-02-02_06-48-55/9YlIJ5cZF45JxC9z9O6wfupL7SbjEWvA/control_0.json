I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to a kid and then taking it back when the amount was higher. \n\nFirst, the person gives $5 to a 12-year-old who asks for $20. After giving the $5, the girl says they need $20, so he takes the $5 back and offers a $20 instead. His girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but he's unsure.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the initial act of giving money and then retracting it. When someone offers money out of goodwill, but then changes their mind because the requested amount was higher, is that fair?\n\nThe girl and her sister approached him for money. The man gave $5, but upon realizing they wanted more, he took it back. The girls didn't look homeless or in dire need, just maybe not in bad shape. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, when you give money to someone, especially a child, and then take it back because they asked for more, that could be seen as inconsiderate. The initial act of giving might be seen as a kind gesture, and then reversing it could make the children feel embarrassed or rejected. \n\nHowever, maybe he thought he was being generous by offering a larger amount. But taking back the $5 he already gave could be perceived as stingy or insincere. People might expect that once you give money, you don't take it back. Especially to children, who might not understand the social nuances here. \n\nOn the other hand, he might have realized he didn't want to give $20, so he tried to correct his initial offer. But the way he did it\u2014taking the $5 back\u2014might have been abrupt. Perhaps a better approach would be to say, \"I can give $5,\" and leave it at that, rather than giving and then taking it back. \n\nThe girlfriend's opinion is that it was a dick move, which suggests that socially, it's considered rude. The man might have acted out of a good intention but executed it poorly. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he gave the money and then took it back, which could be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate to the children. Even if he didn't want to give $20, retracting the $5 he had already given might have been the wrong move. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
