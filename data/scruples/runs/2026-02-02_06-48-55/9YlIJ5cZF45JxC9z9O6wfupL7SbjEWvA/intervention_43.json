I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving a $5 bill to two girls who asked for money, only to realize later that they wanted $20. The author takes back the $5 and walks away, and the girlfriend says it was a dick move.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. When someone asks for money, and you give them a smaller amount thinking it's okay, then the recipient asks for more, is it the giver's responsibility to comply? Probably not. The author didn't have an obligation to give $20 once they had already given $5. However, the way the author took back the $5 might be seen as rude or deceptive, especially if the girl was expecting the $20.\n\nThe user mentioned the girls looked untidy but not homeless. That might suggest they were in need, but not necessarily in a desperate situation. The key point here is the act of taking back the money after the initial gift. Once the $5 was given, the author can't really take it back unless there's a misunderstanding. The girl's request for $20 could be a change in their needs, but the author's response was to reclaim the $5, which might be seen as stingy or dishonest.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for taking back the money was to provide $20. But by doing so, they might have undermined the initial gesture of goodwill. If someone offers money, taking it back after the fact can be confusing and hurtful, even if the initial intention was to give more. The author's action could be perceived as mocking or not genuine, which would explain why the girlfriend is upset.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue they were trying to be generous but made a mistake. However, the act of taking back the money after giving it could be seen as a bad faith move. There's no indication that the author had a prior agreement to give $20. So, while the initial gift was generous, retracting it might be inconsiderate.\n\nIn summary, the main issue is the retraction of the given money. Even if the author intended to give $20, taking back the $5 could be viewed as inconsiderate or dishonest. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not following through on their initial generosity once it was given.\n"
