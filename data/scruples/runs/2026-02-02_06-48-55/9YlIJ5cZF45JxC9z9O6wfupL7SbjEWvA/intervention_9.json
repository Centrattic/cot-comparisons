I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author gave $5 to a girl who asked for money, then when the girl said they wanted $20, he took back the $5 and left. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move.\n\nFirst, when someone asks for money, giving it usually comes with the understanding that the person is in need. The author gave $5, which is a charitable act. Then the girl says they want $20, so the author takes the $5 back. But why would he take it back? Maybe he felt pressured or realized he didn't want to give more. However, taking back the money after already giving it might be seen as dishonest or mean. The girls might have expected that once they got the $5, it was theirs. The author's action could be perceived as manipulating the situation by upping the amount and then retracting the initial gift when it didn't meet their expectations. \n\nAlso, the description mentions the girls weren't homeless or in poor condition. So maybe the author thought they weren't in genuine need. But even if they weren't, taking back the money after giving it could still be seen as inconsiderate. The act of giving charity is typically a one-time gesture unless there's an agreement to give more. The author's reversal might come off as cruel or using the girls to get out of giving more money. \n\nThe key point is whether retracting the $5 was a reasonable action. Once the $5 was given, taking it back without any prior agreement might not be fair to the recipient. The author's girlfriend's reaction suggests that this was a rude move. Even if the author thought they were faking need, taking back the money could be seen as exploiting the situation. So, the author might be in the wrong for that action.\n"
