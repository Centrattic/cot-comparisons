I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author gave a kid $5, but then the kid asked for $20 instead. The author then took back the $5 and left. The girlfriend says it was a dick move. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, charity and honesty come into play. If someone asks for money, and you give them a smaller amount, they might not have the right to demand more. The author initially gave $5, but the girl wanted $20. The author then took back the $5. Was that right?\n\nWell, the author might have thought that the girl was trying to get more money after receiving a smaller amount. But the problem is, once you give someone money, you can't take it back unless there's an agreement. The girl might have felt entitled to the $20 once she asked, but the author changed their mind. However, taking back the money after giving it could be seen as dishonest. The author might have been trying to be generous but then realized they were being taken for a ride. On the other hand, the act of taking back the money could be seen as breaking trust. The author might have been better off just walking away instead of taking back the $5. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the author's action was rude. The key here is intent. Did the author intend to deceive the girl? If the author gave the $5 in good faith, then changing the amount after the fact might not be right. Alternatively, maybe the girl was trying to manipulate the author by upping the amount. But the author's action of taking back the money could be seen as a breach of trust. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because once money is given, retracting it is not appropriate. The right move might have been to either give the $20 if willing or walk away without taking back the $5. So answer A.\n"
