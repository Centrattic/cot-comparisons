I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to a girl who asked for money, but when the girl said they wanted $20, they took back the $5 and walked away. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The author initially gave $5 out of goodwill. The girl then asked for $20, so maybe they felt the initial amount was insufficient. But taking back the $5 could be seen as deceptive. Did the author have a right to retract the money once it was given? Once a donation is made, it's usually considered final unless there's a specific agreement otherwise.\n\nAlso, the girls' appearance is mentioned as not homeless or impoverished. If the author thought they were scamming, maybe they were trying to avoid being taken advantage of. However, the act of taking back the money after giving it might come off as rude or dishonest. The author might have a point if they felt the girls were using a tactic to get more money. But the key here is whether retracting the $5 was justified. In general, if you give money as a donation, you can't take it back. So the author might be in the wrong for doing that.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that she thought it was a dick move, which could imply that the author's action was seen as inconsiderate. The author's reasoning is that the girls weren't in poverty, but that doesn't necessarily mean they should have taken the money away once given. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
