I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to the girls, then realized they wanted $20. They took back the $5 and walked away. The girls didn't look homeless or in need. So, did the author do something wrong?\n\nFirst, when someone asks for money, giving it is a kind act. The author gave $5, which is generous. But then the girl asked for $20. Maybe they felt pressured or wanted to help more. However, the key point is taking back the $5. Once the money is given, it's theirs. Taking it back might be seen as dishonest or rude, especially if the girl was in a vulnerable position. \n\nThe author's girlfriend thinks it's a dick move. The girls didn't look desperate, so maybe their request for more was just a test or a trick. But the author's action of taking back the $5 could be seen as taking advantage of a situation where the child might not understand the implications. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girls were just asking for money to buy something small, like candy, and then upping the amount when they were asked for something else, the author might feel justified in not giving more. But taking back the initial $5 is questionable. It's about intent. If the girls were trying to get more money, the author's response was to retract the previous help, which could be seen as manipulative.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for taking back the money once it was given, regardless of the girls' intentions. The action could be perceived as deceptive and exploiting the situation.\n"
