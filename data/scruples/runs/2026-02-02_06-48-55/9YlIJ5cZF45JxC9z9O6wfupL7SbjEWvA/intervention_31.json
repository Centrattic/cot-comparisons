I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author gave a child $5, then the child asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but the author is unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. When someone asks for money, especially a child, the giver might feel compelled to help. The girl initially asked for money, got $5, but then changed her mind and asked for $20. The author decided to take back the $5 and not give the larger amount. \n\nBut why would the girl ask for $20 after receiving $5? Maybe she thought $5 wasn't enough. However, the author's action of taking back the $5 could be seen as deceptive. Did the author know that the girl was going to ask for more? Probably not. The author might have thought that if the girl wanted more, they could ask from the start.\n\nBut the act of taking back the $5 and not giving it to the girl might have been confusing or hurtful. The author could have just said no to the $20 and left the $5 as a donation. Instead, by taking back the $5, the author might have made the situation awkward and possibly embarrassed the child. \n\nAlso, the description says the girls looked untidy but not homeless. So maybe they were in need, but not in a desperate situation. The author's actions might have been stingy or inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that they weren't obligated to give more money than they initially intended. If the girl wanted $20, she should have asked for that amount upfront. The author could argue that they were being polite by offering the $5 and then correcting the mistake when the girl asked for more. \n\nHowever, taking back the $5 after giving it could be seen as a form of manipulation. The author gave the money, then when the girl asked for more, he took it back. That might come across as a trick rather than a genuine act of kindness. \n\nIn some cultures or contexts, taking back a donation after it's given could be considered rude or dishonest. The girl might have thought she was getting $5 and then the author changed his mind. Even if the author had the right to take back the money, the way he did it might have been inconsiderate. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that she found it a dick move. That indicates societal judgment leaning towards the author being in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's action might be seen as inconsiderate or even deceptive, even if the intention wasn't malicious. The act of retracting the donation after giving it could have been hurtful and unnecessary. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
