I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is, the author was buying pizza and gave a little girl $5. The girl then asked for $20 instead, so the author took the $5 back and gave her a $20 bill. His girlfriend says it's a dick move, but he's unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The author gives $5, maybe as a small donation or tip. The girl then upped the request to $20. Taking the $5 back and replacing it with $20. The key points here are the intent of the author and the girl's actions.\n\nIf the girl was genuinely in need, asking for a higher amount might be seen as adjusting their request based on the situation. But the author took back the $5, which could be perceived as taking advantage. Even if the kids look untidy but not homeless, the act of taking the $5 back is questionable. The author might have thought he was being clever by giving a larger amount, but the way he did it\u2014retracting the initial offer\u2014could be seen as manipulative or disrespectful. \n\nAlso, the age of the children might be a factor. A 12-year-old might not have the same negotiating power as an adult. The author's action could be viewed as exploiting the situation. However, the author might not have had malicious intent. Maybe he felt generous and wanted to give more. The problem is in the method: taking back the $5 without offering it first. If he had offered $20 initially, that would be fine, but retracting the $5 after giving it could be seen as a lie or a bait-and-switch. \n\nAnother angle is the assumption that the girl's request for $20 was a test. The author might have thought the kids were trying to get more money, so he took the $5 back. But in that case, the author's approach is still problematic because he didn't confirm the need for $20 before giving the $5. The initial act was a gift, and taking it back could be seen as keeping the door open for negotiation, which isn't fair to the children if they were genuine in their request. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is a clue. She thinks it's a dick move, implying that the author's action was inconsiderate. People might feel that when you give someone money, even if it's a small amount, you can't just take it back if they want more. That could be seen as a lack of honesty or generosity. On the other hand, if the author believed the initial $5 was a mistake and wanted to correct it by giving more, but the children were just trying to get more, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the way it's described, the author gave $5, then upon being asked for $20, took back the $5 and gave a $20. The act of taking the money back could be viewed as a lie because the author had already given the $5, then took it away. \n\nAlso, the children's appearance is mentioned as untidy but not homeless. That might suggest they're not in dire need, which could imply they were testing the author's generosity. If that's the case, the author's action might be justified. However, even if they were testing, the act of taking the money back is still a bit underhanded. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if someone is asked for charity, increasing the amount is fine, but retracting a given donation could be seen as unethical. The author might have felt he was being generous, but the way he handled it could be problematic. The initial $5 was a gift, and taking it back might be seen as a breach of trust. The author should have either given the $20 from the start or not taken back the $5. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong. Because he gave the money and then took it back, which is misleading. Even if the kids were trying to get more, the author's action of renegeing on the $5 is not ethical. Alternatively, if the kids were just being greedy, but the author thought he was correcting his mistake, maybe not. But the act of taking the money back is where the issue lies. The author didn't have to give more, but taking back the initial donation might be the wrong move. \n\nI think the consensus here would be that the author's action was wrong. The initial $5 was given as a donation, and then taking it back when the child asked for more could be seen as stingy or manipulative. The correct approach would be to either give the $20 if you're willing, or not give anything. Taking back the $5 might be perceived as a trick, especially with children who can't be expected to handle such situations. So answer A.\n"
