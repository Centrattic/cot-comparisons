I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to a child.\n\nSo, the author was buying pizza and approached by two girls, around 12 and 6. They asked for money. The author first gives $5, then when the older girl asks for $20 instead, the author takes back the $5 and walks away. His girlfriend says it's a dick move, but he's unsure. The girls looked untidy but not homeless.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about intent and honesty. When the author gave the $5, it was an initial offer. The girl then changed the request to $20. But when the author tried to take back the $5, that's where the issue might be. The problem is that once you give someone money, you can't just take it back unless there's an agreement. The author gave the $5, then tried to retract it when the girl asked for more. That could be seen as deceptive because the girl might have expected the $5 as a gift. Taking it back after the fact might be considered unethical or unfair, even if the person realized they wanted more. It's like if someone gives a gift and then asks for it back because they changed their mind. That's generally frowned upon. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the act of taking back the money was rude or inconsiderate. The girls' appearance isn't homeless, so maybe they were just kids playing a trick or testing people. The author's action could be seen as taking advantage of their initial generosity and then retracting it, which is the wrong move. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
