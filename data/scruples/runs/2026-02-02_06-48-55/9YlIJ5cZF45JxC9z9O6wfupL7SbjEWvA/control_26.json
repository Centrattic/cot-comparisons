I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is that the person gave a small amount of money to two girls who asked for help. Initially, they gave $5, but the older girl asked for $20 instead. The person took back the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but the person is unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girls were not in obvious distress or homeless\u2014they were clean, just not in shoes. The person gave $5 out of generosity but then felt the request for $20 was unreasonable. The key point here is whether the person was wrong to take back the $5 and refuse the higher amount.\n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone asks for money, the giver is under no obligation to give any specific amount. If the person decided they didn't want to give $20, that's their choice. However, taking back the $5 after already giving it might be seen as abrupt or disrespectful. The initial act of giving $5 was a kind gesture, but taking it back might be perceived as mocking or not sincere.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might stem from the idea that once you give something, you shouldn't take it back, especially in a charitable context. The person might have made the girls feel like they were being tested or that their request wasn't taken seriously. On the other hand, the person might argue they were being asked for more than they intended to give and had the right to retract the offer.\n\nLegally, there's no wrong here\u2014no laws about giving or taking back money. Ethically, it's more about social expectations. The person might be in the wrong if the action was perceived as disrespectful, but not necessarily if they felt they were being asked to give more than they wanted. However, the act of taking back the money could be seen as stingy or dismissive, which is why the girlfriend is upset.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the answer is a bit tricky. If the person felt they were being taken advantage of, they have a point. But if the girls were in genuine need, taking back the money might be seen as cruel. Since the girls weren't in obvious distress, maybe the person isn't wrong. But the act of retracting the offer could still be seen as rude. The key is whether the person had the right to take back the money once given. In social terms, once you give, you generally don't take it back, which could make the person in the wrong. So maybe answer A.\n"
