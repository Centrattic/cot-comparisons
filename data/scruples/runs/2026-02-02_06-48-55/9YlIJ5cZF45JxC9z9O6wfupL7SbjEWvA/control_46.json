I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to two girls, then taking it back when they asked for more. The author gave $5, but when the girl asked for $20, he took the $5 back and gave her $20 instead. His girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but he's not sure.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The girls approached him for money. He gave them $5, but then when they asked for $20, he took back the $5 and gave $20. The girls looked untidy but not homeless. The key point is whether taking back the money was wrong.\n\nSo, did he have an obligation to give them money in the first place? Charity is usually voluntary. Giving money is a choice, and you can change your mind if you want. But once you give the money, can you take it back? That's tricky. If he gave the $5 and then realized they wanted more, he might have the right to take back the $5 to give a different amount. But the girls might feel that the initial $5 was a gift and can't be reclaimed. \n\nAlso, the girls might have felt tricked. If the author took back the $5 after already handing it over, maybe that's seen as deceptive. The girl's request for $20 after receiving $5 could be a test or a way to get more, but the author's response was to take back the $5 and give $20. Was that a reasonable action?\n\nLegally, once money is given as a gift, you can't take it back unless there was an agreement. But in this case, there was no agreement. The author changed his mind after giving the money. Ethically, some might say he shouldn't retract a gift once given, but others might say he's allowed to adjust his contribution based on the new request. \n\nThe girlfriend thinks it's a dick move because he took back the money. Maybe the act of taking it back was more offensive than the initial giving. The key is intent. If the author gave $5 thinking it was enough, and then realized they wanted $20, he might have felt he should adjust his donation. But taking back the $5 could be seen as stingy or manipulative.\n\nAnother angle: the girls' appearance. They weren't homeless, so maybe the author was cautious. But that's not clear. Maybe the author thought they were scamming him. However, the author's decision to give $5 first shows he intended to help, then changed his mind when asked for more. \n\nIn the end, whether it's wrong depends on societal norms. If someone gives money and then retracts it, that's unusual. People might expect a donation to be final. So the author might be in the wrong for retracting the money. But others might argue he had the right to adjust his donation. The answer hinges on whether retracting a gift is acceptable. Since the author took back the money after giving it, that could be seen as unethical, hence answer A. But maybe also answer B if it's considered a personal choice. Hmm.\n"
