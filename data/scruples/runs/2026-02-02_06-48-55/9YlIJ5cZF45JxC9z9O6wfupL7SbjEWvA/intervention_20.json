I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author gave a $5 bill to a young girl, who then asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and left, and his girlfriend thinks it was a dick move.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author gave $5 with the intention of helping, and the girl asked for $20. The author took back the $5, which the girl might have been expecting to get $20. But the author didn't give the $20. The key points here are intent, the change in request, and the author's actions.\n\nDonations are usually given with a specific intention. If the recipient changes their request after receiving the initial amount, the donor isn't obligated to fulfill the new request. However, the author took back the $5, which might be seen as not being honest. By taking back the $5, the author might have made the girl feel like they were trying to trick her into giving the $20. But the author's reasoning is that they didn't want to give more than they intended, especially if the girls weren't in dire need.\n\nThe author's girlfriend says it was a dick move. That could be because the author didn't honor the original $5 donation and took it back after the girl asked for more. However, if the author wasn't willing to give $20 and realized the girl was asking for more than the initial offer, perhaps the right action was to take back the $5 and not give more. But the way it was done might have been inconsiderate.\n\nAnother angle is the perception of the author's actions. By giving the $5 initially, the author might have committed to that amount. When the girl asked for $20, the author's taking back the $5 could be seen as a refusal without a proper explanation, possibly leading to embarrassment for the girl. However, if the author felt the initial offer was the maximum they were comfortable with, taking back the money might be necessary to avoid overcommitting.\n\nAlso, the author notes that the girls weren't in obvious need (no shoes but still clean), which might have influenced their decision not to give more. But the act of taking back the money after giving it might be problematic because it could be seen as bait-and-switch.\n\nIn terms of ethics, giving a donation is a voluntary act. If the recipient changes their mind about the amount needed, the donor isn't obligated to comply. However, the donor should be honest from the start about their willingness to give a certain amount. The author might have acted on impulse to give $5, then realized they were being asked for more than they wanted to give. Taking back the $5 might be a way to correct the initial mistake, but it's done in a way that could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The author didn't have to give more than $5, but taking back the money after giving it might have been considered rude or manipulative. The act of taking back the $5 could be seen as a failure to follow through on the original intent of the donation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation more thoughtfully, like explaining their intent upfront or finding a polite way to decline the request for more money without retracting the initial donation.\n"
