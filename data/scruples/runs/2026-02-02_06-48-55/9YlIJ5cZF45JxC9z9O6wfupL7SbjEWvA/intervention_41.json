I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author gave a 12-year-old girl $5, but then the girl asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend says it was a dick move, and the author is asking for opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author offered money initially, maybe out of kindness, but then when the girl asked for more, he took it back. The key points here are intent and perception. Why did the author give the $5 in the first place? Was it a genuine act of charity, or was it something else? The author says the girls weren't impoverished or homeless, which might suggest that the author didn't think they were in real need. But the girl still asked for more money after receiving some.\n\nNow, the author's action of taking back the $5 could be seen as either stingy or as a realization that the initial donation wasn't enough. But taking back the money after giving it might come off as mean-spirited, especially if the author had already committed to the donation. People might expect that once someone gives money, they don't take it back just because the requester wants more. The author's girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, which implies that the action was considered rude or inconsiderate.\n\nAnother angle is the child's behavior. The 12-year-old asking for money might not be in the right situation to be asking for funds. However, the author's response was to retract the initial donation because the amount was insufficient. But once money is given, taking it back could be seen as a breach of goodwill. It's possible that the girls were just asking for a specific amount they needed, and the author's refusal to honor the higher request made him look like he was being cheap or mocking.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned that the girls looked untidy but not homeless. So, the author might have thought they were just asking for money for something minor, not a critical need. But regardless, taking back the money after giving it might be considered inconsiderate. People might expect that if you can't give a higher amount, you just say so instead of taking back the initial donation.\n\nIn terms of social norms, once you give something, it's generally not done to take it back unless there's a reason like fraud or misunderstanding. Since there's no indication of fraud here, the author's action could be seen as a betrayal of trust. The girl might have been expecting the $5 and then surprised by the request for $20. The author's refusal to honor the higher amount by just giving the $20 instead of taking back the $5 could be seen as a cheap move.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author felt that the initial $5 was a mistake because the girl was asking for more, he might have thought he was correcting the mistake. However, that reasoning is a bit flimsy because once the money is given, retracting it without a good reason is usually frowned upon. The author could have just said no to the $20 request instead of taking back the $5. That would have been more polite.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's action was probably inconsiderate and stingy, making the girlfriend's reaction valid. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
