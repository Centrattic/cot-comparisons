I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person handed $5 to a girl who then asked for $20. They took back the $5 and left. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the initial act of giving $5 was a donation. Then the girl asks for $20. The author offers to take back the $5 and give $20 instead. Wait, no, the user says he took the $5 back and walked away. Wait, the user gave $5, then the girl said they want $20. The user says sorry, take back the $5, and get a $20. Then he took the $5 back and left. So he didn't give the $20. \n\nSo the key points here: Did the girl have any claim to the $5 after he gave it? Once he gave the $5 as a donation, it's hers. But then he took it back. But he had already given it. Is it possible that he had a change of heart because the request was higher? But taking back the money after giving it might be seen as deceptive. Or maybe the girl was just asking for more, but the author didn't follow through. \n\nThe girl and her sister approached asking for money. The author gave $5, but then the older girl asked for $20. The author then took back the $5 and left. The problem is that once he gave the $5, it's a completed transaction. Taking it back could be seen as dishonest. Alternatively, maybe the author realized they couldn't afford to give $20 and decided to take back the $5 to avoid giving more. But the way he did it\u2014taking back the $5 after giving it\u2014could be seen as a trick or not being upfront. \n\nAlso, the girls weren't in obvious need, which might make the author question his decision. But the act of taking back the money after giving it might come off as insincere or even mocking. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move because he gave money but then took it back. If he didn't want to give $20, he should have said no from the start instead of giving $5 and then retracting.\n\nSo in terms of right or wrong, taking back the money after giving it could be considered wrong because it's not the done thing. Donations are supposed to be given willingly and not taken back unless there's a mistake. The author's actions might have been seen as stingy or insincere. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
