I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is that they gave a little girl $5, and then the girl asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and walked away. His girlfriend says it was a dick move, but he's not sure.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The person gave $5, then the girl asked for $20. The author took back the $5. The girl and her sister don't seem to be in dire need, just maybe not in the worst shape. The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nSo, when someone asks for money, and you give a smaller amount, but they want more. If you take back the initial amount, is that okay? Well, when you give someone money, they can't take it back once given, right? But in this case, the person took it back. Did the girl have the right to keep the $5? Or was the author justified in taking it back because the girl changed her mind?\n\nI think the main issue here is that once you give money as a donation, it's supposed to be a gift. Taking it back might be seen as deceptive. But maybe the author thought that since the girl asked for $20, he was correcting his mistake. However, he gave the $5, then took it back. The problem is that the initial giving might not have been a mistake; maybe the girl just wanted more. So, taking back the $5 after giving it could be seen as inconsiderate or even rude because the girl might have already counted on that money. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that the girls didn't look homeless or in extreme need. But that's not the point. If they asked for money, regardless of their situation, taking back a donation after giving could still be considered wrong. However, if the author felt lied to or tricked, maybe it's different. But in this case, there's no indication that the girl was scamming. She just asked for more money than he initially offered. \n\nSo, if you give someone a smaller amount than they asked for, and they want more, you can't take back your initial donation. The author might have thought he could retract the $5 because he misunderstood the situation, but once the money is given, it's theirs. Taking it back could be seen as dishonest. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
