I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author gave $5 to two girls who asked for money, then tried to take it back when they said they wanted $20 instead. The author took the $5 back and gave nothing else. The girlfriend thought it was a dick move. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, when someone asks for money, the giver can choose how much to give. The author gave $5, which is their right. Then the girls said they wanted $20. The author, perhaps realizing that $5 wasn't sufficient, took back the $5 to give $20. But wait, that's not how transactions work. If you give someone $5, you can't take it back once they ask for more. It might come off as manipulative. The girls might have been testing the author, or maybe they were trying to get more money. The author's action of taking back the $5 could be seen as dishonest because they gave the money with the intention of it being a gift, and then reversing that decision when the recipient asked for more. \n\nAlso, the description mentions the girls looked untidy but not homeless. The author might have thought they were faking their need. However, that's an assumption. Even if they weren't really in need, the act of taking back the money after giving it could be seen as deceitful. The author's reasoning is that they didn't want to give $20, so they took back the $5. But once money is given, the recipient owns it unless there's a prior agreement. The author's action might be perceived as taking advantage of the situation, which could make them in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt misled if the girls were pretending to need money. But the initial request was for any spare change, and they asked for $20 after receiving $5. The author's response was to take back the $5 to give $20, which is confusing. The author could have just said no to the $20 request instead of retracting the $5. That might have been a more straightforward approach without causing confusion or perceived dishonesty.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action of taking back the money after giving it might be seen as inconsiderate or manipulative, making them in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
