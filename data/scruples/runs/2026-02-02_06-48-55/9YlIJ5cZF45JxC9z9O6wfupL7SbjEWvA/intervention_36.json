I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to a kid and then taking it back.\n\nSo, the author gave $5 to a little girl who asked for spare change. Then the girl asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend says it was a dick move. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's intention was to help, perhaps expecting a small donation. The girl then changes her request to $20. The author might have felt tricked or taken advantage of, so taking back the $5 could be seen as a way to not give more than intended. However, once the money is given, even if there's a misunderstanding or a change in request, taking it back might be perceived as rude or dishonest.\n\nThe girl's appearance is mentioned as untidy but not impoverished. So maybe the author assumed they weren't in genuine need, which might affect the judgment. If the author gave the $5 with the understanding it was a donation, then taking it back after the fact could be seen as breaking a social contract. Even if the girl's request changed, the initial act of giving might imply a commitment. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they were misled. If the girl asked for $5 and then immediately upped the amount, it could be seen as a tactic to get more money. In that case, the author's action of retracting the $5 could be self-protective. However, the way it was done\u2014taking the money back\u2014might not be the best approach. A better response could be to refuse the new request without taking back the initial donation.\n\nSo, considering social norms and expectations, once a donation is given, taking it back could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the recipient is in a vulnerable position. The author might be in the wrong for retracting the money after the initial act of generosity, even if they felt misled. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
