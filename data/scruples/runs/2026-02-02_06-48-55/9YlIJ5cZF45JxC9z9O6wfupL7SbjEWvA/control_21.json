I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves giving money to two girls, then realizing they wanted more and taking the money back.\n\nFirst, the author gives $5 to a girl who then asks for $20. The author takes back the $5 and gives nothing. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move. The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nLooking at the facts: The girls approached asking for money. The author initially gives $5, but upon being asked for more, takes it back. The girls aren't described as homeless or in dire need, just untidy but clean. \n\nI need to consider intent and social norms. When someone asks for money, giving an amount is a donation. If the recipient is unhappy with the amount and asks for more, the donor isn't obligated to give more. However, taking back the initial donation could be seen as deceptive because the author gave the money intending to help but then took it back when asked for more. \n\nBut the author might argue they were being manipulated. The key issue is whether taking back the money was unethical. The author didn't know the girls' situation well. If they had given $5, it's a donation. If the girl then asks for more, the author isn't required to comply. However, taking back the money after giving it could be seen as a breach of trust. Alternatively, maybe the author acted impulsively and changed their mind, which isn't necessarily wrong because donations are optional. \n\nAnother angle: The author might have felt misled after giving $5 and realizing it wasn't enough. But the initial request was for money, not a specific amount. The girl's sister might have been involved too. The author's action could be seen as stingy or using a tactic to avoid giving, but if they didn't want to give $20, they weren't obligated. The problem is taking back the $5, which the girls might have expected to keep. \n\nIn terms of social expectations, people might view taking back a donation as dishonest. However, if the author didn't have the intent to give $20, they were within their rights to retract the $5. But the way it was done\u2014taking it back after giving\u2014could be seen as a trick, hence the girlfriend's disapproval. \n\nBalancing these perspectives, the answer depends on whether retracting the donation was dishonest or a legitimate change of heart. Since the author didn't know the girls' situation, maybe they were cautious. However, once the money was given, taking it back could be considered inconsiderate, even if the author felt manipulated. So, the author might be in the wrong because they took back a donation after the fact, which can be perceived as a cruel trick rather than standing by the initial generous act or not giving at all.\n"
