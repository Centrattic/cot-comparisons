I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for taking back $5 they gave to a child who then asked for $20. So, first, they gave $5 intending to help, but the girl then upped the amount. The key points here are the initial intent to give money, the subsequent request for a larger amount, and the action of retrieving the $5.\n\nThe person says the girls looked untidy but not homeless. That might suggest they weren't in dire need. But the main issue is whether it's wrong to take back money that was given. If they handed over $5 and then the girl asked for $20, maybe the person felt they were being taken advantage of. But in the moment, the person decided to take the $5 back. \n\nNow, legally, if someone gives money as a gift, they can't take it back. However, in this case, the person initially gave $5, then changed their mind when the request increased. The problem is that once the money is given, the recipient owns it. Taking it back after the fact could be seen as unethical. The person might argue they were tricked or that it was a mistake, but that's debatable. \n\nThe girlfriend is upset, which might mean the person's actions hurt the child's feelings or caused her to feel disrespected. Even if the situation was questionable, taking back the money could be perceived as stingy or rude. The person could have instead said they can't give $20 and offered something else, like $5. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they gave the money and then took it back, which isn't a valid action once it's transferred. Their girlfriend's reaction might be justified as it could have been a poor way to handle the situation.\n"
