I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author gave a $5 bill to a 12-year-old girl who asked for money. Then the girl says they want $20 instead. The author takes back the $5 and walks away. His girlfriend says it was a dick move, but he's unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girls approached the author asking for money. The author gave them $5, but when told they wanted $20, he took back the $5. The key points here are the initial act of giving $5 and then taking it back when the amount increased.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, giving money to someone in need is a kind act. However, in this case, the girls changed their request. If the author had known they wanted $20, he might not have given $5. But by taking back the $5, he's essentially rescinding his initial donation. That could be seen as deceptive if the girl expected the $5 to stay given. The author might argue that he acted on a misunderstanding, but once the $5 was given, taking it back might look like he's taking advantage of the situation.\n\nAlso, considering the girls' appearance: they weren't homeless or in clear need, which might make the situation more about taking advantage of the author's generosity. If they were genuinely in need, the author's action could be seen as a good deed followed by a misunderstanding. But if they were just asking for more money after getting some, the author's reversal could be viewed as the right move to avoid being taken advantage of.\n\nBut the author's action of taking back the $5 and then walking away might come off as rude or dismissive. People often expect that once a donation is given, it's final. Taking it back could be perceived as a breach of trust, even if the recipient changed their request. However, the author had the right to decide how much to give. The problem is that by initially giving $5, the author might have committed to that amount, and then changing it could be seen as a bad move.\n\nI think the main issue here is the author's action of taking back the money after giving it, which could be seen as rude or dishonest, especially if the girls expected the $5 to be final. On the other hand, if the author felt he was being taken advantage of, he had the right to retract his donation. The gray area is whether it's acceptable to take back money once given in a situation like this. Different people might have different views, but from a moral perspective, once the $5 was handed over, taking it back might be considered wrong because it undermines the trust in charitable giving. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
