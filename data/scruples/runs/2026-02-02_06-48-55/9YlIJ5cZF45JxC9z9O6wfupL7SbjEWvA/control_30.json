I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking back the money they gave to a kid. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThey were getting pizza and gave a little girl $5. The girl then asked for $20 instead. He took back the $5 and left. His girlfriend says it was a dick move. The girls looked untidy but not homeless.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are: the initial giving of $5, the girl then asking for more, and then the person taking back the money.\n\nFirst, when someone is asked for money, usually it's a donation, so the giver isn't obligated to give more. The person gave $5, but then the girl asked for $20. He tried to take back the $5 and give $20, but realized he didn't have that. Wait, wait, no, the story says he took the $5 back. Wait, he gave $5, then the girl said they wanted $20. He said sorry and asked for the $5 back to give $20. But he took the $5 and walked away, meaning he didn't give $20 after all. So he took back the $5 he gave. So the question is, was that wrong?\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The initial action was giving $5, which was a donation. The girl asked for more, but the author didn't have the intention to give $20. By taking back the $5, he's essentially retracting his donation. But is that ethical?\n\nIn some cases, once you give money, it's theirs. But maybe the author realized they didn't want to give $20, so he tried to take back the $5. However, once you give it, you can't take it back. If the girls were in need, taking it back might be seen as unfair. However, the author might have felt pressured into giving the $5 and then realized they didn't want to commit to more. On the other hand, the girls might have been testing people for money, given their appearance (untidy but not homeless). \n\nThe girlfriend thinks it was a dick move because maybe the author went back on his word. But if the girls were just trying to get money, the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the author gave the $5 in good faith, then taking it back could be seen as unethical. \n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. If the author gave the $5 voluntarily, then taking it back after the girl asked for more might be considered inconsiderate, especially if the girl was in a position where she needed the money. But if the girls were just trying to get money from people, then the author isn't wrong. The scenario says they looked untidy but not impoverished. So maybe they were just asking for money for their own purposes. \n\nIn that case, the author isn't in the wrong because he didn't have to give money in the first place, and if he changed his mind after giving, it's his right. But if the girl was in genuine need, then taking back the money could be seen as wrong. However, the author didn't give the $20, so maybe he wasn't obligated to. \n\nSo considering all factors, the answer might be B (No), because the author wasn't obligated to give the money in the first place and could retract his donation if he felt it was a mistake. But some might argue that once you give, it's theirs. However, since the author immediately took it back, maybe it's not a problem. Alternatively, if the girl was in need, taking back the money could be seen as cruel. \n\nBut the description mentions that the girls looked untidy but not homeless, so maybe they weren't in dire need. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because he made a mistake in giving and then corrected it. So the answer is B.\n"
