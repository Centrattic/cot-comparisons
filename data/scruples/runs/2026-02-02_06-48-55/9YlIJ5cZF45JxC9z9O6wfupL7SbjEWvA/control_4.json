I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is they gave a little girl $5, but then the girl asked for $20 instead. The writer took back the $5 and left. His girlfriend says it was a dick move, but he's unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The girl initially asked for money, maybe expecting a small amount. The writer gave $5, but then the girl said they wanted $20. So he took back the $5 and left. The key points here are about honesty, the intent behind the donation, and whether the writer acted inappropriately.\n\nWhen someone asks for money, it's usually a request, and the giver can choose to give any amount they feel comfortable with. The girl changing her mind after receiving the initial amount might be seen as trying to get more than originally asked. But maybe the writer felt misled? However, once the $5 was given, taking it back could be seen as rude or breaking trust. \n\nThe writer's action of taking back the money might have made the girls feel disrespected. Even if the girls were not in dire need, the act of charity is about the giver's goodwill. The writer might have felt that they were being asked for more than they were willing to give, but the way he took back the money could have been abrupt.\n\nAlso, the age of the children is a factor. A 12-year-old asking for money might not be in a position to manage such a situation well. Maybe they were just trying to get as much as possible, but the writer's response was harsh.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that she thinks it was inconsiderate. The writer might have acted on impulse, not considering the children's feelings. Even if the girls weren't homeless, the act of giving and then retracting could still be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer might have felt that the initial $5 was a mistake once the girl asked for more. But once a donation is made, it's generally not appropriate to take it back unless there's a specific reason. The writer's action might have been seen as stingy or lacking empathy.\n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone gives money with good intentions, retracting it could be viewed as disrespectful. The writer's decision to take back the money might have been a mistake, even if the girls' request for more was unexpected.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer might be that the writer is in the wrong because he took back the money after giving it, which could be seen as rude or breaking a social contract of generosity.\n"
