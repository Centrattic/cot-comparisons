I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong. The situation involves giving a kid $5 and then taking it back after the kid asks for $20 instead.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author gives $5 to a girl, who then says they actually want $20. The author takes back the $5 and leaves, leading the girlfriend to say it was a dick move. The author is now asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key elements here are the initial act of giving $5, the girl's request for $20, and the author's response. The author's reasoning might be that they didn't want to give more money, so they took back the $5. But the girlfriend thinks it's rude.\n\nI need to consider the social norms here. When someone asks for a different amount after receiving money, is it the donor's responsibility to correct that? If the girl asked for $20, maybe the author could have said no politely instead of taking back the $5. Taking it back might seem abrupt or mocking, especially if the kids are in a vulnerable position. Even if they're not homeless, the act of taking back the money could be seen as condescending or not trusting them with the initial amount.\n\nAlso, the author's comment about the girls not being impoverished might imply that they don't deserve help, but that's a bit judgmental. Maybe the author thought they were being tricked, but that's an assumption. The appropriate response would be to say they can't give more, not to take back the money given.\n\nSo, in terms of social etiquette, taking back the money after giving it could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might have felt justified in not giving more, but the way they handled it was perhaps not respectful to the children's request. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
