I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they gave a kid $5, but then the kid asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and left. The girlfriend says it was a dick move, but the author isn't sure. The kids looked untidy but not homeless.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the act of giving money to someone in need. When someone asks for money, especially kids, giving is a kind gesture. But when the author gave $5, the kid then asked for more. That might be a test or a trick. Maybe the kids were trying to see if the author would give more. If they asked for $5, maybe they just wanted that. But when they said $20, did they really need it? The author took back the $5 and walked away. \n\nNow, the author's action of taking back the $5\u2014was that okay? If you give someone money, you can't just take it back unless there's a misunderstanding. But in this case, the initial request was for money, and the author gave $5. Then the kid changed the request to $20. The author might have felt tricked, so taking back the $5 to give the correct amount makes sense. Wait, but the author didn't actually give the $20. They took back the $5 and left. So they didn't follow through on the $20, which they had agreed to give. That could be seen as breaking a promise. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the kids were scamming. If they had no real need and just wanted more money, the author's reaction was to protect themselves from being taken advantage of. The kids looked clean and not homeless, so maybe they weren't in real need. The author might have realized they were being played and decided not to give more. \n\nBut the problem is that once the author gave the $5, taking it back after the kid asked for $20 could be rude. Because the kid was expecting the $5, and then when they asked for $20, the author took back the $5 and walked off. That could come off as abrupt and maybe even cruel, even if the kids weren't in desperate need. The author might have been trying to be good but got caught up in a situation where the kids were testing people. \n\nSo the key points are: Did the author have an obligation to give the $20 once they took back the $5? Or was it their right to change their mind? Since the initial $5 was given, taking it back because the kid asked for more might not be the right approach. Maybe the better action would be to not give any money in the first place if they suspected the kids weren't in real need. Or if they did give $5, they should keep the $5 and not take it back. \n\nThe girlfriend thinks it's a dick move because the author went back on their word. Even if the kids were scamming, taking back the money after giving it could be seen as stingy or breaking trust. Alternatively, if the author thought they were being scammed, it's a self-defense move. \n\nI think the answer depends on the intent. If the author gave $5 out of compassion, then taking it back because the kid wanted more could be seen as not being genuine. But if the author realized they were being played, taking back the money is a reasonable response. However, the act of taking back the money after giving it might have been the mistake. Maybe the better approach was not to give in the first place if they felt uncertain. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe. Because once you give money, taking it back isn't polite unless there's a reason. If the kid had asked for $20 first, the author might not have given any. But by giving $5 and then taking it back, they might have been inconsistent. The answer is probably A (Author is in the wrong) because the action of taking back the money after giving it could be seen as rude and breaking a promise, even if the situation was suspicious. The author's reaction was abrupt and might have been more about protecting themselves than considering the kids' actual needs or the social contract of giving.\n"
