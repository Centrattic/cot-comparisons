I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person went to get pizza, gave $5 to a girl who asked for money, then when the girl said they wanted $20, took back the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author is unsure.\n\nFirst, when someone asks for money, giving it is a kind act. But when the girl upped the request to $20, the author tried to retract the initial $5. The key point here is whether the author had a duty to follow through once he gave the $5. \n\nInitially, the author gave $5 based on the first request. When the girl changed the request to $20, the author had the right to change his mind. However, taking back the $5 might be seen as deceptive because the girl might have expected the $5 as a gift. The author didn't ask for it back immediately, which could imply he was committing to the initial donation. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as a bit of a game. By giving the $5 and then taking it back when the request increased, he's playing on the girl's expectations. The girl might have felt manipulated, especially if they were trying to get more money. \n\nAlso, considering the age of the children, they might not be in a position to ask for money like adults. It's possible they were just practicing or didn't fully understand the situation. The author's decision to take back the money could be seen as taking advantage of their inexperience. \n\nOn the other hand, the author wasn't obligated to give the $20. He had the right to refuse the increased request. But the way he took back the $5 might come off as dishonest because it's like he gave without commitment and then rescinded when terms changed. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't clearly state his intention to give the $5 as a non-negotiable donation. By taking it back after the girl asked for more, it could be perceived as a trick, which isn't fair to the children. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
