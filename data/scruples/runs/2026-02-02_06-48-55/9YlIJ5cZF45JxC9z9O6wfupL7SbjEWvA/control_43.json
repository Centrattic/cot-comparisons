I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after taking back money given to a kid. So, the situation is they gave a child $5, the child then asked for $20 instead, and the person took back the $5 and gave nothing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. When someone asks for money, maybe expecting a larger amount, but the giver initially gives a smaller amount. Then the recipient changes their mind. Did the giver make a mistake by taking back the $5?\n\nThe user mentions the girls looked \"untidy\" but not homeless. So maybe they were just in need, but not in an emergency. The author gave $5, then when asked for $20, took back the $5. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move. \n\nI think the key points are: Did the author have an obligation to give $20 once they gave $5? Probably not. The initial offer was $5. The child then changed their request. The author was within their rights to take back the $5 if they were going to give a different amount. However, the way it's done might matter. Taking back the $5 and giving nothing could be seen as stingy or rude. Alternatively, maybe the author could have given $20 instead. \n\nBut the author might have felt tricked or like the child was trying to get more money. If the child asked for $5 first and then upped the amount, maybe they were testing the person. The author might have felt disingenuous and decided not to give anything. However, taking back the $5 could be seen as not being generous or maybe even deceptive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that they were not obligated to give $20. They gave $5 in good faith, but when the request changed, they took back the money. The problem here is whether it's wrong to retract a donation once given. Some might say that once you give, you shouldn't take it back, even if the request changes. Others might say that if the person felt the initial amount was too low and the child was trying to get more, retracting is okay.\n\nThe user's girlfriend thinks it's a dick move. So, perhaps there's a social expectation here. Maybe the author should have given $20 if they could, or at least not taken back the $5. Alternatively, maybe the author was justified in feeling like the child was trying to get more money and decided not to give anything. \n\nAnother angle: The child might not have the capacity to understand the implications of asking for money. If it's a child, maybe the author should have considered that and not tried to negotiate. But the author might not be responsible for the child's actions. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. The author isn't legally wrong, but socially, maybe they're seen as inconsiderate. The answer could depend on cultural norms. In some places, it's considered rude to take back money once given. In others, people might be more understanding if the person felt the request was insincere.\n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether retracting the money was the right social action. If the author thought the child was trying to get more money, taking back the $5 is a way to not overcommit. But if the child was genuinely in need and just asked for a higher amount, the author could be seen as withholding help. \n\nGiven the context, the author might be in the wrong because once you give a donation, retracting it can be seen as stingy. However, if the person felt the initial request was insincere, maybe not. The answer isn't clear-cut, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they gave $5, then took it back, leaving nothing. That could be seen as a mean action, especially if the girls needed the money. \n\nAlternatively, the author might just be honest about their limits. If they only wanted to give $5, but the child wanted $20, they could have said no to the $20. But taking back the $5 shows they didn't want to give anything, which could be harsh. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because they retracted a donation after the fact, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, there's a counterargument for B. But given the girlfriend's reaction and the general social expectations, A is more likely the correct answer.\n"
