I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that they gave a little girl $5, which she then said they wanted $20 instead. He then took back the $5 and left. His girlfriend says it was a dick move. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person initially gave $5, then the girl asked for $20. The author then took back the $5 and walked away. The key points here are: was the initial $5 a donation, and did the girl's request for $20 change the situation?\n\nDonations are typically considered gifts, which are usually irrevocable once given. So if the author handed over $5 as a donation, he might not have the obligation to give more. However, when the girl asked for $20, the author took back the $5. This action could be seen as rescinding the donation once he found out more information. But is that ethical?\n\nThe author's girlfriend thinks it was a dick move. That suggests she feels he was being condescending or manipulative. The author's reasoning is that the girls looked untidy but not homeless. The fact that they didn't ask for $20 initially might be why he decided to take back the $5. However, once a donation is made, even if the person changes their mind, taking back the money could be seen as dishonoring the initial gesture.\n\nAnother angle: the author gave $5 and then took it back upon the girl's request for more. If the author felt compelled to give more, he could have done so, but taking back the original amount might appear stingy or deceptive. Alternatively, he could have said he couldn't give more. The act of taking back the money after giving it might come across as insincere or mocking.\n\nAlso, the age of the children is a factor. A 12-year-old might not be trying to scam but could be genuinely asking for help. However, the fact that they had a specific amount in mind after the initial offer might be a red flag. The author might be questioning their authenticity, hence taking back the money.\n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, if the author believed they were being asked for more than they were willing to give, he had the right to not give more. However, once the money was given, taking it back might not be appropriate. The line between being cautious and being rude is thin here.\n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone gives a donation and then takes it back, it can be perceived as disrespectful. The author's girlfriend's reaction supports that. So while the author might not be legally in the wrong, socially, it could be seen as a poor move.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author is in the wrong because he gave money as a donation and then rescinded it, which can be seen as a breach of trust or insensitivity to the recipients' situation. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
