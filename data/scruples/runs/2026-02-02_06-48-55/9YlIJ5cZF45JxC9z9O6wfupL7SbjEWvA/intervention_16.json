I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to two girls, first $5, then taking it back when they ask for $20. The author is divided on whether they did the right thing. The girlfriend says it was a \"dick move,\" but the author isn't sure.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The person gives $5 to the girls, who then ask for $20. The author takes back the $5 and leaves. The author's reasoning is that the girls didn't look homeless or impoverished, just maybe a bit untidy but clean, and no shoes. The author is trying to figure out if they were wrong for taking the money back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. When someone asks for money, especially a child, there's an expectation that the giver is being generous. Giving $5 is a kind act, but when the child asks for more, the giver might feel pressured or think they're being taken advantage of. However, once the money is given, taking it back could be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate, especially if the child is in need.\n\nBut the author mentions that the girls looked untidy but not homeless. So maybe the author is trying to assess if the girls were genuinely in need. If the author thought they weren't in dire need, perhaps they felt justified in taking back the money. However, the action of taking back the money after a child's request might still be seen as rude, regardless of the situation.\n\nAnother angle is the interaction itself. The author gave $5, then when the child asked for $20, the author took back the $5. This could be perceived as mocking or belittling the child's request. Children might not have the same social cues as adults, and their requests might be genuine even if they don't look homeless. The author's decision to retract the money could be seen as a breach of trust or generosity.\n\nBut the author might argue that they were being polite initially, and upon realizing the request was higher than expected, they adjusted. However, once money is given, it's a done deal. Retracting it could be seen as taking advantage of the child's trust. The author might not have considered the child's perspective, making it an insensitive move.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author believed the girls were not in genuine need, they might feel justified. But the act of taking back the money after a request for more could still be considered inconsiderate. The key here is whether the author's action was a reasonable response to the situation or if it crossed a social boundary.\n\nIn summary, while the author might have thought they were being cautious or not giving too much, the act of taking back the money after giving could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
