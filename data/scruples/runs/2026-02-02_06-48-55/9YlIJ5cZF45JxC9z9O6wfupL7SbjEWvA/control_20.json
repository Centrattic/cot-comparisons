I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking the money back after initially giving $5 to the girls.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author gives $5 to two girls who asked for money. The older girl then says they wanted $20. The author offers to exchange the $5 for $20 but then takes back the $5 and leaves. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author isn't sure. The girls aren't in obvious distress like homeless or impoverished, just maybe untidy but clean.\n\nSo, the key points here. Was the initial giving of $5 a voluntary donation? If yes, then can the author take it back once they realize the girls might not need it as much as they thought? Legally, once money is given, it's theirs. But the author didn't actually give $20, so maybe he's not in the wrong for not following through on a verbal agreement. But wait, he took back the $5. When he first gave it, it was a gift. Then, when the girl asked for $20, he tried to retrieve the $5 to give more. But then he walked away. So technically, the $5 was given as a donation. Taking it back might be an issue because the girls already received it. The author might have thought he was giving a larger donation, but the girls didn't specify the amount initially. \n\nMoral aspect: Was the author's action deceptive? The girls didn't present a hardship situation. The author gave money based on their request but then changed his mind when they asked for more. However, taking back the $5 after giving it might be seen as dishonest because the girls now have the money. The author could have just not given more but taking back the initial amount might be perceived as unfair. \n\nAnother angle: The girls might have been testing the author, seeing if he'd give more. The author realized this and corrected the mistake. But once the $5 was given, taking it back might not be appropriate. If the author wanted to give $20 initially, he could have asked for the $5 back, but once the money is given, it's theirs. So perhaps he shouldn't have taken it back. \n\nSo, the answer depends on the ethics of taking back a gift after realizing a mistake. Legally, once given, it's theirs. Morally, maybe the author should have just stopped at the initial $5 without trying to retrieve it. By taking it back, he's reversing his initial generosity, which could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the girls needed the $5. But the author's reasoning was that they weren't in dire need, so maybe he thought the $5 was wasted. \n\nBut the key here is that the author didn't actually give the $20, so he's not following through on a promise. However, he did offer to exchange the $5 for $20. By taking back the $5, he's backing out of that offer. The problem is that the $5 was already given as a donation. So the author's action of retrieving the $5 might be seen as taking back a gift, which isn't appropriate once given. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he took back a gift after giving it, perhaps based on a misunderstanding or a change of heart, which isn't acceptable.\n"
