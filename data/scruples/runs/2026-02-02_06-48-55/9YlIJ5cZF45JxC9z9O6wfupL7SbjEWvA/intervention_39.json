I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they gave $5 to a girl who asked for money, and then when the girl said they wanted $20, they took the $5 back and gave her $20. The girlfriend says it was a dick move. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the act of giving money. The author gave $5 initially, which is a kind gesture. Then the girl asked for $20, so maybe she thought the author could give more. The author then took back the $5 and gave $20. Wait, but taking the $5 back... Is that okay? If the author gave the $5 as a gift, then taking it back might be seen as dishonest or manipulative, especially if the girl expected to keep the $5 and then get an additional $15. But the author might argue that they were just correcting their mistake, thinking they should give the full $20 instead of $5. \n\nBut here's the thing: once you give money to someone, even if they're asking for more, can you take it back? If the author gave the $5 and then realized they wanted to give $20, maybe they should have just added $15 more instead of taking the $5 back. Taking it back could be seen as treating the initial gift as a mistake or an error, which might be disrespectful. Especially if the recipient felt that the $5 was a good offer and then the person is taking it back to give more. The girls might have been confused or felt disrespected.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girls weren't in obvious poverty. That might make the situation more about testing the author's generosity. If they're not in dire need, maybe they were trying to get as much as possible. But the author's initial act was generous. Taking back the $5 to give $20 might have been a way to fulfill the request, but the method could be problematic. \n\nAnother angle: the author may have felt pressured to give more after the initial request. But once money is given, retracting it isn't typical. It's like if you give someone a $5 bill and then say \"Wait, I meant to give you $20,\" and take it back. That's not how donations usually work. People expect that once you give money, it's theirs. So the author might have been trying to be generous but did it in a way that was confusing or unkind.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's action of taking back the $5 might be seen as inconsiderate because it could make the girls feel manipulated or as if the author was using them to get rid of the $5. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that it was a dick move. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
