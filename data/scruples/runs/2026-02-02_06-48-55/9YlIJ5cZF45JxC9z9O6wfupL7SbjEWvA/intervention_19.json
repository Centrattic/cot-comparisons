I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that they gave a girl $5, but then when the girl asked for $20 instead, they took the $5 back and gave her $20. The author's girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the user is unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author gave $5 initially, but the girl then asked for $20. The author then took back the $5 and gave her $20. The girls looked untidy but not homeless. So the key points here are about the ethics of giving money to a child, changing the amount requested, and the author's actions in taking back the $5.\n\nI think the author's mistake was in taking back the $5. Once they gave the $5, even if the girl changed her request, the author shouldn't have taken it back. It's not appropriate to take money back after it's been given, especially to a child. The girls might have been testing the author or had their own reasons for asking for more, but the author's action of taking back the $5 could be seen as dishonest or manipulative. Also, giving money to a child who is asking for it can be a gray area. The author might have thought it was a charitable act, but retracting the gift once the amount was increased could be seen as taking advantage of the situation. The fact that the girls weren't in obvious distress might also play into whether the author had a responsibility to give. So, the author's actions might be in the wrong because they took back the money after giving it, which isn't ethical.\n"
