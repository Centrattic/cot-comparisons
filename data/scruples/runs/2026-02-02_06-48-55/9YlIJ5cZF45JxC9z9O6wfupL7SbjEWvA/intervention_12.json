I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to two girls, thinking they were in need. Then the older girl asked for $20 instead. The person took back the $5 and left.\n\nFirst, the initial action was giving money out of kindness. But when the girl changed the request, the person had to decide. They took back the $5, which might have been seen as taking advantage. The girls didn't look homeless, so maybe they were just asking for a bigger amount. \n\nIs it wrong to retract the money once the request changed? If someone asks for a certain amount, gives a smaller one, and then the request is increased, is the person obligated to give more? Probably not. But maybe the way they did it was abrupt. They didn't offer an alternative, just took back the money. The girl might have been testing their response or trying to get more. \n\nThe person's girlfriend thinks it was a dick move because they gave money initially but then took it back. However, the person might have felt pressured into giving $5 and realized they weren't in a situation where they needed charity. The girls' appearance was clean, so maybe they weren't genuinely in need. \n\nSo, the person might be in the wrong because they gave under the assumption of a $5 request, then when it changed, they took back the money without explanation. Alternatively, they had the right to change their mind, especially if they realized they were being asked for more than intended. \n\nBut taking the money back after giving it could be seen as exploiting the situation, especially if the girls were in need. However, since they didn't look homeless, maybe the person was right to question the need. It's a bit of a gray area. The key points are the initial giving, the change in request, and the abrupt retraction. \n\nIn the end, maybe the person isn't in the wrong because they had the right to decide how much to give. But the way they did it might have been inconsiderate. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the person can change their mind, but some might argue A (in the wrong) for retracting after giving. Need to decide based on the situation's nuances.\n"
