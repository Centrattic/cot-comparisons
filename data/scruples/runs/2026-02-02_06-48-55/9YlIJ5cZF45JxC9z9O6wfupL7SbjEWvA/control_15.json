I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to a girl who initially asked for money, but then the girl asked for $20. They took back the $5 and left. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move.\n\nFirst, the initial act of giving $5 was generous. But when the girl changed her request to $20, the person might have felt they were being taken advantage of. The key points here are intent and the situation. The girl's request changed, so the person decided to withdraw their offer. \n\nThe author argues that the girls didn't look homeless, which might imply they weren't in dire need. But is it right to take back the money once given? Well, once money is given, it's a completed act. Taking it back might be seen as breaking trust. However, the person might have felt tricked or that the initial $5 wasn't sufficient. \n\nThe question is about being in the wrong. The act of giving $5 was kind, but taking it back after seeing a higher request could be seen as stingy or not generous. Alternatively, maybe the person was just correcting their mistake or realizing they wanted to give more. \n\nBut since they took back the $5 and walked away, the girl was left with nothing. The initial act of giving was good, but retracting it might have been abrupt. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the person's actions were hurtful. \n\nIn some contexts, taking back money could be seen as a breach of trust. However, if the person felt they were being asked for more than intended, maybe it's understandable. But the situation might have been handled better, like explaining they can't give more instead of taking back the money. \n\nSo, there's a balance between generosity and personal boundaries. The author might have overstepped by taking back the money after giving it, which could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the person felt misled, then B could be the case. But the main issue is that once you give money, taking it back isn't a great move. So probably A.\n"
