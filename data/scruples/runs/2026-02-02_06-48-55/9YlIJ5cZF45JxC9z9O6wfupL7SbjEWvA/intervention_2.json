I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by taking back the $5 after the girl asked for $20. First, I need to consider the situation. The author gave $5 to a girl, but then the girl asked for $20 instead. The author took back the $5 and left. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move.\n\nSo, the key points here: Was the author's action justified? When you give money to someone, especially a minor, there's no legal obligation to give more. The initial $5 was a donation, and the girl increasing the request after the fact doesn't bind the donor to give more. The author had the right to take back the $5 since it was a voluntary act and not a binding agreement.\n\nHowever, socially, there might be considerations. The girls might have been in need, but the author wasn't in a position to evaluate their circumstances. The author might have felt pressured or tricked into giving $5, then realized they were being asked for more. Taking back the money could be seen as a way to avoid being taken advantage of, especially if the author felt they were being swindled.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might argue that once the money was given, taking it back after the request was increased could be seen as rude or dishonest. The author might have created a situation where the girl expected more, then retracted the initial gift. But legally and ethically, as long as there was no prior agreement, the author can take back the money. The girl's change in request doesn't obligate the author to honor it.\n\nAlso, the description mentions the girls were not in dire straits, so the author might not be as concerned about their need. The author's actions were within their rights, even if it came off as abrupt. The main issue is whether the author overstepped by taking back the $5 after the initial gift. Since the author isn't under any obligation, the answer would lean towards not being in the wrong. But there's a social aspect where the action might be seen as lacking empathy or consideration, hence the girlfriend's reaction. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, which is a moral judgment. Legally, no. Morally, it's debatable but not a clear wrong. So answer B.\n"
