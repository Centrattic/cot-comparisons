I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves giving money to two girls, first $5, then taking it back when the older one asks for $20.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The author gives $5 to a 12-year-old and her sister. The older girl then says they want $20, so the author takes the $5 back. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author is unsure. The girls aren't in obvious distress, just untidy but not homeless.\n\nI should consider intent here. The author gave $5 out of kindness, thinking they might need help. But when the older girl asks for $20, maybe she expected more. The author took back the money, which could be seen as stingy or maybe the girl was testing their generosity. \n\nBut wait, the author gave the $5 and then took it back when asked for $20. Is that okay? Legally, once the money is given, it's theirs. So taking it back isn't legal, but the author didn't actually give it yet. Wait, the author gave the $5, then took it back. So the author took back the $5 to give a larger amount. But maybe the girl was trying to get more money. \n\nEthically, the author might be seen as being inconsiderate by taking back the $5. The initial act was generous, but rescinding it might make the children feel embarrassed or manipulated. Also, the girls' appearance isn't a sign of real need, so maybe the author shouldn't have given money in the first place. \n\nBut the author could argue that they were trying to be helpful, but realized the children weren't in dire need. Alternatively, the author might have felt tricked into giving more. \n\nI need to decide if the action was wrong. If the author took back the money because they realized the children weren't genuinely in need, maybe it's understandable. However, the act of taking back a gift can be seen as rude, especially if the recipient felt they had a right to it. \n\nThe girlfriend thinks it's a dick move because you can't take back a gift once given. But the author didn't actually give the $5 to the older girl yet; they took it back before handing over the $20. Wait, the original scenario says the author gave the $5, then took it back. So the $5 was given, then taken back. That's a bit different. \n\nWait, the author says they gave the $5, then the girl asked for $20. The author then takes the $5 back. So the author is taking back the initial gift because the girl asked for more. This might be seen as treating the children as if they're begging for money, which is a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone asks for money, giving a small amount is one thing, but taking it back when the person asks for more could be seen as rude or stingy. However, the author might have thought they were being reasonable by not giving more. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the older girl was trying to get more money by first taking the $5 and then asking for $20. The author's action could prevent that. But the initial $5 was a gift, so the author can't take it back unless there's an agreement. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they gave the money as a gift, then took it back, which is not typical. Gifts are usually given without conditions, so retracting them could be rude. But if the author felt tricked, that's different. \n\nThe key here is the intent and the perception. The girls weren't in dire need, so maybe the author shouldn't have given money in the first place. But once given, taking it back might be seen as wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they gave the money and then took it back, which is not a common practice. It could be seen as treating the children as if they were trying to get money, and the author's action is stingy and rude.\n"
