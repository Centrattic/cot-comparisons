I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story did something wrong when they took back the $5 they gave to two girls. The situation is that the author gave the older girl $5 as a charitable act, but when the girl asked for $20 instead, the author took back the $5 and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girls approached the author for money, which is a common request. The author gave $5, thinking it was a generous gesture. Then, the older girl asked for $20, which the author might have found surprising or even a bit of a problem. The author took back the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but the author isn't sure.\n\nThe key points here are intention and the interaction. When someone gives money as a donation, it's typically with the understanding that it's a one-time gift. If the recipient then asks for more than what was given, the donor isn't obligated to provide it. However, taking back the initial gift after it's been given might be seen as dishonest or stingy, depending on the perception. \n\nFrom one angle, the author might have felt misled if the girl initially asked for $20 but then settled for $5. However, the story says the girl first asked to spare some money, and the author gave $5. The girl then said they wanted $20. So the initial request wasn't for $20. The author's response was to take back the $5 and offer $20, but instead, the author just walked away after taking back the $5. \n\nTaking back the money could be seen as a way to retract the donation upon realizing a mistake, but since the donation was already given, retracting it might be considered rude or inconsiderate. The girls might have expected the $5 and were then disappointed when the author took it back. The author's action could be perceived as a lack of follow-through or insincerity. \n\nAdditionally, the fact that the girls were not in obvious distress (untidy but clean, no shoes but not homeless) might make the situation less urgent. However, the author's intention was to help, and changing the decision after the fact could be seen as undermining the initial act of kindness. \n\nIn terms of ethics, once a donation is given, it's generally considered a gift and can't be reclaimed unless there's a prior agreement. The author might have felt they were being taken advantage of, but the way they handled it\u2014taking back the money\u2014could come across as abrupt and disrespectful. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because retracting a gift after it's been given is generally not acceptable unless there's a specific reason. The action could be seen as breaking trust and being inconsiderate to the recipients' feelings, even if the author had second thoughts later.\n"
