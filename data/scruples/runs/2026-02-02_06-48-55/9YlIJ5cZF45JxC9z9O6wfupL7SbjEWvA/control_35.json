I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to two girls who asked for money, but then when the older one asked for $20 instead, he took back the $5. His girlfriend says it was a dick move. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, when someone asks for money, you can choose to give any amount you want. The initial $5 was a gift, right? Then the girl changed her mind and asked for $20. The author didn't have to give more, but he tried to take back the $5 he already gave. That's where the problem arises. Once you give money as a gift, you can't just take it back unless there's an agreement for something in return. Since there was no exchange, taking back the $5 could be seen as dishonest. Maybe the girls were just testing him or had a plan, but the author's action of taking back the money after giving it might be considered misleading. The girlfriend's reaction makes sense because it's a bit of a bait-and-switch. So, the author might be in the wrong because he gave money with the expectation it was a donation, and then revoked it when the request changed, which isn't a typical or fair practice. Hence, Answer A.\n"
