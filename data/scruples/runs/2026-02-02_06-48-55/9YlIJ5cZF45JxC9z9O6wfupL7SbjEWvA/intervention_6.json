I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking back the $5 after the girl asked for $20. The situation is a bit tricky. The author gives $5 to two girls, maybe 12 and 6, who asked for money. Then the older one says they want $20, so the author takes back the $5 and walks away. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move, but the author is unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. When someone asks for money, and you give them a smaller amount, but they then say they actually need more. If the person is genuinely in need, taking back the initial amount might be seen as stingy or not helping enough. However, the author mentions they looked untidy but not homeless. So maybe they weren't in dire straits.\n\nAnother angle is the intention. The author gave $5 out of kindness, but when the girl asked for $20, he took it back. Was he being genuine in his initial offer? If he couldn't afford to give $20, maybe he shouldn't have given $5 expecting to get it back. But if he thought they were scamming, then taking it back might be justified. The fact that they looked untidy but not impoverished suggests they might not be in real need. \n\nAlso, the act of taking the money back after the initial giving could be seen as manipulative. The author might have given $5 with the intention of not giving more, but then when the girl asked for more, he retracted the $5. That could come off as insincere. However, there's no obligation to give money to strangers, and the author can change his mind.\n\nThe key points are: were the girls in genuine need? Did the author have the right to retract the money once given? In most cases, once you give money, you can't take it back, but if the person is trying to negotiate a higher amount, maybe it's reasonable. But if the initial offer was a genuine offer, retracting it might be seen as a dishonest move.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that they looked untidy but not impoverished. So maybe he thought they were not in genuine need. The girlfriend's reaction says it was a dick move, implying that the author was being stingy. But if the girls weren't actually in need, maybe the author is justified.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author gave money but then took it back when asked for more. On the other, if the girls weren't in real need, he might have been right to not give more. But the act of giving and then retracting could be seen as inconsiderate. So maybe the author is in the wrong for being insincere. Answer A.\n"
