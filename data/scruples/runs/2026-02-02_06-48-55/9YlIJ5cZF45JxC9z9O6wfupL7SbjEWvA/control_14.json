I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for taking their money back after giving $5 to a kid who then asked for $20.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author gave $5 to a girl who then said they wanted $20. He tried to take back the $5 to give her $20, which seems like a good intention. However, the girl's sister said they wanted $20, so he might have taken the $5 back to give a larger amount. But the key point here is whether he had the right to take the money back once he gave it.\n\nLegally, once money is given to someone, it's considered a gift unless there's a contract. So if he gave the $5 as a donation, he can't take it back. However, in this case, the girl asked for $5, then changed her mind and asked for $20. The author might have thought he could take back the $5 to give more. But from the girls' perspective, they might feel that the $5 was already given and taking it back was deceptive.\n\nEthically, it's about intent. The author's intention was to correct his mistake and give more, but the action of taking the money back without the recipient's consent could be seen as dishonest. Even if the girls weren't in need, the act of retracting a gift after giving it could be considered rude. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that taking back the money was a poor move.\n\nAnother angle is the girls' possible motives. They might have been testing the person's generosity, but the author's response could have been to give $20 from the start instead of taking back the $5. Alternatively, he could have asked for the $5 back politely if they wanted a different amount. However, taking it without their agreement might have been abrupt.\n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong because once money is given, taking it back without consent can be seen as unethical, even if the intention was to give more. The action could come off as manipulative or disrespectful to the recipient.\n"
