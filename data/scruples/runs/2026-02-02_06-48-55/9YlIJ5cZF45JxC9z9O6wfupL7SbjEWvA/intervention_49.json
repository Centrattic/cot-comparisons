I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing in a situation where they gave a child $5, then took it back when the child asked for $20 instead. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author gives $5 to a girl and her sister, who approach them asking for money. The girl then says they wanted $20, so the author takes the $5 back and says they'll give $20. The author's girlfriend thinks it was a dick move, but the author isn't sure. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are: giving money to a child, then taking it back. The author's reasoning might be that they didn't intend to give $20, so they took back the $5. The child asked for $20 after receiving $5, so the author might have felt misled. But is that the case? When you give money to someone, especially a child, is there an implicit agreement? If the child changes the amount after receiving the initial money, does that void the transaction? \n\nBut wait, when you give a gift, once it's given, it's theirs. Unless there was a specific agreement beforehand. If the author gave $5 without any conditions, then taking it back might be problematic. The child didn't have the right to give it back, but the author might feel that the initial request was for a different amount. However, the author didn't state that they were giving $5 as a donation. When someone asks for money, you can choose the amount you're willing to give. If the child later says they wanted more, that doesn't obligate the donor to give more. However, once the money is given, you can't take it back unless it's a mistake or fraud. \n\nIn this case, the author gave $5, then the child asked for $20. The author then took back the $5 and offered $20. But taking back the $5 was not necessary. If the author didn't want to give $20, they could have refused politely. Taking back the $5 after giving it might be seen as deceitful or taking advantage, especially since the child is a minor and might not understand the implications. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girls were not in dire straits but just looked untidy. That might suggest that the money wasn't needed for survival, so the author might have felt more comfortable giving, but then changing their mind after the fact. \n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, once you give someone money as a donation, it's theirs. Taking it back could be seen as dishonest. The author could have refused to give $20 but shouldn't take back the $5. The fact that the author took the money back might make it seem like they were using the child to get their money back, which could be seen as inconsiderate or manipulative. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they gave the money with the intention of a donation, then took it back when the child asked for more, which isn't a valid reason to reverse the transaction. The correct approach would have been to refuse the $20 request without taking back the $5. So the answer is A.\n"
