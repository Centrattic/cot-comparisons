I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about giving money to a kid and then taking it back. So the author was buying pizza and gave a 12-year-old girl $5 when she asked for money. Then the girl said they wanted $20 instead. The author then took back the $5 and walked away, and the girlfriend says it was a dick move.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the ethics here. When someone asks for money, especially a child, what's expected? If you give someone money, you can't just take it back unless there's a specific agreement. The author gave $5, then tried to take it back when the girl asked for $20. That seems a bit manipulative. The girl might have been playing a trick, but the author gave the money first. Taking it back after the fact could be seen as dishonest because once you give someone money, it's theirs. \n\nAlso, the girls looked untidy but not homeless. Maybe they were just kids playing a game. The author's action might have been a way to feel superior or to test them, which isn't nice. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she thought it was rude. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author wasn't obligated to give money in the first place. They could have said no. However, once they gave the $5, they shouldn't take it back. So the author's action of taking back the money after giving it could be considered wrong because it's not a good faith transaction. It's like giving money with the expectation of more, which is a bit of a bait-and-switch. \n\nI think the key point is that once you give someone money, you can't just take it back. The author's behavior might have been a bit of a prank, but it's not appropriate. So the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
