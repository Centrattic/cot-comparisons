I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person gave $5 to a girl who asked for money, then when the girl said they wanted $20, he took back the $5 and left. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, when someone asks for money, giving it is a kind gesture. But once the money is given, it becomes the recipient's property. The author took back the $5 after the girl changed her request to $20. That could be seen as a bit of a trick, because the girl might have expected the $5 to be kept, even if she initially asked for $20. But he didn't give the $20 he promised. \n\nWait, the author said, \"give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.\" So he took back the $5 but didn't actually provide the $20. That's a problem. He made a commitment to give $20 in exchange for the $5, but didn't follow through. That seems deceptive. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl might have been trying to get more money by first asking for $5 and then upping the ante. But the author's response was to take back the $5 and walk away, which could be seen as a way to avoid giving more. However, he didn't honor his promise to give $20 once the $5 was returned. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is that it was a dick move. That's a subjective opinion, but maybe she feels that once you give the $5, you can't just take it back because the recipient changed their mind. The author might have thought he was being clever, but the act of taking back the money after giving it away, then not following through on the $20, is ethically iffy. \n\nAlso, the girls' appearance is mentioned. They weren't homeless or in dire straits, so maybe the author thought they were just asking for more money than they needed. But regardless of that, the author's action of retracting the donation after the fact could be seen as dishonest. \n\nIn terms of ethics, when you give money to someone, they have a right to it. If you want to adjust the amount, you should clarify before giving. The author gave the $5, then when the girl asked for $20, he tried to reverse the transaction, which isn't standard. So, the author is in the wrong because he didn't follow through on his promise to give $20 once the $5 was returned. That's a breach of trust.\n"
