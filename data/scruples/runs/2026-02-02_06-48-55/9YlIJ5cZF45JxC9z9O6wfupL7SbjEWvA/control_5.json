I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is about giving money to two girls, then taking it back when they asked for more.\n\nFirst, the author gave $5 initially. The girl then asked for $20. The author took back the $5 and walked away. The girlfriend thinks it's a dick move. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nHmm. So, when you give a gift, it's generally considered a donation. Once given, it's theirs. The author took it back after giving it, which might be seen as deceptive. Because once the $5 was given, the author can't just take it back just because the girl changed her mind. The author might have felt pressured, but that's on them for giving in the first place. The author's action could be seen as taking advantage of the situation. Even if the kids weren't in dire need, the act of taking back the money after giving it is unethical. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But maybe the author thought they were negotiating? But you can't retract a gift like that. So yeah, probably A.\n"
