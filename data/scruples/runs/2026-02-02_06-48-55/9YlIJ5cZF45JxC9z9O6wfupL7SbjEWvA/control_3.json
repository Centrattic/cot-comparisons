      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author was buying pizzas and on the way back to the car, two girls approached him. The older one, around 12, and a younger sister, 6. They asked for money. He gave them $5, then the girl said they wanted $20. He asked for the $5 back and walked away. His girlfriend says it was a dick move, but he's unsure. The girls were untidy but not homeless or impoverished.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points are: he gave $5, then when the girl asked for $20, he took back the $5. So, he initially gave money out of generosity, then changed his mind when they asked for more. The question is whether this is wrong.\n\nFirst, when he gave the $5, maybe he thought it was enough. But then the girl said they wanted $20. Does that mean she was misleading him from the start? Like, maybe they were planning to ask for more. Or maybe she just realized they needed more and was being honest. But then the author took back the money, which could be seen as deceptive because he gave it and then took it back when they asked for more. \n\nBut wait, he said he gave the $5 and then when the girl said they wanted $20, he offered to take back the $5 and give $20. But instead of giving $20, he just took the $5 back and left. So he didn't give the $20 he had promised. That's a bit of a contradiction. If he was going to give $20, he should have done so. But he just took back the $5. That could be seen as dishonest because he led them to believe he would give $20 but didn't follow through. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author realized that they were just trying to get more money, so he decided not to give anything. But taking back the $5 after giving it is a bit of a trick. Also, the girls' appearance: they were untidy but not homeless. Maybe they were just kids asking for money for something, but not in serious need. \n\nThe author's girlfriend thinks it's a dick move because taking back the money after giving it could be seen as inconsiderate. The initial act of giving $5 was kind, but retracting it when asked for more might come off as rude or manipulative. \n\nAnother angle: when someone asks for money, and you give them an amount, they might not have a set amount in mind. If the girl asked for $20 after receiving $5, maybe she was just trying to get more. The author might have felt tricked, so he took back the $5. But the way he did it could be seen as wrong because he gave the $5 in good faith and then took it back, which could be confusing or hurtful to the girls. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author didn't have to give money in the first place. But once he did, taking it back might not be the best approach. Maybe he should have just said no to the $20 request without taking back the $5. However, the scenario is a bit ambiguous. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he gave money and then took it back, which could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the girls were trying to get more. Alternatively, if the girls were trying to manipulate him, maybe the author was just protecting himself. But the act of taking back the money after giving it could be seen as dishonest or rude. \n\nI think the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because he gave the $5 and then took it back, which can be perceived as a poor decision, especially if the girls were in need. Even if they asked for more, retracting the initial gift might be seen as not generous or considerate.\n"
