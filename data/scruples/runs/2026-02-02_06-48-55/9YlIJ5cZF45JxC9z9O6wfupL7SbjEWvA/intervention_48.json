I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves giving $5 to two girls, then when they ask for $20 instead, taking the $5 back and walking away. The girlfriend says it's a dick move, but the author is unsure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The initial act of giving $5 is generous, but when the girls ask for more, the author takes back the money. Is that deceptive? The key point is whether the author had the intention to give $20 from the start. By giving the $5 and then taking it back, the author might be seen as using the girls to get the $20 without actually intending to give it unless they had to. \n\nAlso, the girls' appearance is mentioned as untidy but not homeless or impoverished. That might suggest they weren't in immediate need, which could influence the perception of the situation. If they were scamming, the author's action could be self-protective. However, taking the money back after giving it could be seen as a lack of honesty. \n\nLegally, there's no wrongdoing, but ethically, it's a gray area. The author might be in the wrong for retracting the money once the request changed, as it could be seen as a manipulative tactic to get more. On the other hand, the author might not have intended to give $20 and is just trying to avoid being taken advantage of. \n\nThe answer would depend on the intent and the perception of the situation. If the author's action was to deceive the girls into taking back the $5 so he could avoid giving $20, then yes, that's in the wrong. If he genuinely wanted to give $20 but had to take the $5 back to fulfill the new request, maybe not. But the way he walked away after taking back the $5 suggests he didn't intend to give $20 at all, which makes it a bit of a manipulation tactic. So, the answer is A.\n"
