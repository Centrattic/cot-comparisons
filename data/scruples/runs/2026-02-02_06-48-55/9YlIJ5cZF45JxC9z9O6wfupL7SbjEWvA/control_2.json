I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is they gave a kid $5, then the kid asked for $20, so they took the $5 back and walked away. The girlfriend says it was a dick move, but the author isn't sure.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the context. The person gave $5, then the kid asked for more. The author took back the $5 and left. The girl said they looked untidy but not homeless. So the question is, was that the right move?\n\nHmm. When someone asks for money, giving it is a kind gesture. But if the kid then asks for more, maybe the person didn't expect to give more. The author might have thought they were being taken advantage of, so they took back the $5. But the problem is, once the author gave the $5, they can't really take it back. It's like handing over the money and then changing their mind. That might be seen as rude or dishonest because the kid might have been expecting to keep it. \n\nAlso, maybe the kids were just testing people, or maybe they needed the money. If they weren't homeless, maybe they were just being pushy. But taking back the money could be seen as a betrayal of trust. The author might have thought they were being polite by giving, but then backing out when asked for more. However, the initial act of giving was generous, and retracting it could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nAnother angle: when the author gave the $5, the kid changing the request to $20 might be a trick to get more money. The author might have realized that and decided not to give more. But once the money is given, taking it back is not a good idea. The proper thing would have been to not give in the first place if they weren't prepared to give more, or to explain they can't give more and let the $5 stay. \n\nSo the author's action of taking back the money could be seen as wrong because it's not fair to take back a gift after giving it. The person might have felt they had a right to the money once they were given it. The author's decision to retrieve it might make them look dishonest or inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, if the kids were trying to get more money by changing the request, the author could be protecting themselves from being taken advantage of. But the method they used was to take back the money, which is the issue. \n\nIn summary, the key point is that once you give money, you can't take it back. The author's action might be seen as wrong because they didn't follow through on their initial kindness. So the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
