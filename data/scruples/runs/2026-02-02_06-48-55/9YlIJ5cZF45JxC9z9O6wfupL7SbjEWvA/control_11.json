I figured yeah I probably do, grabbed $5 from my wallet and handed it to her. She looks at me and says 'We want $20 please\", I say oh sorry sure, give me the $5 back and I'll get you a $20. So I took the $5 and walked away. \n\nGirlfriends saying it was a dick move but I'm not sure. The girls looked untidy (no shoes but still clean) definitely not impoverished or homeless. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person handed the girls $5, then when they asked for $20 instead, he took back the $5 and left. The girlfriend says it was a dick move, but the author is unsure.\n\nFirst, when someone asks for money, giving it is a charitable act. But the girls changed their request after receiving the initial amount. The author gave $5, then the girls asked for $20. He tried to take back the $5 to give a larger amount but then walked away without providing the $20. \n\nThe key point here is whether the author had an obligation to follow through. Once he gave the $5, he might have felt he could revoke it if the request changed. However, taking back the $5 after giving it could be seen as a breach of trust. The girls might have felt misled if they thought the author was going to give $20 but he didn't. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about the girls not being in dire need (since they weren't homeless or impoverished) might influence the judgment. If the girls were genuinely in need, taking back the money could be harsh. But if they weren't, maybe the author's hesitation is understandable.\n\nHowever, the act of taking back the money after giving it might be seen as disrespectful or cruel. The author might be in the wrong because once he gave the $5, retracting it could be perceived as a trick or a refusal to honor the initial act of kindness. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that he had the right to change his mind since the request was altered. But the way he handled it\u2014taking back the $5 and then not giving the $20\u2014could be seen as deceptive. \n\nSo, the main factors are: the initial act of giving, the change in request, the revocation of the initial gift, and the perception of the girls' need. Considering these, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't follow through properly and possibly insulted the girls.\n"
