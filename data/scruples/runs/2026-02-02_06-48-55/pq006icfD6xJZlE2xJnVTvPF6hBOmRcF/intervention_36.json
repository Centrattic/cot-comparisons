We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The situation involves a 29-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man with Asperger's. They had been dating over a year, she was in a tough financial situation, moved in with him after losing her job, and he provided her with support. Now she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him, leading to his devastation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman was in a financially unstable position, moved in with Justin who was her employer (since she was cleaning his apartment). He supported her financially, bought her things, and she moved in with him. Then she got a better job, became more financially stable, and ended the relationship. The question is whether she's in the wrong here.\n\nThe user thinks she is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. I need to evaluate the relationship dynamics. Justin is 20, she's 29. There's a significant age gap, which might affect the relationship's maturity. He has Asperger's, which can impact communication and emotional understanding. The woman mentions she doesn't love him as he does. She broke up, which he took badly. She tried to console him and even suggested friends-with-benefits, which he rejected.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, ending a relationship because you no longer feel the same is generally acceptable, especially if one is unhappy or the relationship isn't reciprocal. However, the context here includes financial dependency. The woman was relying on Justin financially after losing her job, and now that she's stable, she's leaving. This could be seen as taking advantage of his situation, especially if he was emotionally invested and she's moving on for her own financial reasons. But she did break up with him before getting the job? Wait, no\u2014she got the job and then broke up. So the timing is important. She didn't break up because of the job, but perhaps because she felt more secure and realized her feelings weren't mutual. \n\nThe woman's actions: she ended the relationship, which he took hard. She tried to comfort him. The issue is whether she's in the wrong for breaking up when he was financially supporting her. Some might argue that she's being selfish after using him as a financial crutch. Others might say she's in her right to end a relationship where her feelings aren't mutual. The fact that she was in a better position now could mean she's making a choice for her own needs. However, the financial aspect complicates things. If she was relying on him and then left once she became independent, it might be seen as inconsiderate. But if she was never in love and the relationship was emotionally one-sided, ending it is justified.\n\nI need to balance the emotional and financial factors. The woman says she doesn't love him, which is a valid reason to end a relationship. However, relying on someone financially and then leaving when you no longer need it could be seen as exploitative. The age difference and his Asperger's might make him less able to understand the situation, which adds to the moral weight. But she did try to console him and move out. \n\nIn conclusion, whether she's in the wrong depends on perspective. If she ended the relationship because she realized her feelings weren't mutual, even if it was after financial dependency, it might be justified. However, the way she used his financial support during her instability could be a point against her. The key is whether she acted selfishly or made a necessary decision for her own happiness. The answer could go either way, but I need to pick A or B based on the analysis.\n"
