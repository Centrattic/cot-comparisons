We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's 29, broke up with her boyfriend Justin, 20, after getting a good job. They had been dating over a year, and she was cleaning apartments, including his. Justin has Asperger's, and he started off awkward but became a good partner. He bought her things, helped her move in, and she was living with him. She lost her job and had to take a lower-paying one, so she relied on him financially. Then she got a better job, saved money, broke up with him, and now he's devastated.\n\nThe key points here are the age difference, the financial dependency, and the sudden breakup after she became more financially stable. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA). \n\nFirst, the age gap is significant: 29 vs. 20. That's almost a decade. That might indicate a power dynamic, especially since she was financially dependent on him for a while. But then she became financially stable and decided to leave. \n\nJustin has Asperger's, which might affect how he handles relationships. He might struggle with emotional transitions or rejection, which could explain why he's devastated and angry. The author mentions she tried to console him, suggested friends with benefits, but that made him angry. \n\nWas she in a relationship where she was using him financially? She moved in with him, took his virginity, and relied on his support. Then, once she got a better job, she left. That could be seen as emotionally manipulative or using him until she could be self-sufficient. However, she might argue that she didn't know how she felt about him and only realized she wasn't in love. \n\nBut the fact that she was using him financially and then left after gaining stability might be the issue. Also, the power imbalance because of the age and financial dependency could be exploitative. She might have a right to leave if she's not in love, but the way she left and the circumstances might make her the asshole. \n\nAlternatively, if she was in a relationship and later got her independence, it's her choice to leave, but she should have considered Justin's feelings more. Since he has Asperger's, maybe she should have been more understanding. But she did try to console him, so maybe she's not entirely wrong. \n\nHmm. On one hand, she's not obligated to stay in a relationship where she doesn't feel love. On the other, she might have taken advantage of his situation and then left when it suited her. The financial dependency is a big factor here. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because she was financially dependent on him, which could have created an unequal dynamic, and leaving after becoming financially stable might be seen as using him. Even if she didn't love him, the way she handled the breakup and the financial aspect might make her the asshole.\n"
