We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup after getting a good job. The author is 29, and her ex is 20, named Justin. They were dating over a year, met when she was cleaning his apartment. She mentions she was in a low-income situation, moved in with him after losing a job, and he was somewhat supporting her. She didn't love him as much as he loved her, but she broke up after getting a better job.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. She was in a relationship where there was an age gap (9 years), economic disparity, and dependency. She moved in with him partly because her apartment was bad and she lost her job. He was buying her things, which could be seen as generous but maybe also a way to maintain the relationship. She didn't love him but he had feelings for her. Then she got a good job, became more financially stable, and decided to break up. Now she's feeling guilty.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, both parties should have mutual feelings. She states she doesn't love him, which is a valid reason to end a relationship. However, the timing and context might matter. She broke up when she became more stable, which could be seen as using him for support. But she didn't know she'd get the job when they started. She tried to transition to friends with benefits, which he rejected. Also, considering age difference, Justin might be less experienced. Her actions could be self-preservation, moving on when she can. But was she honest about her feelings from the start? She mentions she was going to tell him it was casual but he started loving her. That might mean she didn't set boundaries early, leading to his attachment. So maybe she's partially at fault for not being clear. But breaking up because of lack of love isn't wrong. The community might see it as she's not the asshole because she's leaving a situation where the feelings aren't mutual. However, some might argue she should have been honest earlier. The answer depends on whether prioritizing one's own feelings and future is justified. Since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer might be B (no), because it's her right to leave an unreciprocated relationship, especially after gaining independence. But if she knew she didn't love him and stayed, that's different. She didn't love him, so ending it isn't the wrong choice.\n"
