We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author is 29, her ex is 20 with Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. He started buying her things, she moved in with him, and they had a sexual relationship. She didn't love him but was using him financially. Then she got a good job, saved money, broke up with him, and moved out. Now she's feeling bad but the question is whether she's the asshole.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, she was in a relationship where she wasn't in love but relied on him financially. When she got a better job, she felt the need to leave, maybe because she didn't want to be in a relationship where she was using him or because she felt she didn't need him anymore. But the ex was devastated, and she tried to console him, which might show she had some care for his feelings, but then she also suggested friends with benefits, which he rejected. \n\nThe main issue here is whether it's wrong to break up with someone when you're no longer in love, even if it's for financial reasons or personal growth. The author didn't hide the fact that she wasn't in love. She moved in with him because of her living conditions, which were poor. Then when her job improved her financial situation, she left. \n\nI need to consider if there were any manipulative behaviors. She didn't seem to be intentionally leading him on, but she was in a relationship where she wasn't in love. The fact that she was using him financially could be a point against her, but she also moved in with him because her apartment was bad. Maybe she didn't realize the dynamic was one-sided. \n\nThe ex is 20 and has Asperger's, which might affect how he processes relationships and emotional connections. He might have been more invested than she was. But the author had the right to end the relationship if she wasn't in love. The question is whether that's being an asshole. \n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, people are often called out for being inconsiderate or manipulative. The author tried to be supportive after the breakup, and even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he didn't accept. She did end the relationship when she felt it was right for her. \n\nThe key is whether the breakup was justified. Since she wasn't in love and was using him financially, once she became financially independent, it's reasonable to leave. The wrong would be if she stayed in the relationship knowing she wasn't in love and wasn't honest. But the author did break up with him after getting the job, which shows she had the opportunity to make her own decisions. \n\nSo the answer is B, No. The author isn't in the wrong because she ended the relationship when she felt it was necessary for her own situation and growth.\n"
