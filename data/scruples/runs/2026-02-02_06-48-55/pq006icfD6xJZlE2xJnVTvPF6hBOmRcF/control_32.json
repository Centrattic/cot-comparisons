We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who is 29, had a boyfriend named Justin, who is 20 and has Asperger's. They were dating for a year. The author was in a low-income situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning Justin's apartment. Justin lives in a luxury condo because of gentrification. They started a relationship, Justin was generous, bought her things, she moved in with him after losing her job. She didn't love him but he loved her. She got a good job, saved money, and broke up with him. Now Justin is upset, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the age difference is significant: 29 vs. 20. Depending on the jurisdiction, there might be issues with the relationship if Justin was a minor. If Justin was 20, depending on the country, that could be under the age of consent in some places. But maybe the user is in a place where 20 is the legal age. I should check if that's a factor here. If Justin was 20, and the age of consent is 18, then it's okay. But if it's higher, maybe there's an issue. However, the user didn't mention any legal issues, so maybe the age isn't the main problem here.\n\nNext, the author was in a financial situation where she relied on Justin for support because she lost her job. She mentions that Justin was kind of her \"meal ticket.\" That might imply that she was dependent on him financially, which could be a point of concern. But then she got a good job and became independent, which allowed her to save money. So, she broke up because she was no longer financially dependent and didn't love him. \n\nShe didn't love him but he was in love with her. She kept the relationship going even though she wasn't in love. That's a problem because it's not reciprocal. The fact that Justin has Asperger's might make him more vulnerable, especially if he's younger and perhaps less emotionally mature. The author might have taken advantage of his condition to some extent, using his generosity and support while she was in a tough spot.\n\nBut when she got a good job, she decided to end the relationship. Breaking up because you no longer need the person financially and you don't love them isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way she handled it might be questionable. She tried to console him but he was devastated. She offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he refused. So, maybe she's taking responsibility for his emotional state but still went through with the breakup.\n\nThe key points here are: non-reciprocal affection, financial dependency, and then breaking up when she's able to be independent. The question is whether her actions are justified. From a moral standpoint, if she was in an emotionally one-sided relationship where she wasn't in love, and then she decides to leave when she's financially stable, that's reasonable. However, if there was manipulation or taking advantage of Justin's condition or youth, that could make her the asshole.\n\nBut the user says she didn't love him and that she broke up when she could support herself. That seems fair. But the fact that she stayed with him for a year without loving him might have been emotionally harmful to Justin, who was in love. So, the question is whether it's wrong to stay in a relationship without love for a period of time, using someone's resources, and then leave when you get a better opportunity.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is important. If she didn't love him, maybe she should have been honest from the start. But she did eventually break up when she could, showing she had some consideration. So, maybe she's not the asshole. But the fact that she stayed in the relationship when her feelings weren't mutual and then left might be seen as selfish. However, the answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific circumstances. Since she didn't lie about her feelings initially but realized they weren't mutual over time, maybe it's not her fault. Alternatively, if she knew from the start she wasn't in love, that's different.\n\nThe user also mentions that Justin was generous, buying her things and supporting her. If she was taking advantage of his generosity without returning love, that's a problem. But if she was in a tough spot and he helped her, then she got a job and left when she could, it's a matter of self-responsibility. So, perhaps she's not in the wrong because she's taking control of her life and independence, even though it's hard to leave the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, factors to consider: non-reciprocal affection, financial dependency, age difference, and the handling of the breakup. If she was honest about her feelings and left when she could, maybe she's not the asshole. But if she stayed in a fake relationship for a long time, that's more questionable. The user's reasoning seems to be that she broke up when she could be independent, which is reasonable. So, the answer might be B (not the asshole).\n"
