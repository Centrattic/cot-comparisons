We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's 29, was dating Justin, who's 20 and has Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. Justin was buying her things, and she moved in with him. She got a better job, saved money, and then broke up with him because she doesn't love him as much. Now she's feeling bad but also moved out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if she had a responsibility to stay in the relationship. She mentioned it wasn't love on her side but she was using him for financial support. Breaking up when you're not in love isn't inherently wrong. However, Justin might have had deeper feelings. She tried to console him and suggested friends with benefits, which he rejected. Maybe she should have been more upfront about her intentions from the start. If she knew it wasn't a serious relationship, maybe she should have clarified that earlier. Also, moving in together when she didn't love him could be seen as taking advantage. But since she eventually broke up, maybe she's not in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. The key points are her lack of genuine feelings and using him financially, but she did break up once she had the means to be independent. So, maybe she's not the asshole.\n"
