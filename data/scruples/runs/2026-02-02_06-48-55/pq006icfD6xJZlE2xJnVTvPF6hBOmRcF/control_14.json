We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The question is presented as an \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 29, their ex-boyfriend Justin is 20 and has Asperger's. They met when the author was cleaning his apartment. The author was in a lower-income situation, moving in with Justin, who provided financial support. The author didn't love Justin but was in a relationship. Then the author got a better job, saved money, and broke up with Justin. Justin is upset, and the author feels bad but thinks they did the right thing.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to analyze the key points here. Relationships should be based on mutual respect and consent. The author seems to have been in a situation where they were financially dependent on Justin initially. Then, with a better job, they became independent and decided to end the relationship. \n\nIs it wrong to leave a relationship when you no longer want to be in it? Generally, no. People have the right to end relationships for any reason, especially if they don't have feelings for the other person. The author was honest about their feelings, tried to be consoling, and even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement. Justin's reaction is his own responsibility. \n\nHowever, there's the aspect of the power dynamic. The author was financially dependent on Justin and later became independent. Some might argue that ending the relationship after becoming independent could be seen as using Justin as a means of support. But the story doesn't suggest manipulation or deceit. The author moved in with Justin willingly and didn't hide their intentions. They also tried to maintain some connection post-breakup, which shows consideration.\n\nAnother angle is Justin's age and Asperger's. He might have difficulty understanding social cues or emotional complexities. The author might have known this and still proceeded with the breakup. However, the situation seems to have been a mutual, albeit uneven, relationship. The author isn't exploiting Justin in an ongoing way; they ended it when they felt ready.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They left a relationship where they weren't in love and became independent. It's their choice to end things, even if it's hard for the other person. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
