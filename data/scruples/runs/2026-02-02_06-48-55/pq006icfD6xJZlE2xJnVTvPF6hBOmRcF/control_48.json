We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who's 29, broke up with her 20-year-old boyfriend Justin after getting a good job. They met when she was cleaning his apartment, and he had Aspergers. They started a relationship, moved in together, and she ended up relying on him financially because her job situation was unstable. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him, which he's taking badly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The age difference is 9 years, which isn't huge, but Justin being 20 and the author 29 means he's still quite young. He also has Aspergers, which might affect how he handles emotional situations. They were dating for over a year, and the author moved in with him. She took his virginity and then didn't initially tell him it was casual, but he started buying her things and supporting her financially. She says she doesn't love him the way he does her. Then she gets a better job, becomes more financially independent, and breaks up.\n\nThe key points here are financial dependency, emotional attachment, and the decision to break up after gaining stability. She moved in with him because her apartment was bad, and he was her \"meal ticket\" when she lost her job. Now that she's financially stable, she leaves. The question is whether this is her fault.\n\nFrom one angle, she's making a choice to leave a relationship where she felt dependent and now has the means to be independent. She's honest about not loving him reciprocally. On the other hand, Justin was clearly investing emotionally and financially into the relationship. Breaking up might be hurtful, especially given his condition. The author tried to console him and suggested friends with benefits, but he was upset.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's choosing herself when she can now afford to do so, which is reasonable. She's honest about her feelings. However, the way she handled the breakup and her financial dependency might be a point of contention. But since she's not staying in a relationship where she's not in love, maybe she's justified. The community often considers it not an asshole if someone leaves when they're not in love, even if the other person is hurt. So the answer might be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
