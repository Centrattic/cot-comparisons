We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup after getting a better job. The author is 29, dating a 20-year-old named Justin. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. Justin has Asperger's, was awkward but nice. She had a casual relationship at first, but he started treating her well, she moved in with him. She didn't love him as much as he did. She lost her cleaning job and relied on him financially. Then she got a good job, saved up, and broke up. Now she's feeling bad.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, there's a significant age difference. Justin is 20, which is still young, and the author is 29. That might be a red flag, but maybe not necessarily a problem. Then, she was in a situation where she was financially dependent on Justin. If she had a casual relationship, but he started treating her like a partner, maybe there's some confusion. She didn't love him, but he was investing emotionally and financially. She broke up when she became financially stable. \n\nIs it okay to leave someone when you're no longer in a dependent position? Well, the main issue here is whether there was an expectation of a long-term relationship. If she was clear it was casual, maybe. But she moved in with him, accepted his support, and then left when her situation improved. That could be seen as using him, especially since he's young and may not have realized she didn't love him. However, she's not in a position to be in a relationship if she's not in love. \n\nThe other side is that she's improving her life, and leaving when she's financially stable isn't necessarily wrong. People can change their minds about relationships. But the fact that she relied on him financially and then left might make some think she's using him. However, she did try to console him and offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. \n\nThe key points: She didn't love him, was in a financial situation that made her dependent, then became independent and chose to leave. There's no indication of coercion or manipulation. She's being honest, even if it's hard. So, is she in the wrong? If there was an unspoken agreement that he was supporting her in exchange for a relationship, and she left after becoming financially stable, maybe. But if the relationship was never solid and she was clear about her feelings, then no. \n\nAlso, considering his Asperger's, maybe he had difficulty understanding her lack of commitment. But she should have been clear from the start. The fact that she moved in with him and accepted his support might imply a more committed relationship, but if she never intended to be in a real relationship, that's a problem. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong) because she led him on, used his support, and then left when it suited her. Or B (not in the wrong) because she's not obligated to stay in an unhappy relationship. It's a bit of a toss-up. But since she was honest in the end and broke up when she could support herself, maybe B is the answer. But the fact that she relied on him financially and didn't have feelings might tip it towards A. Hmm.\n"
