We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for breaking up with their boyfriend after getting a better job. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is 29, and Justin is 20. They dated over a year. She was in a rough financial spot, taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. She mentions moving in with him after losing her job, and he provided her with groceries, clothes, etc. She didn't love him but was using him, maybe? Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up, causing him distress.\n\nThe key points here are the age difference, the financial dependency, and the emotional dynamics. Justin is much younger, which might make the relationship unequal. She moved in with him because her apartment was bad and she lost her job. He was providing for her financially, which could create a power imbalance. She admits she didn't love him as much as he loved her, which is a red flag. When she got a better job, she left, which might be seen as using him for financial support until she could become stable. \n\nBut then there's the other side: people can choose to leave relationships if they feel they're not right. She might have felt trapped in a relationship where she wasn't emotionally invested. However, moving in with him and relying on him financially while not reciprocating love could be seen as taking advantage. The fact that she tried to console him but he was devastated adds to the emotional impact. \n\nThe question is whether breaking up was justified. Some might argue she was in the right to leave a relationship that wasn't mutually loving, especially when she gained financial stability. Others might say she was using him and then leaving when she no longer needed him. The age difference also plays a role in the dynamic. \n\nIn terms of the \"asshole\" aspect, it's more about intent and fairness. If she was honest about her feelings from the start and left when things changed, maybe not. But if she led him on or didn't consider his feelings, she might be at fault. The fact that she tried to befriend him post-breakup but he was angry complicates things. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer might lean towards her being in the right because she had the right to leave an unhealthy or unbalanced relationship. However, the way she handled it and the power dynamics could be points of criticism. But ultimately, ending a relationship where you don't feel the same love isn't inherently wrong. So maybe answer B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
