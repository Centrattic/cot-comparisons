We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that she broke up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. Let me consider the details.\n\nFirst, their age difference: she's 29, he's 20. That's a nine-year gap. He has Asperger's, which might affect how he handles relationships. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. He was her financial support, buying her stuff and she moved in with him. But she didn't love him the way he loved her. She got a good job, saved money, and broke up with him. Now he's upset, and she's feeling guilty.\n\nSo, the key points here. Was the relationship built on a solid foundation? She mentions they started as a casual relationship, but he wanted more. She took his virginity, but intended to keep it casual. However, he started buying her things and she moved in with him. That suggests he had deeper feelings, but she didn't. So maybe she led him on? If she never communicated that it was only casual, then maybe she's at fault. \n\nFinancial dependency is another angle. She relied on him financially, but once she got a better job, she broke up. That could seem like she left when she could support herself. But is it wrong to pursue financial stability? Not inherently. However, if she didn't address the relationship's status or his feelings, that's a problem. \n\nHe has Asperger's, which might make him less able to understand social cues or the relationship's nature. If she didn't clearly set boundaries, he might not have realized it was only casual. That could mean she didn't communicate clearly, leading to his emotional distress. \n\nHer breaking up after getting a better job might be seen as self-serving, but people do prioritize their goals. However, the way she ended things\u2014saying they could be friends with benefits, which upset him\u2014might indicate poor communication. \n\nIn summary, if she didn't properly set expectations and then left when she didn't need him financially, that could be seen as using him, making her the asshole. Alternatively, if the relationship was never serious and she ended it when things changed, maybe not. But since he was investing emotionally and she didn't reciprocate, her lack of communication might make her responsible.\n"
