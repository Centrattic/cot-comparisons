We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user wants to know if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is 29, and Justin is 20 with Asperger's. They were in a relationship for over a year. The author was struggling financially and worked odd jobs, including cleaning Justin's apartment. The dynamic here seems a bit complex because there's a significant age gap and the author was relying on Justin financially after losing a job. That might be a red flag. Justin's family is upper class, so he could afford to support her.\n\nShe mentions that she didn't love him the way he loved her. That's a key point. If a relationship is built on one-sided affection, it might not be sustainable. But then, she took a better job, saved money, and decided to break up. She tried to stay friends with benefits, which Justin rejected. Now she's feeling bad but also justifying it by saying she didn't love him.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. In relationships, honesty about feelings is important. If she never communicated her lack of love and instead let Justin believe there was a future, that's unethical. However, she did move in with him, which implies a level of commitment. But since she was in a position where she was financially dependent, that might have added pressure. On the flip side, once she's financially stable, ending the relationship for emotional reasons is her right, but the way she handled it matters. \n\nThe age difference and the potential power imbalance (financial support) could also be factors. Justin's Asperger's might affect his ability to read emotional cues, so if the author didn't clearly express her feelings, he might have been more vulnerable. She should have been honest from the start if it was strictly casual. But since they had a relationship, including moving in together, and she ended it after gaining financial stability, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nHowever, breaking up when you're no longer in a vulnerable position and being honest about not loving him is better than staying for material reasons. The problem is the communication. If she led him on or didn't make her intentions clear, that's an issue. But the post says she was going to tell him it's casual, but he started to like her, and then she stayed. So maybe she didn't communicate clearly. Now, after building up savings, she ends it. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the author's actions might be seen as using Justin for financial support, then leaving when she no longer needed it. But if she was honest about her feelings, she's not in the wrong. The key here is whether she was upfront. The post says she didn't love him, but she didn't specify if she told Justin that earlier. If she didn't, then she might be at fault. But once she's in a better position and ends the relationship, that's not necessarily wrong. \n\nSo the answer probably depends on whether the relationship was based on honesty. If she was dishonest about her feelings and financial dependency, then she's the asshole. But if she was truthful and ended it after becoming independent, it's not her fault. The story says she tried to console him and offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which might not be what he wanted. \n\nI think the consensus would be that she's not in the wrong because she ended the relationship when she was no longer in a difficult spot and was honest about her feelings, even if it was a bit late. However, there's a chance some might say she should have been clearer earlier. But since the question is whether she's in the wrong now, and considering the circumstances, I'll go with B.\n"
