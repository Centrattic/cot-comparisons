We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that she broke up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. He's 20, she's 29. They were dating over a year, he provided her with financial support because she was struggling. She moved in with him, and when she got a better job, she broke up. He's devastated.\n\nSo the core issue here is whether breaking up for financial security makes her the asshole. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, she might feel that she needed to move on because she was relying on him financially, and now that she's stable, she doesn't need the relationship anymore. But on the other hand, breaking up suddenly after a year-long relationship, especially when he's young and has Asperger's, could be seen as insensitive.\n\nThe author mentions that she didn't love him as much as he loved her. That's a common reason for breakups. However, she used his financial support to move in with him and then left when she could afford her own place. The question is whether her decision was selfish. She tried to console him, but he was hurt. The fact that she offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement and he was angry might indicate that he wanted more commitment.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people have the right to pursue their happiness and financial stability. But the way she ended the relationship might be seen as callous. However, if the relationship was already strained because she didn't love him, then maybe she's justified. The key points are her lack of love and the suddenness of the breakup after relying on him. It's possible she's not in the wrong because she's prioritizing her own well-being, but others might see it as using him and then leaving. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal values. In some views, breaking up when you find better circumstances isn't wrong. In others, the emotional impact on him is a concern. Since the user thinks she's in the wrong, but I need to decide. Maybe she's not entirely wrong because relationships require mutual feelings, but the way she handled it could be better. However, in AITA scenarios, people often look at intent. If she's honest about not loving him and leaves when she can, some might side with her. But others might say she should've been honest earlier. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because she's choosing her own happiness and the relationship wasn't based on mutual love.\n"
