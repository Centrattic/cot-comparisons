We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 29, and her ex is 20 with Asperger's. They had been dating over a year. She was in a low-income situation, taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. He started buying her things, and she moved in with him. She mentions she didn't love him as he did, and after getting a better job, she broke up with him. Now he's upset, and she feels bad.\n\nSo, the key points here are the age difference, the financial dependency, and the emotional imbalance. The author was taking care of her basic needs through Justin's support, but she didn't love him. When she got a better job, she chose to leave. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, relationships should be based on mutual love and respect. If she wasn't in love with him, maybe the relationship was one-sided from the start. However, he was dependent on her for financial support, and she moved out, leaving him. But she did try to console him and even suggested staying friends with benefits, which he rejected. \n\nThe main issue is whether it's wrong to leave a relationship when you're not in love, especially if there's an imbalance in contributions. She might have used him for financial stability, but she wasn't in love, which is a valid reason to break up. Also, considering his age and Asperger's, he might have a harder time moving on. However, she's not obligated to stay in a relationship she's not happy in. \n\nOn the other hand, if she was aware of his feelings and his dependency, she should have handled the breakup with more care. But overall, the decision to leave because of lack of love isn't inherently wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there are nuances. The key is that she wasn't in love, and relationships require mutual affection. So, she's not the asshole.\n"
