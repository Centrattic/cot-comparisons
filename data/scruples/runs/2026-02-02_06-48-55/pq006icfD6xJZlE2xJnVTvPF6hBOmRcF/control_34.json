We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. The situation involves a significant age gap: the author is 29, and Justin is 20. They had been dating over a year. The author was in a lower-income situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning apartments. She met Justin through that job, and he had Asperger's. They started a relationship, and the author ended up moving in with him after losing her job, relying on him financially. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him because she didn't love him as much as he loved her. Justin was devastated, and the author feels bad but moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the breakup was justified. The author admits she didn't love him as he did her. That's a key point. In relationships, mutual affection is important. If one person isn't committed, ending it can be reasonable. Also, the financial dependency might have been an issue. She was relying on him financially before getting the better job. Now that she's more stable, she can leave without financial strain. Justin's reaction is mentioned, but he's 20, so maybe he's not handling the breakup well. The author tried to console him and even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. That shows she tried to mitigate the situation.\n\nAge gap can affect dynamics too. A 20-year-old might still be in a different life stage compared to a 29-year-old. The author might be seeking more stability or a partner with similar life goals. Since she's in a better position now, leaving to pursue her own life isn't necessarily wrong. However, there's a question of whether she manipulated the situation, but the story doesn't suggest that. She seems honest about her feelings. The fact that she tried to be nice about the breakup suggests she's trying to be considerate.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that she used Justin as a \"meal ticket,\" but she mentions moving in with him before the job change. Maybe she was planning to leave all along. But the main reason given is lack of love. In most ethical frameworks, not being in love isn't a moral failing if the person is honest. The author isn't hiding her feelings; she just realizes she doesn't have the same level of affection. So, breaking up to pursue her own happiness isn't wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
