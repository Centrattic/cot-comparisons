We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a boyfriend after getting a better job. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the woman is 29, her ex is 20 and has Asperger's. They were dating over a year. She was in a low-income situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. She met him through that job. He was nice but awkward. They had sex, he started buying her things, and she moved in with him because her apartment was bad. She lost her job then got a lower-paying one, so he was supporting her financially. She doesn't love him, but he loves her. She recently got a good job, saved money, broke up with him. He's devastated, she tried to console him and suggested friends with benefits, which he didn't like. She moved out, feels bad.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. She was in a financially unstable situation, relying on him for support. But when she got a better job, she became more stable. She realized she didn't love him, so she ended the relationship. She tried to be kind, offered to stay as friends with benefits, but he rejected that. \n\nIs it wrong to leave a relationship when you don't have feelings anymore? Generally, no. People can't force themselves into a relationship without love. But there's also the aspect of her relying on him financially. Moving in with someone and then leaving after becoming financially stable might be seen as using him, but she didn't intend to. She did love him as a partner, just not romantically. \n\nHer actions: she ended the relationship for her own reasons. She tried to help him move on. The community might judge based on the age gap and financial dependency. But legally and ethically, if she isn't lying or manipulating, she's not the asshole. People have the right to end relationships they're not committed to. \n\nPossible counterarguments: exploiting his Asperger's to keep him in a relationship, or taking advantage of his kindness. But the story doesn't suggest manipulation. She felt guilty and tried to be supportive. So, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
