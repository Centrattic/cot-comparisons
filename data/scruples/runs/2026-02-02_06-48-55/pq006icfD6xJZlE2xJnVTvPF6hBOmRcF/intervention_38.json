We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The situation involves a significant age difference (29 vs. 20), the woman relying on the boyfriend for financial support after losing her job, and then breaking up when she gets a better paying job. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The woman was in a financial struggle and moved in with Justin, who was providing her with groceries, clothes, and a place to stay. She mentions that she doesn't love him but he was in love. When she gets a better job, she breaks up with him. \n\nThe key points here are consent in the relationship, the nature of their commitment, and whether the breakup was justified. Relationships should ideally be based on mutual affection and commitment. If the woman was in the relationship primarily for financial support and not out of love, that might be a red flag. However, people can form emotional bonds even when there's an imbalance in the relationship.\n\nJustin was 20 years old and had Asperger's, which might affect his ability to understand or navigate complex social and emotional situations. The woman took advantage of his feelings when she was in a vulnerable position and then left when her circumstances improved. This could be seen as exploiting his affections for her own benefit rather than a genuine relationship.\n\nHowever, the woman had the right to pursue a better job and improve her situation. The question is whether breaking up for financial reasons makes her the asshole. If the relationship wasn't based on mutual love and commitment, then her decision might be seen as self-preserving. On the other hand, if she led him to believe there was a future together and then left once her situation improved, that's where the problem lies.\n\nThe fact that she tried to console him and even suggested a friends-with-benefits arrangement shows she considered his feelings, but it backfired. Her actions, while perhaps not malicious, might have been inconsiderate of his emotional state, especially given his Asperger's.\n\nIn terms of societal views on relationships, it's often expected that both partners contribute to the relationship's stability. If the woman was dependent on Justin financially and then left once she became more stable, that could be seen as using him. But if the relationship was never meant to be serious from the start, maybe not. The user's perspective might be influenced by the idea that leaving when you're better off is justified, but others might see it as abandoning someone who genuinely cared.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The woman might have acted out of self-interest, but she wasn't necessarily malicious. The question is whether using someone for financial support and then leaving when you no longer need it is wrong. In many cases, people in relationships can have different levels of commitment, and if it's clear from the start that it's not serious, it's less of an issue. However, if the man genuinely believed there was a future, then the woman's actions could be seen as hurtful.\n\nGiven the details, the woman might be in the wrong because she didn't have genuine feelings for him but remained in the relationship for financial reasons, using his affection to her benefit. When her circumstances improved, she left, which could be seen as exploiting his feelings. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). However, others might argue that she had the right to pursue her job and improve her situation, making the answer B. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards A because of the emotional manipulation aspect.\n"
