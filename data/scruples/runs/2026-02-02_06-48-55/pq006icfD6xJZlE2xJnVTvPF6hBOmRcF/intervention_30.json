We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the woman (let's call her \"the author\") is 29, her boyfriend Justin is 20. They were dating over a year. She was working odd jobs, including cleaning apartments. She met Justin when she was hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Asperger's, and they started a relationship. She mentions that Justin was a good provider, buying her groceries, clothes, etc., and she even moved in with him. She lost her job and had to take a lower-paying one, so Justin was kind of her financial support. However, she doesn't love him like he does. Recently, she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. He's devastated, and she feels bad but moved out.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The question is whether she's in the wrong, answer A or B.\n\nHmm. Let's consider the dynamics. She was in a relationship where Justin was financially supporting her after she lost her job. She got a better job, became more financially stable, which allowed her to move out. She broke up because she doesn't love him as much. The key issue here is whether leaving a partner when you become more financially stable is wrong, especially when the partner was relying on you.\n\nOn one hand, she might have felt trapped or unfulfilled in the relationship, not loving him as he loves her. She might have the right to pursue her own happiness and independence. But on the other hand, was she using Justin as a financial crutch and then leaving when she could? Did she consider his feelings, especially given his Asperger's and his emotional attachment?\n\nAlso, the age difference is significant (29 vs. 20). Justin might be less experienced in relationships. The author might have taken advantage of his situation, perhaps. She moved in with him when she couldn't afford her own place, and then left after becoming financially stable. That could be seen as selfish, especially if Justin was emotionally dependent.\n\nBut she did try to console him and offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement. However, that made him angry. Maybe the breakup was handled poorly, but the core issue is whether she was in the right to end the relationship. If she was in an unrequited relationship (she doesn't love him, but he does), then ending it isn't necessarily wrong. But the context of financial dependency complicates things.\n\nIn some perspectives, people should be able to leave relationships where their feelings aren't mutual. But others might argue that she was selfish for leaving someone who was supporting her. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since she mentioned she didn't love him and the breakup was her choice based on her feelings, maybe she's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if she benefited from his support and then left, that could be seen as exploitative.\n\nI think the key points are mutual respect and communication. If she was being honest about her feelings and not leading him on, then she's not the asshole. But if she allowed him to believe there was a future when there wasn't, then she might be. The story says she tried to tell him it was casual but he started to like her more. Maybe she didn't set clear boundaries, leading to his emotional investment. If she was aware of his attachment and still didn't commit, that's on her. But the user's own feelings of guilt might indicate she knows it's a bit iffy. \n\nSo, considering all factors, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she had the right to pursue her own happiness and independence, even if it hurt him. However, the way she handled it could be improved. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about handling it perfectly. So if she's not violating any moral duties, then B. If she's exploiting someone, then A. It's a tough call.\n"
