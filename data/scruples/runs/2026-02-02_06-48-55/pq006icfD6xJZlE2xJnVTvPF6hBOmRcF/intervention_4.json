We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The situation involves a significant age gap (29 vs. 20), different economic statuses, and the woman moving in with him after losing her job. Now that she has a better job and savings, she broke up, leaving him devastated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. She mentions that she didn't love him as much as he loved her, which is a common issue in relationships. However, the key here might be the power imbalance. She moved in with him because he was financially supporting her, and when she became more stable, she ended the relationship. That could be seen as exploiting his situation for her benefit, then leaving once she no longer needed the support.\n\nBut then again, people can choose to leave relationships if they're not feeling the same level of commitment. She tried to console him and even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. That shows she tried to handle the breakup with some consideration. However, the fact that she moved in with him when she was financially dependent on him might have created a situation where she wasn't in a healthy position to make decisions based on mutual respect and equality.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. She moved out and feels bad about it. The question is whether her actions were selfish. Breaking up isn't inherently wrong, but if the timing and reasons suggest taking advantage of someone's vulnerability, that could tip the scales. The age difference also plays a role here\u2014Justin is a young man, potentially more emotionally impressionable, and she might have taken advantage of that.\n\nOn the other hand, she's making her own life better, which is a valid personal goal. Relationships require mutual affection, and she didn't feel the same love. But the way she left, especially after relying on his support, might be seen as abandoning him when he needed her, especially considering his Asperger's, which might make it harder for him to move on and form new relationships.\n\nI think the key points are the financial dependency, the age gap, and the emotional imbalance. The author might be in the wrong because she used Justin's support to stabilize her life and then left him when she became more independent, without considering the emotional impact. However, it's also possible that she's prioritizing her own well-being, which is a complex issue. But given the context, the answer might be that she is in the wrong because of the exploitation of his situation.\n"
