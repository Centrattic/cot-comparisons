We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with her boyfriend after getting a good job is in the wrong. The scenario has a lot of elements to consider.\n\nFirst, the age difference: she's 29, he's 20. That's a significant gap. Justin might be young and possibly not fully mature yet, especially considering he has Asperger's. He might be more emotionally dependent on her. She mentions that she was his meal ticket, and he provided her with a place to live and other things. There's a power dynamic here where he was financially supporting her, but now she has a better job and is more stable.\n\nThe relationship started through a workplace context, which can be a red flag. She took his virginity early on, and he became very attached. She didn't set clear boundaries, maybe expecting a casual relationship but ended up in something more. When she left, she tried to be kind, but he was devastated. She's feeling guilty now. \n\nThe main question is whether she's at fault. The key points are: Did she take advantage of him? Did she not communicate her intentions? She didn't love him but stayed because of his support. When she became financially independent, she ended the relationship. That's a common situation where someone uses a partner's resources until they can stand on their own. But does that make her a bad person?\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and clear communication are important. If she knew from the start it was going to be casual but he wanted more, that's an issue. However, she mentions she was going to tell him it's casual but he started to like her more. So maybe she didn't set clear boundaries early on, leading to his emotional investment. Once she left, she tried to console him, which shows she cares about his feelings.\n\nBut the core issue is whether ending the relationship for personal growth is wrong. In many cases, people move on when their circumstances change. However, the way she handled it and the power imbalance might affect the judgment. If she was using him for financial support and then left, that could be seen as selfish. However, she did care enough to help him find someone else and tried to be a friend.\n\nConsidering all that, it's a tough call. But since she ended the relationship when she felt she no longer needed to be in it, and there's no indication she was abusive or deceitful, maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No). But the fact that she didn't love him and stayed for his support could be seen as using him, which might make her the asshole. Hmm. Need to weigh both sides.\n"
