We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole in this situation. The question is whether breaking up with the boyfriend after getting a good job makes the author in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author, 29, was in a year-long relationship with Justin, 20, who has Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. Justin was buying her things, she moved in with him, and then she lost her job. She relied on him financially. Now she got a better job and broke up with him. Justin is upset and the author feels bad.\n\nSo, is she wrong? Well, relationships can be complex, but the key points here are the age difference, the financial dependency, and the emotional dynamics. The author moved in with Justin partly because her own living situation was bad. Justin provided financial support when she was unemployed. Then she got a good job, became more financially stable, and ended the relationship. \n\nThe author might argue that she wasn't in love and that Justin was emotionally invested but she wasn't. Breaking up because of personal growth and better circumstances isn't inherently wrong. However, the way the breakup was handled could matter. She tried to console him and even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. But Justin being 20 and the author being 29 might point to an imbalance in maturity or life stages. Justin might not have been ready for a long-term commitment, especially if he's still young and dealing with Asperger's.\n\nThe user might be wondering if financial dependency affects the moral responsibility. Maybe she should have considered how leaving would impact him, but she did try to stay in touch. The question of whether she's in the wrong depends on cultural views on relationships and personal responsibility. Some might say she's not wrong because she's prioritizing her own well-being and growth. Others might say she led him on if she didn't have feelings for him beyond physical. \n\nBut since she didn't force him into the relationship and tried to be supportive, maybe she's not the asshole. The fact that she ended the relationship when she felt it wasn't right for her, even though it was hard, could be seen as responsible. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
