We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 29-year-old woman who broke up with her 20-year-old boyfriend, Justin, after getting a good job. They had been dating over a year, and Justin had Asperger's. She was in a low-income situation, cleaned his apartment, and eventually moved in with him after losing her job. Justin provided her with financial support, but she didn't love him the way he loved her. She got a better job, saved money, and then broke up with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Justin is significantly younger and has a condition that affects social interactions. The woman was in a vulnerable financial situation, which might have influenced their relationship. Justin provided her with financial support, which could be a factor in their dynamic. The question is whether ending the relationship to pursue a better job and financial independence is wrong.\n\nThe woman's actions were to leave after securing a good job, implying that financial stability played a role in her decision. She tried to console him but he was upset. She offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, but he rejected it. The key points here are whether she was being selfish or was acting in her best interest. Since she was financially dependent on him and then achieved independence, it's possible she felt the relationship was no longer balanced. However, the age difference and his Asperger's might make him more vulnerable, so her leaving could be seen as taking advantage of his condition.\n\nOn the other hand, she didn't force him into the relationship. They were in a dating relationship where she was clear about her feelings not being mutual. If she was honest with him and he was still attached, maybe the responsibility isn't entirely on her. People can make choices based on their own happiness and future, even if it's hard for the other person. The question is whether her decision to leave for financial reasons is justified. \n\nIn terms of moral wrong, relationships require mutual love and commitment. If she didn't love him as he loved her, it's not fair to keep him in a one-sided situation. Gaining financial independence could be a valid reason to reassess the relationship. However, the way she handled the breakup might matter. She tried to console him and even offered a different arrangement, but he was hurt. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong because she's prioritizing her own well-being and future. Relationships should be based on mutual affection, and if she can't provide that, ending it isn't necessarily wrong. However, there's a concern about the power dynamic and his vulnerability. But since she didn't coerce him and was honest, maybe she's not the asshole. So the answer would be B, Not in the wrong.\n"
