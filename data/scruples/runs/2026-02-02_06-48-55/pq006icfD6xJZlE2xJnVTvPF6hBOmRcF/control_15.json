We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 29-year-old woman ending a relationship with a 20-year-old boyfriend after getting a better job. They had been dating over a year, and she moved in with him, relying on his financial support after losing her job. Now that she's stable, she's broken up with him, leading to his devastation.\n\nFirst, the age difference is significant\u2014nine years. While not illegal, it could affect the relationship dynamics, especially since Justin is 20 and still in a stage of life where relationships might be less serious. The author mentions that she didn't love him as he did, which is a key point. If the relationship was unequal in emotional commitment, ending it might be justified. However, she was using him financially for a while, which could be a point against her. \n\nShe broke up with him when her financial situation improved, which might look like she only stayed for his support. That's a classic TAL situation. Also, offering to be friends with benefits after the breakup might have been insensitive, especially if he was emotionally invested. However, she did feel bad and tried to console him, showing some empathy.\n\nThe main factors are: the imbalance in the relationship (her relying on his money), the age gap, and the reason for breaking up (her own stability rather than mutual issues). If she was in the relationship primarily for financial reasons and left when she no longer needed it, that's a red flag. On the other hand, if she was honest about her feelings and the relationship wasn't genuine, then it's more about her right to end an unhealthy or one-sided relationship.\n\nIn TAL scenarios, people are often considered assholes if they use others and then leave without considering the other person's feelings. Here, she did consider Justin's feelings (trying to console him, feeling bad), but the core issue is whether she was in the relationship for his money. If that's the case, then she's in the wrong. If the relationship was already one-sided and she ended it when she realized that, it's less clear. However, the fact that she's older and in a better position to make a responsible decision suggests she should have been more upfront about her intentions earlier. Breaking up after becoming financially stable could be seen as using him, which would make her the asshole.\n"
