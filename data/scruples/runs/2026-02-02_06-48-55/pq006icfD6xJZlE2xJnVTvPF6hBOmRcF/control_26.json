We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a 29-year-old woman who was in a relationship with Justin, a 20-year-old man with Asperger's syndrome. They had been dating over a year. The author was in a low-income situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning Justin's apartment. Justin lived in a luxury condo, and they met through her job. She ended up moving in with him after losing her job, relying on him financially for groceries and clothes. She didn't love him but he was nice and they had a sexual relationship. Now she got a better-paying job, built savings, and broke up with him, which left him devastated. The question is whether she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, the age difference is 9 years. While not extreme, Justin was 20 when they started. Some might question if a 20-year-old is emotionally mature enough for a long-term relationship, especially with someone 9 years older. Justin has Asperger's, which might affect his emotional understanding. The author mentions Justin was awkward but a sweetheart. He bought her things and provided a place to live. She moved in with him, suggesting a level of commitment. However, she states she didn't love him. That's a red flag because relationships usually require mutual affection. She used him financially when she lost her job and moved in. Now that she's stabilized with a good job, she broke up, leading to his distress.\n\nIs it wrong to break up when you realize you don't have feelings? If the relationship was based on convenience and financial dependency for her, maybe she's being inconsiderate. Justin might have seen it as a serious relationship, especially with her moving in. Breaking up after building up his hopes could be hurtful. However, she had the right to end a relationship she wasn't emotionally invested in. The key issue is whether she was honest early on. She mentions she was going to tell him it's casual but he started loving her. If she misrepresented the relationship's nature, that's a problem. Also, using someone financially when in a relationship can be exploitative. She benefited from his resources while he had feelings for her. Now breaking up after his emotional investment might make her the asshole. But if the relationship was never meant to be serious from her side, and she ended it when her circumstances changed, maybe not. The judgment here is tricky. She might have been inconsiderate, but she's also taking control of her life. However, the fact that she moved in with him and accepted his financial support while not being in love could be seen as taking advantage. So the answer might be A, she's in the wrong.\n"
