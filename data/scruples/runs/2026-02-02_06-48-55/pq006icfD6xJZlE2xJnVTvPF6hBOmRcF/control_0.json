We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. The situation involves a significant age difference (29 vs. 20), different financial statuses, and the author moving in with the boyfriend partly due to financial reasons.\n\nFirst, the relationship started when she was cleaning his apartment. He had Asperger's, which might affect his emotional processing. She mentions moving in because her apartment was poor quality and her job was unstable. He bought her things like groceries and a coat, which suggests he was supporting her financially. She then got a better job, saved money, and decided to break up. He's upset, and she's feeling bad about it.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. If she was in the relationship without feeling love and left when her circumstances improved, is that wrong? She moved in with him because she needed a better place, which is understandable. However, if she knew he was emotionally invested and she wasn't, ending the relationship when her financial situation improved could be seen as using him. But she did try to console him and offered a friends-with-benefits option, which he rejected.\n\nThe question is whether her decision is selfish. She wasn't in love, and relationships require mutual affection. But the power dynamic here is important. She was financially dependent on him, and when she became more stable, she left. That could be seen as exploiting his affection for her own benefit. However, staying in a relationship without reciprocal love is also not healthy. So there's a balance between her right to pursue her own happiness and the impact on him. \n\nIn terms of morality, relationships should be based on mutual respect and love. If she didn't feel the same, breaking up is her right. However, if she led him to believe more than she felt, that could be an issue. But she did try to comfort him, so maybe she communicated as best as she could. The answer hinges on whether her actions were deceitful or just a natural progression of her life. Since she didn't love him and felt the need to leave, it's not entirely her fault. But the financial dependency complicates things. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she's entitled to her own happiness, but there's a gray area. Alternatively, if the relationship was based on her financial need rather than genuine connection, ending it when she no longer needed support isn't wrong.\n"
