We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a breakup after getting a good job. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is 29, her ex Justin is 20. They dated over a year. She was in a low-income situation, taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. Justin, who has Asperger's, started buying her things, and she moved in with him. She was using his financial support, lost her job, then got a better job. She broke up with him, he's upset, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, possible angles: age difference (9 years), power dynamics (financial support), emotional imbalance. Justin's Asperger's might affect his understanding of relationships. She moved in with him because her own apartment was bad. She didn't love him but he loved her. She broke up when she became more financially stable. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she had a one-sided relationship where she was getting support but not loving him. When she became independent, she ended it. Is that fair? Maybe she should have been more honest from the start. But breaking up when you're no longer dependent isn't necessarily wrong. However, the fact that she's using his financial support while not being in love might be a red flag. Also, moving in with him because of her apartment situation\u2014maybe she took advantage of him. \n\nBut she did try to console him and offer a friends-with-benefits, which he rejected. So she's trying to make it right. The age gap might also be a factor, though not necessarily her fault. Justin's Asperger's could mean he's more vulnerable. She might have led him on by taking his support without reciprocal love. \n\nOn the other hand, he was buying her things, maybe he was the one in an unbalanced position. She was in a difficult financial situation, and she's improving her life. Breaking up because she's no longer dependent isn't inherently wrong. But maybe she should have been more honest about her feelings earlier instead of staying in a relationship where she wasn't in love. \n\nSo, is she the asshole? It's a bit of a gray area. But I think she's not in the wrong. She's taking control of her life, and while she could have handled the breakup more sensitively, ending a relationship when it's not working is acceptable. Justin's maturity level and his Asperger's might mean he wasn't fully aware of the dynamics. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's prioritizing her independence, even if the relationship was unequal.\n"
