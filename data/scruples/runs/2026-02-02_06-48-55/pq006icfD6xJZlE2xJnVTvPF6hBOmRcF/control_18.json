We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a 29-year-old woman breaking up with her 20-year-old boyfriend after getting a good job. They were together for over a year, met when she was cleaning his apartment. He had Asperger's, they had a casual relationship that turned into living together. She didn't love him but relied on his financial support. Now that she's financially stable, she broke up, and he's upset. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Age difference is 9 years, which might be a factor but not necessarily a problem. The key points are the relationship's nature. She mentions it was supposed to be casual but he developed feelings. He provided financial support, which could lead to an imbalance. She moved in with him, implying a certain level of commitment, but she didn't love him. When she became financially stable, she ended the relationship.\n\nIs it her fault? Well, if the relationship was based on her expecting financial support without mutual emotional commitment, maybe she led him on. But she said she didn't love him, so perhaps she wasn't in the wrong for not reciprocating feelings. However, ending things when her circumstances changed could be seen as using him. The question is whether she was honest about her intentions from the start. If she never intended a long-term relationship, then maybe she's at fault for not being upfront. On the other hand, if the relationship evolved beyond casual without her realizing, and she later decided she didn't want to be in it, that's different. But the fact that she moved in with him and accepted his support might imply a deeper commitment, so breaking up for financial reasons after that could be seen as selfish. But she might argue that she's prioritizing her own needs now that she can. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the relationship was built on a foundation of honesty about intentions. If she didn't clarify that it was purely physical or casual from the start, then she might be in the wrong. If he assumed more than she intended, she's responsible for that miscommunication. But if she clearly stated it was casual and he overstepped, then she's not. The story says she was going to tell him it was casual but he started to like her, so maybe she didn't set boundaries. That could mean she's partially responsible. However, the core issue is whether breaking up after financial stability is wrong. Since she's not in love, it's her right to end it, but the way she handled it might matter. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's choosing herself, but others might argue she was inconsiderate. The community on AITA often considers intent and communication. If she didn't set clear expectations, maybe A. But if the problem is her breaking up when she's financially secure, then B. Given the details, I think the answer is B because she's not obligated to stay in a relationship she's not in love with, even if it's convenient for her. The real issue might be the initial lack of clarity, but the decision to leave isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
