We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is she's 29, her ex boyfriend Justin is 20. They dated over a year. She was in a tough financial situation, doing odd jobs and cleaning apartments. She met Justin while cleaning his place. He has Asperger's, was awkward but sweet. They started dating, she took his virginity, and he started buying her things. She moved in with him when her job ended, so she was relying on him financially. She didn't love him as much as he loved her. Then she got a good job, saved money, broke up with him. He's upset, she offered to stay friends with benefits but he was angry. She moved out and feels bad.\n\nFirst, the age difference is 9 years. In some places, that's okay, but there might be a power dynamic here. She was financially dependent on him. Then she leaves when she becomes financially stable. That could be seen as using him when she was in need, then leaving when she's better off. But she didn't lie about her feelings initially. She thought it was casual but he got serious. She admitted she doesn't love him as he does. Breaking up when she's no longer dependent could be seen as honest, but maybe the way she ended it was harsh. She tried to console him and offered a different arrangement, but he was angry. Maybe he felt used. However, she didn't force him to be with her. She had the right to end the relationship when she felt it wasn't right. The key is whether she was transparent about her intentions from the start. If she led him on thinking it was more than it was, then she might be in the wrong. But the post says she intended to tell him it was casual but didn't because he became serious. So maybe she didn't set clear boundaries, leading to his attachment. However, she's honest now. Also, financial dependency can complicate relationships. If she was using him for money, that's a problem, but she moved in when her job ended, so maybe it was mutual support. The question is whether her leaving after securing her own stability is fair. She's not necessarily in the wrong if she's honest about her feelings. But if she encouraged a relationship without love, that's a gray area. The community might see it as she's not the asshole because she's being truthful and moved on, but others might argue she should have been clearer earlier. Considering the details, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's being honest and the relationship wasn't based on mutual love from the start. However, the financial aspect could make it more complex. But since she didn't lie after the fact and tried to explain, maybe B is the right choice.\n"
