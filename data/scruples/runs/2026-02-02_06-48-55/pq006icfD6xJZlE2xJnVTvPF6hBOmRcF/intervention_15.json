We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The situation involves a significant age difference (29 vs. 20), different socioeconomic statuses, and possible power imbalances.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship with Justin, who was 20 and had Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. He started buying her things, and she moved in with him. Then she lost her job and was reliant on him financially. Now, she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. She feels guilty but isn't sure if she was in the wrong.\n\nThe key points to consider are consent, power dynamics, and the nature of the relationship. When she was financially dependent on him, was the relationship balanced? Also, Justin's age and Asperger's might affect his ability to navigate relationships, especially with someone older and in a different socioeconomic position. The author may have taken advantage of Justin when she was in a vulnerable position. Even if she didn't love him, continuing the relationship for financial support and then leaving once she became independent could be seen as using him. However, she did try to be kind and offer a friends-with-benefits arrangement. \n\nOn the other hand, people can choose to end relationships for valid reasons. If she didn't love him, it's fair to end it. But the power dynamics here are important. The question is whether she exploited Justin during their time together. If the relationship was based on her financial need and his generosity, that's a red flag. Breaking up isn't inherently wrong, but the circumstances might make it so. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the relationship was manipulative or if she was genuinely in a position where she couldn't afford to stay. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but others might argue she had the right to leave. Considering the age gap and the financial dependency, I think the author might be in the wrong because she could have been taking advantage of Justin's situation when she was in need, and then leaving once her needs changed. That's not necessarily malicious, but it's still ethically questionable. So, the answer would be A.\n"
