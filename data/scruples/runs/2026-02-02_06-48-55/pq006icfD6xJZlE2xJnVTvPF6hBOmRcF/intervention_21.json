We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the setup: the woman is 29, her boyfriend Justin is 20. They were dating over a year. She was in a job cleaning apartments, which is where they met. Justin lives in a luxury condo, and she was in a poor area. She started cleaning his apartment, they had a relationship, he bought her things, she moved in with him. She didn't love him but he was devoted. Then she got a good job, saved money, broke up with him, and he's upset. She feels bad but is asking if she's the asshole.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's the case. The key points here are about the nature of their relationship. The author mentions she didn't love him but he was buying her things, supporting her, and she moved in with him. She broke up after getting a better job, possibly because she was able to be independent now. \n\nBut the question is whether she was in the wrong. From the story, she didn't love him but was in a relationship. That's a red flag. She took advantage of his feelings, maybe. She moved in with him, and when she could support herself, she ended the relationship. It's not clear if they were in a committed relationship or casual. The term \"friends with benefits\" was mentioned, but she tried to transition to that after breaking up, which he didn't like.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is important. If she didn't love him, maybe she should have been honest earlier. However, sometimes people realize their feelings change over time. The age gap is 9 years, which might not be huge, but Justin is young, 20, which is still young for a 29-year-old. Also, he has Asperger's, which might mean he has difficulty understanding social cues or forming relationships, making him more vulnerable.\n\nShe used him financially, perhaps. He supported her financially by buying groceries, clothes, etc. When she got a job and could support herself, she left. That could be seen as selfish. On the other hand, staying in a relationship where you don't love the person isn't healthy either. But the way she ended it, being honest and breaking up when she got a better opportunity might be justified. However, the fact that she didn't love him from the start but continued the relationship, leading him on, could make her the asshole.\n\nSo, considering all factors: she didn't love him but stayed with him, taking his support, then left when she could be independent. The ethical point is about honesty and not leading someone on. If she knew she didn't love him but continued the relationship, that's a problem. But if she developed feelings later or realized she couldn't love him, maybe it's different. The story says \"I just don\u2019t love him like he does,\" implying it was mutual from the start. So she was aware she didn't love him, used his support, and left when she could. That makes her the asshole. So answer A.\n"
