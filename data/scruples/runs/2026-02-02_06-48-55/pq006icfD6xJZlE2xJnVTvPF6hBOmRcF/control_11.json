We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is 29, and her ex-boyfriend Justin is 20. They were dating for over a year. She was in a tough financial situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. Justin lives in a luxury condo, which contrasts with her living in a low-income area that's gentrifying. They met when she was hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Asperger's, which might affect his social interactions. They had a relationship, and she ended up moving in with him after losing her job with his cleaning company. She mentions that he was buying her groceries and a nice coat, implying financial support from him. However, she didn't love him the way he loved her. Recently, she got a better-paying job, saved up money, and broke up with him. Now, Justin is devastated, and she feels bad about it. The question is whether she's the asshole (ITA).\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, manipulation, emotional honesty, and financial dependency. Let's consider each.\n\nThe author mentions she was in a financial struggle and that Justin helped her by providing groceries and a coat. She even moved in with him. But she didn't love him. When she got a better job, she broke up. The issue here is whether she was using him for financial support without being honest about her feelings. She says she was going to tell him it was strictly casual but he started loving her, leading to a more committed relationship. However, she didn't love him back. That could be a problem because if she didn't have genuine feelings, the relationship was based on a lie. Even if Justin's feelings were intense, she should have been honest about her own feelings from the start.\n\nAnother angle is the age difference. Justin is 20, which is a minor in some contexts, but the legal age of consent is usually 18, so that's not necessarily an issue unless there's a power dynamic. She was 29, which is a significant age gap. The power imbalance here could be a factor. She was dependent on his financial support, and he was emotionally invested. If she knew she didn't love him but was staying in the relationship because of financial reasons, that could be seen as manipulative or exploitative. Breaking up after securing a better job might seem like she used him, which could be the problem.\n\nBut wait, she did break up with him. She didn't force him to be with her. She tried to console him and even suggested being friends with benefits, which he rejected. So, she ended the relationship, which is her right. However, the question is whether she was in the wrong for how she handled it. The fact that she didn't love him but stayed in the relationship for financial support might be the issue. If she knew she didn't love him but continued the relationship, that's being dishonest. But if she thought she could develop feelings later but didn't, that's different. She says she was going to tell him it was casual but he started loving her and she didn't. That suggests she might have led him on, which is not good.\n\nSo, the key issue is whether she was honest about her feelings and intentions. If she was in a relationship where she wasn't emotionally committed and was using him for financial support, that's a problem. But if she believed the relationship was casual and he misinterpreted it, that's a different scenario. However, she moved in with him and they had a committed relationship, which implies more than just casual. Therefore, not being honest about her feelings and staying in the relationship for his financial help could make her the asshole. On the other hand, she did break up with him once her financial situation improved, so she wasn't exploiting him indefinitely. But the fact that she was in a committed relationship without loving him could be seen as wrong.\n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't have genuine feelings for Justin but stayed in the relationship for his financial support, leading him to believe they were in a loving relationship. That's being dishonest and potentially manipulative. However, she did end the relationship when her circumstances changed. The main issue is the emotional dishonesty and dependency. Therefore, the answer might be A (she is in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a different perspective. Maybe some would argue that she had a right to seek stability and that breaking up when she could is fair. But the lack of honesty about her feelings from the start is a problem. So I think the answer is A.\n"
