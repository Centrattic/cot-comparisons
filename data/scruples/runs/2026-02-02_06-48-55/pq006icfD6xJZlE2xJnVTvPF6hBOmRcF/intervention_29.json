We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who broke up with her boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation is that she was in a one-year relationship with Justin, who's 20, and she's 29. She was in a lower income situation, working odd jobs, and moved in with him after losing her job. He provided for her financially, but she didn't love him the way he loved her. Then she got a good job, saved money, and broke up with him, moving out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Justin is 20, which is a big age difference. He has Asperger's, which might affect how he processes emotions and relationships. The author was financially dependent on him for a time, which could complicate the relationship power balance. She mentions that she didn't love him as he loved her, so maybe the relationship wasn't equal in emotional investment. She used him for financial stability, but when she became financially independent, she ended the relationship. \n\nIs it wrong to end a relationship when you gain financial independence? On one hand, she was in a position where she was dependent, which can be a source of pressure. When she became independent, it's natural to reassess the relationship. However, the fact that she broke up after gaining stability might make Justin feel like she only stayed for his support, which could hurt him. The question is whether ending the relationship was fair. Since she didn't love him, continuing the relationship could be seen as unfair. However, breaking up after becoming independent might feel like an abandonment, especially given his age and possible emotional maturity level.\n\nAge difference is significant here. At 20, Justin is still young and possibly not as emotionally mature. The author being 29 is almost a generation older. That might affect how each handles the breakup. Also, Justin's Asperger's could mean he struggles with understanding the breakup or handling rejection. The author tried to console him, suggesting she felt some responsibility. But is that enough? \n\nThe author's actions: she ended the relationship when she felt she didn't need him anymore. But if the relationship was supposed to be more than just a financial support system, then ending it because of her own financial gain might be seen as self-serving. However, if the relationship was never based on love and mutual respect, then ending it might be justified. \n\nI need to consider if there were other factors. The author didn't love him, which is a key point. Relationships without mutual love can be problematic. She might have been using him, even if she thought she was in a relationship. But when she got her own financial footing, she felt it was time to leave. Is that being in the wrong? It depends on whether the relationship was built on a foundation of mutual care or exploitation. If she was using him for financial support and then left when she didn't need it, that's more of a problem. But if she was in a casual arrangement and later realized she didn't want a serious relationship, maybe not. However, she mentions she was in a committed relationship (living together, etc.), so ending it after gaining independence might be seen as breaking things off when it's convenient for her. \n\nAlso, the fact that Justin provided for her financially might have created a dependency. Ending the relationship suddenly could be seen as leaving him in a worse position, especially if he was emotionally invested. But the author didn't force him into the relationship; he chose to invest in her. So maybe it's her right to end it when she's ready. However, the way she ended it\u2014suggesting friends with benefits which he rejected\u2014might add to his distress. \n\nIn terms of societal views, some might see her as selfish for using him, while others might see her as making a necessary decision for her own well-being. The age difference and his Asperger's might make him more vulnerable, so her responsibility could be higher. But she isn't necessarily at fault if the relationship was never built on equality or mutual love. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there are elements where her actions could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the core issue is the lack of mutual love. If she was in a relationship without loving him, perhaps the breakup is justified. But the way she handled it and the timing based on her financial gain could be problematic. \n\nFinal take: The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she ended the relationship when she realized she didn't love him, and the financial dependency was a factor in their dynamic. However, some might argue A because she used him financially before leaving. The key is whether the lack of love justifies the breakup. Since she didn't love him, it's a valid reason to end the relationship, so she's not the asshole. Therefore, answer B.\n"
