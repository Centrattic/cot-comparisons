We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. The story is about a 29-year-old woman who was in a relationship with a 20-year-old man named Justin. They had been dating over a year, and she was in a low-income situation, working odd jobs. She met Justin when she was cleaning his apartment, and he had Asperger's. They started a relationship, and he supported her financially when she lost her job. She moved in with him, but didn't love him as he did. When she got a better job, she broke up with him, and he's upset. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the age difference, the financial dependency, the lack of mutual love, and the sudden breakup after financial stability. The user wants to know if the author made a mistake.\n\nThe author moved in with Justin because her apartment was bad, and he was her main financial support. But she didn't reciprocate his feelings. When she got a better job, she broke up, which might have been self-serving. However, she tried to console him and even suggested a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, relationships should be based on mutual respect and love. If the author was in the relationship primarily for financial reasons and not out of love, then breaking up when she no longer needed the support might be seen as selfish. However, she had the right to pursue her own opportunities and independence. The issue is whether she was honest about her feelings earlier. If she stayed in the relationship knowing she didn't love him, that could be problematic. But given that Justin's Asperger's might make him less perceptive to her feelings, maybe she didn't communicate it clearly. \n\nAlso, considering the power dynamic where she was financially dependent on him, breaking up when she's more stable could be seen as a positive step towards independence. However, the suddenness and the fact that she didn't love him could be seen as a betrayal of his feelings. \n\nSo, there's a balance between personal growth and the emotional impact on the other person. The question is whether the author's actions were justified. In many cases, people are allowed to prioritize their own needs, but the way she handled it might be questionable. Since she didn't love him and stayed in the relationship for financial reasons, breaking up when she could afford to might be her right. However, the lack of love and the financial dependency could imply that the relationship wasn't healthy from the start. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because she was prioritizing her own well-being and growth. But the way she handled the breakup, especially considering Justin's emotional state, might be seen as insensitive. However, given the circumstances, it's a complex situation. The answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong) because people have the right to their own happiness and independence, but there's a gray area. However, the subreddit often leans towards the idea that if you're not in love and choose to end the relationship when you can, it's not your fault. But if you led someone on, that's different. Since she didn't love him and it's a mutual choice when she's in a better position, maybe she's not the asshole. So answer B.\n"
