We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the story (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is that she broke up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. They were together for over a year, and he was 20 while she's 29. She mentions that she was in a low-income situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. He was nice but she didn't love him. She moved in with him, lost her job, and relied on him for support. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. She feels bad now.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The age difference is significant\u201420 vs. 29. That might bring up questions about the relationship's power balance. She was in a financial bind and moved in with him, which could imply she was dependent on him. He was buying her things, which might be a red flag if it's one-sided. The fact that she didn't love him but stayed might be the issue. However, when she got a stable job, she decided to leave, which is her choice. \n\nWas the relationship healthy? If she was using him financially and emotionally, that's a problem. But she did break up because she felt she didn't love him, which is a valid reason. However, the way she left and the fact that she was financially dependent on him might make her the asshole. Also, moving in with him and then leaving after getting stability could be seen as using him for his resources. \n\nBut on the other hand, she had the right to pursue her job and better life. If the relationship was unequal from the start, maybe she's not wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. The key points are her lack of love, his age and possible naivety, and her financial dependence. The fact that she broke up when she had the means to be independent might justify her decision, but the way she handled it and the emotional impact on him could be seen as harsh. \n\nI think the answer is A, she's in the wrong because she was using him and didn't consider his feelings, but there are arguments both ways. However, the community might see her as the asshole for leaving after taking advantage of his generosity.\n"
