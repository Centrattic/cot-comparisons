We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a relationship between two people with a significant age gap and different life circumstances. The author is 29, and Justin is 20. They were dating for over a year. The author was in a tough financial situation, taking odd jobs, including cleaning, which is how they met. Justin, living in a luxury condo, was buying her things and she moved in with him after losing her job. She didn't love him but they had a casual relationship that turned into something more. She broke up with him after getting a better job and building savings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author was financially dependent on Justin, moving in with him after losing her job. That could be a red flag. Financial dependency in a relationship can create power imbalances. Also, the age difference\u2014Justin is 20, so he's a young adult, possibly still in college or just starting his career. The author might have taken advantage of his generosity, using his resources to support herself while she was in a low point. \n\nBut then, she got a better job and gained financial independence. That's when she decided to break up. She felt she didn't love him, and he was in love with her. The breakup caused him emotional distress. The question is whether she's in the wrong for ending the relationship after becoming independent. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both parties are emotionally invested and compatible. If she didn't love him and was only in the relationship for his support, that's a problem. However, she did move in with him and accepted gifts. But once she became financially stable, she ended it. That could be seen as using him for financial support, which is not fair. On the other hand, if she realized she wasn't in love and wanted to pursue her own life after securing her position, maybe it's a responsible decision. \n\nBut the key point is whether she was honest. Did she ever communicate her feelings to him before the breakup? The story says she was going to tell him it was strictly casual but he started to like her. So maybe she led him on, creating an emotional connection under false pretenses. That would make her the asshole. If she didn't express her lack of feelings clearly and instead took advantage of his emotions and resources, then she's in the wrong. \n\nAlso, moving in with him after losing her job and then breaking up when she's financially stable might look like she used him. The fact that she tried to console him after breaking up but he was devastated adds to the emotional impact. The friends-with-benefits offer after breaking up could have been insensitive, especially if he was still emotionally attached. \n\nConsidering all these factors, it seems like the author might be in the wrong because she didn't communicate her feelings honestly and possibly used Justin for his support while he was emotionally invested. Ending the relationship once she was financially stable without considering the emotional consequences could be seen as selfish. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
