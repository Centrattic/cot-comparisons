We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who's 29, was in a year-long relationship with Justin, 20, who has Asperger's. They met when the author was cleaning his apartment. Justin was providing financial support since the author was struggling with low-income jobs. The author then got a better job, saved money, and decided to break up.\n\nHmm. So the main points here: the age difference is 9 years. Justin was providing financial support, and the author was living with him. The author felt the relationship wasn't based on mutual love, and after becoming more financially stable, decided to leave. Justin is upset and the author feels bad about it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about the dynamics. Justin is younger, has Asperger's, which might make it harder for him to navigate relationships. The author was taking advantage of Justin's financial stability, moving in with him, and then when she could support herself, left. But she didn't force anything; she ended the relationship because she didn't love him. \n\nWas there deception? The author mentions she didn't tell Justin it was strictly casual, even though he started to love her. That could be an issue. Also, moving in together and relying on his support might have led him to believe the relationship was serious. However, the author is taking responsibility by trying to explain and even offering a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which Justin rejected.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author had the right to leave if she wasn't in love, but there might have been a lack of clear communication from the start. The age gap and Justin's vulnerability (due to age and Asperger's) could make some argue the author had more responsibility. But she's not exploiting him financially, she's moving on, which is her right. The key here is whether there was an understanding of the relationship's nature. If the author didn't clarify it was casual from the start, maybe she's partly at fault. But overall, the decision to end the relationship because of lack of love isn't necessarily wrong. So probably the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
