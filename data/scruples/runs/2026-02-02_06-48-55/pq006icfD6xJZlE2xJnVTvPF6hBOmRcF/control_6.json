We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who is 29, was in a relationship with Justin, who is 20. They had been dating over a year. The author was in a low-paying job, cleaning apartments, which led to meeting Justin. He has Asperger's, and they started a physical relationship. Justin supported her financially, bought her stuff, and she moved in with him. The author didn't love him but was using him for financial support. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. Now Justin is upset, and the author is wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The age difference is significant\u2014Justin is 20, which is considered a minor in some places. The author is 29, so there's a 9-year gap. That raises questions about power dynamics and consent. Also, Justin having Asperger's might affect his ability to understand the relationship dynamics. The author mentions that Justin was buying her things, supporting her financially, and she moved in with him. She wasn't in love with him but stayed for financial reasons. When she got a better job, she broke up, which left Justin devastated.\n\nNow, looking at the ethical aspects. The author might have taken advantage of Justin's vulnerability, especially considering his Asperger's and the age difference. If she was using him for financial support and then left when she no longer needed it, that's a red flag. Emotional manipulation could be at play here. Also, the fact that Justin was providing her with material support while she was in a job that's lower paying might indicate an imbalance in the relationship. The breakup seems to be based on her financial independence rather than genuine emotional reasons, which could be seen as selfish.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that she was in a difficult situation financially and found a way to improve her life. She didn't force Justin into the relationship; he was the one who wanted to be with her. She did try to console him after breaking up, even suggesting a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. She moved out and is feeling some guilt, which might indicate she isn't entirely heartless.\n\nBut the core issue here is whether she exploited Justin. The age gap and his Asperger's could make him more susceptible to being taken advantage of. If the relationship was based on her using him for financial stability and then leaving once she was no longer dependent, that's a problem. Relationships should be based on mutual respect and affection, not just practical benefits. The fact that she didn't love him but stayed for material reasons suggests a lack of genuine commitment. Breaking up when her circumstances improved, rather than staying for emotional reasons, might be seen as using him as a means to an end.\n\nSo, considering all that, it does look like the author was in a position of power due to the age difference and Justin's vulnerabilities. Her actions\u2014staying for financial support and leaving once she was financially stable\u2014could be seen as exploiting him. Therefore, she might be in the wrong.\n"
