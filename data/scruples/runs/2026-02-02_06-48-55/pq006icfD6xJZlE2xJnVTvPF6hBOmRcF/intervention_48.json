We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the age difference: she's 29, he's 20. Justin is 9 years younger. That might affect the dynamic, but age alone doesn't determine right or wrong. Then there's the dynamic of their relationship. She was in a low-paying job, cleaning, living in a poor area, and he was in a luxury condo. She met him through a cleaning job. He was nice but had Asperger's, which might explain some of his behaviors.\n\nShe mentions he was buying her groceries, clothes, a winter coat, and she moved in with him. She says he was kind of her \"meal ticket\" when she lost her job. So there was a financial dependency on his part. But she didn't love him the way he loved her. Then she got a better job, saved money, and decided to break up. She tried to console him, even offered friends with benefits, but he was upset. She feels bad about it.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's look at the key points. She broke up because she didn't love him, and after securing her financial situation. He was emotionally attached and she used his resources when she was in a bad economic position. However, when she became more financially stable, she ended the relationship. That could be seen as using him for support when she needed it, then leaving once she no longer needed it. That's a classic \"user\" scenario, which is often frowned upon in relationships. Even if there's no legal or physical harm, emotionally, it's a tough spot for him, especially with Asperger's potentially making it harder for him to process or move on.\n\nHowever, she did try to be considerate by offering friendship and consoling him. The fact that he's devastated is a result of his own feelings, which are valid. But the question is about her actions. If she didn't love him and was in a relationship that wasn't healthy or reciprocal, maybe she's justified. But the timing\u2014leaving after becoming financially stable\u2014might be seen as exploiting his resources. Also, moving in with him because her apartment was bad, and then leaving after improving her situation. It could be a case of emotional manipulation or taking advantage of his kindness during her time of need.\n\nOn the other hand, if she's honest about not loving him and ends the relationship when she has the means to be independent, some might argue she's doing the right thing by not staying in an unbalanced or unloving relationship. But the key here is whether she had a responsibility to him. Since he was buying her things and supporting her financially when she was struggling, ending the relationship once she's stable could be seen as breaking a trust or emotional bond, especially if he believed they were in a committed relationship.\n\nThe community's perspective on AITA (Am I the Asshole) usually considers intentions and fairness. If she was honest from the start that it was casual, maybe different. But she mentions she was going to tell him it was strictly casual but he started to love her. That implies she might have led him on, creating expectations that weren't met. If she didn't communicate her intentions clearly and allowed him to invest emotionally, that's a problem.\n\nSo putting it all together: She was in a relationship where she didn't love him, took advantage of his financial support, and ended it when it was convenient for her. That seems like she's in the wrong because she didn't maintain honest communication and may have used him for support during her time of need. The answer would be A.\n"
