We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that she's 29 and her ex-boyfriend is 20. They were dating for over a year. She was in a financial struggle, working odd jobs, including cleaning the apartment of the guy who is now her ex. He has Asperger's, which might affect his social interactions. They started a relationship, he bought her things, she moved in with him. She didn't love him as much as he loved her. She got a better job, saved money, and then broke up with him. He was upset, and she feels some guilt but also isn't sure if she did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. She was in a relationship where the emotional investment wasn't mutual. She felt it was more casual, but he started to love her. He provided financial support when she was in a tough spot. She moved in with him because her living conditions were bad. Now, when she's in a better financial position, she decides to end the relationship. The question is whether that makes her the asshole.\n\nFrom her perspective, she might feel that the relationship wasn't right for her. She didn't love him the way he loved her, and she's choosing her financial stability and moving on. But she had benefited from his financial support during a difficult time, and now she's left him. The age difference is also notable\u2014Justin is 20, which is a minor in many places. However, the relationship was consensual, so that's not the issue here.\n\nThe ethical question here is about responsibility and honesty. Did she mislead him about her feelings? She mentioned she was going to tell him it was strictly casual but he started to like her more. If she didn't love him, but stayed in the relationship, maybe she was using him, especially when he was providing financial support. She moved in with him, which is a significant step, but she didn't reciprocate the emotional investment. Then when she got a better job, she broke up with him, which could be seen as using him as a means to an end.\n\nOn the other hand, she's also in a difficult situation, financially struggling, and found a way to improve her life. She might not have intended to lead him on, but perhaps didn't communicate her feelings clearly. The fact that she tried to console him and offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement shows some consideration, but it didn't work out. The problem here is whether her actions were justified given the circumstances.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is key. If she didn't have feelings for him, she should have communicated that earlier. Staying in the relationship and moving in with him without mutual commitment might be seen as leading him on. Her breaking up when she's in a better position could be seen as self-serving, but she's also taking control of her life. However, the fact that he was providing significant support when she needed it adds complexity. She might be taking advantage of his kindness and then leaving without considering the impact on him.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. She was financially dependent on him, which could affect the balance of the relationship. Breaking up when she's no longer dependent might be a natural progression, but it's still abrupt. The age difference could also imply that he's less experienced in relationships, making him more vulnerable. Her decision to break up might not be inherently wrong, but the lack of communication about her feelings during the relationship could be a problem.\n\nIn conclusion, whether she's in the wrong depends on whether she was honest about her intentions. If she led him to believe there was a future when she didn't have feelings for him, that's an issue. If she was clear from the start that it was casual, then maybe not. Since she mentions she intended to tell him it was casual but he developed feelings, she might have a responsibility to communicate her lack of feelings sooner rather than later. By staying in the relationship and moving in with him without that clarity, she might be in the wrong. So, the answer is A: Yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
