We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's 29, was in a relationship with Justin, 20, for over a year. She ended up moving in with him after losing her job and relying on him financially. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him, moving out. Now she's feeling bad about it, and the question is whether she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The age difference is significant\u2014she's 29, he's 20. That alone might raise some red flags about the relationship's power dynamics. She mentions that she was in a low-income situation, moving in with him after losing her job. He was buying her things like groceries and a coat, which might indicate a financial dependency on her part. She also says she didn't love him but he loved her. Then she gets a good job, becomes more financially stable, and decides to break up. \n\nNow, is it wrong to break up because she's now financially independent? Relationships are supposed to be based on mutual affection and respect. If she never loved him but he was dependent on her, maybe there was an imbalance. But when she got a better job, she no longer needed him, so she ended things. But was it fair to Justin? He's 20, which is still a young age, and maybe he was emotionally vulnerable. Also, she moved in with him when she was in a bad situation, which could be seen as taking advantage of his resources. \n\nOn the other hand, she's making an effort to improve her life, securing a better job, saving money. That's positive. But breaking up after forming a relationship, especially when he was dependent on her, might be seen as selfish. The fact that she tried to console him and even suggested a friends-with-benefits arrangement (which he rejected) might indicate she's trying to mitigate the impact, but his devastation suggests it was a big deal for him.\n\nThe question is whether her actions were wrong. Some might argue that entering into a relationship with someone younger, especially when there's a financial imbalance, is problematic. Also, using the relationship for financial support and then leaving once she's stable could be seen as exploiting him. Others might say it's her right to pursue a better life and that she had the right to end the relationship since it wasn't love. \n\nBut the key issue is whether she was honest about her feelings from the start. She mentions she was going to tell him it was casual but he got attached. If she didn't love him, maybe she should have been clearer. Also, moving in with him when she was in a vulnerable position might have put him in a position where he was supporting her, which could lead to dependency. When she left, it disrupted his life, which is understandable. \n\nSo the moral of the story here hinges on whether the relationship was based on mutual consent and honesty. If she wasn't in love with him but allowed the relationship to progress, especially when he was emotionally invested, that might be where the problem lies. But if she ended it after realizing her feelings and taking steps to improve her life, some might see it as a necessary decision. However, the age gap and financial dependency might tip the scales towards her being in the wrong because of the power dynamics involved.\n"
