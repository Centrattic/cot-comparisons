We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author is 29, her ex is 20. They were dating over a year. She was taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. She mentions financial struggles and being poor. Justin, who has Asperger's, was buying her things like groceries, a coat, and they moved in together. She didn't love him but he was emotionally invested. She broke up after getting a better job. Now she feels bad because he's devastated. The question is whether she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if breaking up for personal reasons is justifiable. She was in a relationship that wasn't based on mutual love. She mentions not loving him but he was investing a lot emotionally and financially. However, she was relying on him financially when she had a job loss. Then she got a good job and broke up, which allowed her to move out. \n\nIs it fair for her to end the relationship after becoming more financially stable? Well, if the relationship was one-sided, with her not feeling the emotional connection, maybe she's not wrong for leaving. But she did benefit from his support. However, relationships require mutual commitment. If she wasn't in love and he was emotionally dependent, perhaps she should have ended it earlier to avoid hurting him more. \n\nOn the other hand, she's not obligated to stay in a relationship where she doesn't feel love. The fact that she was using him as a meal ticket might complicate things, but she's now moving on. The key points are the emotional investment from him and her lack thereof. The age gap is significant, which might affect the dynamic. \n\nAlso, she tried to console him and offered friendship, but he was upset. She moved out. The question is whether her decision to leave was wrong. Since she's not in love and the breakup was mutual for her personal growth, maybe she's not the asshole. But she did wait until she had financial security, which could be seen as exploiting him. However, the main issue is whether she's responsible for his emotional pain. People can't be responsible for others' feelings. \n\nSo the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's not obligated to stay in an unloving relationship. Even though it's hurtful, she's making a choice for her own well-being. The fact that she moved in with him when she was in a bad apartment and he provided financial support might have been a factor, but once she's stable, leaving isn't wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
