We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me go through the details she provided.\n\nFirst, she's 29, and her ex-boyfriend is 20. They were dating for over a year. She was taking odd jobs, including cleaning apartments, and she met him when she was hired to clean his apartment. He has Asperger's, which might make it harder for him socially, and he was awkward at first but turned out to be sweet. They had a physical relationship, and she even moved in with him because her apartment was bad. He started buying her things like groceries and a nice coat. She lost her job with the cleaning company and had to get a lower-paying one, so Justin was her financial support. She doesn't love him as much as he does. Recently, she got a better job with good pay, saved money, broke up with him a week ago. He's devastated, tried to console him, suggested friends with benefits, which made him angry. She moved out but feels bad.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. So, am I in the wrong? Let's see.\n\nFirst, the relationship dynamics. She was financially dependent on him at some point, but then she got a better job. She moved in with him because her apartment was bad, which might have been a financial decision. She doesn't love him as much as he loves her, which is a red flag. He's 20, so maybe not as mature. She broke up with him after becoming financially stable. \n\nIs it fair to break up because of financial improvement? Well, if she was using him as a financial support and then left when she didn't need that anymore, that could be seen as selfish. But she didn't have a lot of expenses with him because of his support. Also, he's young, so she was with someone significantly younger, which might have been a factor. She took his virginity and started a relationship, but she didn't love him. That could be an issue. Ending the relationship when she's financially stable might be her way of moving on, but if it's a genuine relationship, ending it just because it's convenient might be wrong.\n\nBut from her perspective, she was in a situation where she was financially struggling, and he provided support. Then she improved her situation and ended it. It's possible that the relationship wasn't based on mutual love and respect, but more on dependency. However, she did move in with him and accepted his gifts. Breaking up after gaining financial stability could be seen as using him, but if she genuinely didn't have feelings for him, it's her right to end it. \n\nThe key points here are the age difference, financial dependency, and emotional investment. Since she doesn't love him, continuing the relationship would be unfair to him. But breaking up when she's financially secure might be a form of abandonment. However, if the relationship was never based on love and mutual respect, ending it is justified. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she continued the relationship without loving him, that's the problem. But if she realized she wasn't in love and ended it, that's her right. However, the way she ended it might be harsh, especially since he's 20 and has Asperger's, which might make it harder for him to handle the breakup. But she tried to console him, even suggested friends with benefits, which he rejected. \n\nIn conclusion, if the relationship was never based on mutual love and she used him for support, then breaking up when she could take care of herself isn't wrong. However, if she was leading him on without intentions of commitment, that's where the issue is. Since she moved in with him and accepted his gifts, maybe she contributed to his feelings, leading to the hurt. But she did break up when she was in a better position, which is a responsible move. So maybe she's not in the wrong.\n"
