We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong after breaking up with her boyfriend Justin because she got a good job. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, their relationship dynamics. The author is 29, Justin is 20. They were dating for over a year. The author was in a financial struggle, taking odd jobs, and cleaning apartments. Justin lives in a luxurious condo, which is part of the gentrified area. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. Justin has Asperger's, which might affect how he processes emotions. He was initially awkward but became a sweetheart. They had a physical relationship, and Justin started buying her things like groceries and clothes, including a winter coat. The author moved in with him from her crumbling apartment. She lost her job and maybe relied on Justin financially. She didn't love him as much as he loved her. Then, she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. Justin is devastated, she tried to console him but he's angry, even when she suggested remaining friends with benefits. She feels bad but moved out.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical aspects here. Relationships are supposed to be based on mutual affection and support. The author seems to have been in a relationship where Justin was providing financial support because she was in a tough spot. But she didn't have the same level of love for him. Then, once she became financially stable, she ended the relationship. \n\nIs it wrong to end a relationship once your circumstances change? Well, people can't be forced into relationships out of obligation. If the author wasn't in love and was using Justin for financial support, that's problematic. However, she did move in with him, which suggests some level of commitment. But the key point is that she didn't love him and was using him. Breaking up when her situation improved might be seen as self-serving, but she's not in the wrong for not being in love. However, the way she ended it\u2014telling him to find another girl and suggesting friends with benefits after making him angry\u2014might be harsh. \n\nJustin's Asperger's might make it harder for him to handle emotional changes, so her approach in the breakup could be insensitive. Also, the power dynamic here: she was financially dependent on him, which might have made the relationship unequal. Now that she's stable, she leaves. But she isn't obligated to stay in an unloved relationship. However, the sudden breakup without considering his feelings might be the issue. \n\nOn the other hand, she's not the one who was in love; he was. She's ending a relationship that wasn't mutually fulfilling. Financial dependence can complicate relationships, and moving on when she can support herself is understandable. But she might have a moral obligation to handle the breakup more compassionately. The fact that she feels bad shows she has some empathy. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she was in love and left for a better opportunity, that could be seen as selfish. But she never loved him and was using him financially. Once she's stable, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong because she's not in a loving partnership. However, the manner of the breakup could be handled better. But the question is whether she's in the wrong, not whether she could have been more empathetic. The core issue is whether leaving after the circumstances changed is acceptable. \n\nIn relationships, if there's no mutual love, it's not wrong to end it. However, using someone for financial support and then leaving when you no longer need them could be seen as exploiting them. But the author mentions she didn't love him, so it's more about the lack of emotional connection. It's a bit of a gray area. If the relationship was based on financial support, and the emotional aspect wasn't there, then ending it isn't the author's fault. However, if Justin felt like he was being used and she didn't care, that's where the conflict lies. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the relationship was founded on mutual respect and affection or if it was transactional. The author might have been in a situation where she was dependent, but once she's independent, she leaves. That's not inherently wrong, but the ethical consideration is if she should have stayed out of obligation. Since she didn't love him, she's not obligated. But the way she left might be the problem. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If the relationship wasn't based on love from her side, she's not the asshole for ending it. Justin might have been using her for companionship, but the author isn't wrong for seeking a better situation. \n\nSo, probably answer B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's anything else. The fact that she moved in with him and he was providing for her might imply a more committed relationship than just casual. If she led him on or gave him false hope, that would be wrong. But she mentions she didn't love him, so maybe she never intended a long-term commitment. However, she did accept his support and moved in, which could be seen as leading him on. \n\nThis is tricky. If she didn't love him and was using him, she's in the wrong for not being honest about her intentions. But if she tried to be honest and he still pursued a relationship, then it's his choice. The user's own answer says they think the author is in the wrong, but I'm not sure. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be seen as selfish, but ethically, ending an unreciprocated relationship isn't inherently wrong. However, the exploitation aspect could make her at fault. Given the details, I think the answer is A (in the wrong) because she used him for financial support and then left when she no longer needed it, which is exploitative. But if she was honest from the start, it's different. Since she didn't tell him it was strictly casual and led him to believe they were in a committed relationship, she's in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
