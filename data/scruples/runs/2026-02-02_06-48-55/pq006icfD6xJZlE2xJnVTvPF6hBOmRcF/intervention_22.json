We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's 29, was dating Justin, 20, who has Asperger's. They met when the author was cleaning his apartment. Justin was buying her stuff, she moved in with him after losing her job. She didn't love him but he was in love with her. She gets a better job, saves money, and breaks up with him. Now, he's devastated, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Justin was 20, which is a big age difference. The author was in a financial situation where she was taking odd jobs and had a crumbling apartment. Justin provided support, including clothing and a place to live. However, she mentions that she didn't love him the way he loved her. The key point here is that she broke up with him after becoming financially stable. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she's taking control of her life after securing a good job, which is understandable. She might feel that she can now be independent and doesn't want to be in a relationship where the feelings aren't mutual. On the other hand, Justin was younger, had Asperger's, and relied on her for emotional and financial support. Breaking up abruptly might have been hard on him, especially if he had formed a strong attachment.\n\nBut the author did try to console him and even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. She also moved out and into a new apartment. The main issue is whether she was justified in breaking up because she didn't love him. In relationships, mutual commitment and emotional connection are important. If she didn't have feelings for him, then staying in the relationship might not have been fair to either of them. However, the age difference and Justin's condition might mean he needed more stability or emotional support. \n\nBut the author did take the initiative to end the relationship rather than prolonging it. Ending a relationship when it's not working is not inherently wrong. The question is if there was manipulation or if she used Justin for his financial support. However, the narrative suggests that the author was in a vulnerable financial position and relied on Justin's support initially. Now that she's stable, she's choosing to leave, which is her right. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She made a decision based on her feelings and newfound stability. The main issue is whether the breakup was handled respectfully, which she tried to do. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check again. Did she exploit him? Maybe there's an element of that, but she did move in with him of her own choice. It's a tricky situation, but I think breaking up because of lack of love isn't wrong. So answer B.\n"
