We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she broke up with her boyfriend Justin after getting a good job. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, their age difference: she's 29, he's 20. That's a nine-year gap. Justin has Asperger's, which might affect how he handles relationships and emotions. They met when she was cleaning his apartment, and there was a clear power dynamic there\u2014she was his employee. Then they started a relationship, which could be a red flag because of the employer-employee relationship. \n\nShe mentions that she didn't love him but was using him for financial support, moving in with him, and he was buying her things. That sounds like she was taking advantage of him, especially considering his vulnerability due to Asperger's. Then she got a better job, became financially stable, and decided to break up. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she's taking control of her life, getting out of a potentially unstable or exploitative situation. On the other hand, breaking up after using him for financial support might be seen as selfish. However, if the relationship wasn't based on mutual love and she knew she didn't love him, maybe it's not entirely her fault. But the fact that she moved in with him, relied on his support, and then left when she no longer needed him could be seen as manipulative. Also, the employer-employee dynamic complicating the relationship might be a factor. \n\nI think there are elements of her being in the wrong, especially in how she handled the relationship and the breakup. But there's also her own need for stability and growth. It's a bit of a gray area, but since she admitted she didn't love him and used him, maybe the answer is A.\n"
