We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. The situation is a bit complex. The author is 29, and her ex is 20 with Asperger's. They were together for over a year. She was in a financial situation where she took odd jobs, including cleaning apartments. She met Justin while cleaning his apartment, and he started buying her things, even helped her move in. She lost her job and had to take a lower-paying one, so she was dependent on him financially. Now she got a good job, saved money, and broke up with him. He's devastated, and she's feeling bad about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The age difference is significant\u20149 years. Justin is 20, so he's still pretty young. He has Asperger's, which might affect how he processes relationships and emotions. The author mentions she didn't love him as much as he loved her. She broke up with him after becoming financially stable again. \n\nThe key points here are financial dependency and emotional investment. She was in a position where she relied on Justin for financial support, groceries, clothes, etc. Once she got a better job, she broke up, which he took very hard. The question is whether she's in the wrong for ending the relationship once she's more stable. \n\nOn one hand, people have the right to end relationships if they're not feeling the same level of love. On the other hand, if she was using him for financial support and then left once she didn't need that support anymore, that could be seen as taking advantage. However, the user mentioned she was in a poor situation and had to take the job that led her to meet Justin. She didn't start the relationship with the intention of being together long-term, but Justin developed deeper feelings. \n\nThe author claims she didn't love him like he loved her. In a healthy relationship, both parties should have mutual feelings. If she wasn't capable of loving him as he did, ending the relationship might be necessary for her. However, the way she ended it might be questionable. She offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. She moved out, but he's still upset. \n\nFinancial dependency can complicate relationships. If she was financially reliant on him and then left once she was stable, some might see that as using him. However, she was in a difficult financial situation, and the job was a result of her circumstances. It's possible she didn't enter the relationship with the intention of exploiting him, but the situation evolved into her depending on him financially. \n\nThe fact that Justin has Asperger's might make it harder for him to understand the relationship's shift. He might have a harder time moving on because of his condition, which could make the breakup more painful for him. However, the author's responsibility isn't necessarily to stay in the relationship out of pity or obligation, especially if the feelings aren't mutual. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the user is asking if the author is the asshole. The answer hinges on whether the author used the relationship for financial gain and then left. If she was in a vulnerable financial state and the relationship provided her with necessary support, breaking up once she's better off isn't necessarily wrong. However, if she knew from the start that she wasn't committed and used him, then it's wrong. \n\nThe author didn't explicitly state that she intended to use him, but the fact that she moved in with him out of a \"crumbling apartment\" and relied on his purchases suggests that financial dependency was a factor. The key is whether the relationship was based on mutual affection or if she was taking advantage. Since she claims she didn't love him, but he loved her, the breakup is more about her not being able to reciprocate feelings, which isn't inherently wrong. \n\nHowever, the way she handled the breakup might be questionable. Telling him to find another girl and offering a friends-with-benefits arrangement could be seen as dismissive, especially given his condition. But the core issue is whether the breakup itself is wrong. If a relationship is not based on mutual love and one party is in a better position to end it, that's a personal choice. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong for ending the relationship if she wasn't loving him as he loved her. However, there's a gray area because of the financial dependency. But given that she was in a difficult situation and the relationship wasn't fulfilling for her emotionally, her choice might be justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
