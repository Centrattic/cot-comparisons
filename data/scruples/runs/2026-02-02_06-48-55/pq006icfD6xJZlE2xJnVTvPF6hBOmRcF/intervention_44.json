We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario is about breaking up with a boyfriend after getting a good job. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is 29, and Justin is 20 with Asperger's. They met when the author was cleaning his apartment. Justin was giving her financial support (groceries, clothes, moving in together) because she was struggling financially. The author didn't love him the way he loved her, and after getting a better job, she broke up with him. Now she's feeling guilty.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate this. Was the relationship based on love or convenience? The author mentions that Justin was the one who started to like her more, while she only saw him as a casual partner at first. She moved in with him due to financial instability. Now that she's financially stable, she left him. \n\nIs it the author's fault for seeking a better life? People can leave relationships if they realize it's not right for them, even if it causes emotional pain. However, Justin might feel used, especially since he had a significant emotional investment. The age difference and Justin's Asperger's might affect his ability to handle the breakup. \n\nBut the author isn't staying out of spite; she's moving on because she's found stability. It's a matter of personal growth. However, she was dependent on him financially, which could be a factor. Maybe she should have communicated better or considered his feelings more before leaving. But ultimately, she's not obligated to stay in a relationship that isn't reciprocal. \n\nI think the key here is whether the breakup was justified. If the author didn't love Justin, and she's now able to support herself, it's her right to leave. However, the way she left might be harsh, especially since Justin was emotionally invested. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the method. So, maybe the answer is B\u2014she's not in the wrong because she's choosing herself.\n"
