We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the woman is 29, and her ex is 20. They were dating for over a year. She was in a tough financial situation, taking odd jobs, including cleaning apartments. She met Justin, who lives in a luxury condo, during one of those cleaning jobs. Justin has Asperger's, which might affect how he handles relationships. They had a physical relationship, and he started buying her things, even helped her move in. She lost her job with the cleaning company and had to take a lower-paying one, implying she was financially dependent on Justin.\n\nThen she got a good job, saved money, and broke up with him. She tried to remain friends with benefits, but he refused. Now she feels bad about leaving him.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's the asshole. Let's consider both sides. From her perspective, she was in a relationship where she wasn't sure she loved him. She ended it when she became financially stable. Maybe she felt trapped financially before and now wanted to pursue her own life. On the other hand, Justin was in love and she might have led him on, using him for financial support. Breaking up after securing a job could be seen as dumping him once she had her needs met, which is cold. Also, the age difference might matter\u2014she's almost ten years older, which could indicate a power imbalance. Justin's autism might make him more vulnerable. She moved in with him, accepted his financial help, and then left. She might not have been honest about her feelings early on, leading him to believe they were in a committed relationship. \n\nBut she did try to console him. However, the key issue is whether she's in the wrong. If she wasn't in love with him and ended the relationship when she was in a better position, maybe it's not her fault. But if the relationship was based on her financial reliance and she didn't communicate her true feelings, that's a problem. Also, breaking up after benefiting from the relationship could be seen as selfish. The fact that she took his virginity and he was emotionally invested adds to the complexity. The community often looks at whether the person acted with consideration. Since she ended it when she was financially stable, maybe she's not the asshole. But the way she used him for financial support while not being in love could make her the asshole. It's a tough call, but leaning towards her not being in the wrong because she's prioritizing her own life and independence now that she can afford it. Alternatively, if she didn't address the issues earlier, it's her fault. Hmm.\n"
