We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. The story is about a 29-year-old woman who broke up with her 20-year-old boyfriend, Justin, after getting a good job. They had been dating over a year, and she was in a tough financial situation, relying on him for some things. Now she's moved on and feels bad but is wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The woman met Justin while cleaning his apartment. He has Asperger's, which makes social interactions challenging. They started a relationship, and she admits she doesn't love him as much as he does. Justin supported her financially when she lost her job, and she moved in with him. Now she's in a better job, saving money, and broke up with him. He's upset, and she's feeling guilty.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The main question is whether her decision to break up was the right one. Let's consider the relationship dynamics. They were in a relationship where the woman had financial instability. Justin provided support, which is a big deal. But the woman didn't love him, which is a crucial emotional aspect. Relationships need mutual affection and commitment to thrive, not just financial support.\n\nBreaking up when one person isn't in love can be valid. The woman might feel she's not giving him the emotional connection he needs. However, the timing is after Justin supported her financially, and she's moving up. That could add to the perception of using him, even if that's not the case. The story mentions that she tried to console him and even suggested friends with benefits, but he was hurt. \n\nIf the relationship wasn't built on love from both sides, then the breakup might be her way of being honest. But the way she handled it could be questionable. Was it a mature breakup? Did she communicate properly? The story says she tried to console him, but maybe it wasn't enough. Also, the significant age difference\u201429 vs. 20\u2014might be a red flag for others, but it's not inherently wrong.\n\nJustin's Asperger's is mentioned, which might affect his ability to process the breakup emotionally. He might struggle with social cues or emotional responses. The woman might have to consider his needs more, but she also has her own. The problem is whether she was honest from the start. She mentions she was going to tell him it was strictly casual but didn't because he got attached. That implies she might have led him on, which could be a point against her. If she never clearly communicated her intentions and let him believe it was more serious than it was, that's a problem. \n\nAdditionally, moving in together when she was in a vulnerable financial state could have created an imbalance. When she got the job, maybe she felt the dynamic was changing, and the relationship wasn't sustainable. But she did move in with him, suggesting some level of commitment. Then breaking up when her situation improved might look like she was only there for his financial support. \n\nHowever, the woman might have realized she wasn't emotionally invested and decided to end the relationship before it becomes more problematic. The key here is communication. If she didn't set boundaries early on and now is ending it, that could be seen as inconsiderate. But if the relationship was never based on love from her side, ending it might be necessary for both to find better matches.\n\nSo, considering all factors: lack of love from her, possible miscommunication about the relationship's nature, and the financial aspect. It's a tough call, but I think the woman is not in the wrong if she genuinely didn't love him and was honest when she ended it, even if there were financial dependencies. But the way she handled it and the lack of clear communication could be points where she's at fault. The story says she tried to console him and offered a friends with benefits option, which he rejected. So while the breakup is her choice, the \"friends with benefits\" after breaking up might not have been the best approach. Still, the core issue is her lack of love. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong, because she's prioritizing her own needs and honesty, even if it's difficult.\n"
