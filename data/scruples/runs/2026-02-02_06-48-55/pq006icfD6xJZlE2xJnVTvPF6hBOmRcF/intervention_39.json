We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The situation involves a significant age difference, with the woman being 29 and the boyfriend 20. She was in a financial struggle, moved in with him after losing her job, and relied on him for support. Then she got a better job, saved money, and decided to break up, causing him emotional distress.\n\nFirst, consider consent and mutual understanding. The user mentions that she didn't love him as he loved her. It's important to know if there were any commitments or expectations in the relationship. If the relationship wasn't based on mutual love and she was in a position where she could now be independent, ending it to pursue her own life might be justified. However, the dynamic where she relied on him financially might complicate things. Did she lead him on, making him believe there was a future together?\n\nAlso, the age gap of nine years could mean different life stages. He's still young, maybe in school or early career, while she's moving forward. Her decision might be about her own growth. But did she have a responsibility to handle the breakup more sensitively? She tried to console him and offered a friend-benefit arrangement, which he rejected. That shows she attempted to manage the transition, but perhaps it wasn't enough. \n\nThe key points are whether the breakup was honest and if she was transparent about her feelings from the start. If she was only casual and never intended a serious relationship, then leaving once her circumstances changed might be her right. However, if she led him to believe there was a future and then left for her own benefit without considering his emotional state, that could be seen as wrong. \n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend was providing financial support, which might have created an imbalance. When she became financially stable, ending the relationship could be about her independence. But if she used him as a means to an end, that's problematic. \n\nIn summary, the writer's actions depend on the initial relationship dynamics. If it was a genuine relationship where she didn't reciprocate feelings and ended it honestly, maybe not in the wrong. But if there was a lack of transparency or if she relied on him emotionally/financially without commitment, then she might be in the wrong. The answer isn't clear-cut, but considering she broke up after gaining independence and tried to be empathetic, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). However, her financial dependence might make it more nuanced. I think the answer is B.\n"
