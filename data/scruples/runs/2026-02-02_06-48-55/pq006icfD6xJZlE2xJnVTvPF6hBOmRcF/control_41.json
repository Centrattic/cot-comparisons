We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 29, and Justin is 20 with Asperger's. They were dating over a year. She was struggling financially, doing odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. Justin started buying her things, and she moved in with him after losing her job. She didn't love him as much as he did. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. Now he's upset, and she feels bad but moved on.\n\nSo, is she wrong? Well, relationships require mutual affection and commitment. If she didn't love him and was staying mainly out of financial need, maybe the relationship wasn't healthy. She chose to leave once her situation improved, which could be seen as prioritizing herself. But Justin's age and condition might affect his ability to handle the breakup. However, the author isn't necessarily at fault for seeking better opportunities and realizing her feelings weren't mutual. The key here is that she ended things when she felt it was necessary, even if it hurt him. Since she didn't force him into the relationship and acted when her circumstances changed, she might not be in the wrong. But some might argue she should have been more honest earlier. But given the info, B (not in the wrong) seems right.\n"
