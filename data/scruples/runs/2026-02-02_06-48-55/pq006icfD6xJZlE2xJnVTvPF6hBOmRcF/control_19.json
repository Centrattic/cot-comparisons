We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe author is 29, her ex is Justin, 20. They dated over a year. She was in a financial struggle, taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. Justin lives in a luxury condo, so there's a socio-economic difference. They met when she was hired to clean his place. Justin has Asperger's, which might affect his emotional understanding. She mentions she took his virginity and they started a relationship. Initially, she intended it to be casual but he developed feelings. He provided her with financial support\u2014groceries, clothes, a coat, and she moved in with him. She lost her cleaning job, so she was dependent on him. She doesn't love him as much as he does. Recently, she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. He's devastated, she tried to console him, suggested friends with benefits, which he rejected. She moved out and feels bad.\n\nNow, the question is if she's in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The relationship might have been asymmetrical in terms of emotional investment. She didn't love him, but he clearly loved her. She was financially dependent on him, which could be a power imbalance. When she got a better job, she broke up, possibly using the job as an excuse to leave. Justin's Asperger's might make it harder for him to process the breakup, and she suggested friends with benefits, which he took badly. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of her financial situation improving. Maybe she felt she needed to move on for her own growth. However, the fact that she was using his financial support when she was in a worse position and then left when she could afford to might be seen as selfish. Also, moving in together and then leaving could have been a significant emotional blow, especially since Justin is more vulnerable due to his condition.\n\nOn the other hand, she might have felt trapped in a relationship where she wasn't loved equally. If she never intended to be in a serious relationship but he did, maybe she should have been clearer. However, she did try to console him and offered a way to stay in touch. But the friends with benefits idea might not have been the best approach given his feelings.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether her actions were justified. If she didn't love him and he was emotionally invested, breaking up when she had the financial means might be seen as her prioritizing her own well-being. But the way she handled it, especially suggesting friends with benefits after breaking up, might be insensitive. However, the core issue is if she was in the wrong for ending the relationship. Since relationships require mutual affection, and she didn't have that, maybe she's not in the wrong. But the financial dependency and the power dynamic could make her responsible for not being honest earlier. Alternatively, she might have a right to move on once her situation improved.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether she used him for financial support and then left when she no longer needed it. If that's the case, yes, she's in the wrong. But if she genuinely didn't love him and tried to break it off when she could, maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the fact that she moved in with him and he was providing for her while she was in a job loss situation might mean she was taking advantage of his generosity. Then, when she got a better job, she left. That could be seen as using him, which would make her the asshole. But if she never had feelings and tried to be honest, maybe not. The question is whether she's in the wrong for breaking up. Since she didn't love him and the relationship was unequal, perhaps she's not in the wrong. But the way she handled it and the power dynamics might make her responsible.\n"
