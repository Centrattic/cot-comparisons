We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 29-year-old woman breaking up with her 20-year-old boyfriend after getting a good job. They had been dating for over a year, and she was financially dependent on him at times. He has Asperger's, and she moved in with him. Now she left because she's financially stable and doesn't love him, and he's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The woman was in a relationship where she admitted she didn't love him as he loved her. She relied on him financially when she was in a lower-paying job and then moved out after getting a better job. The key factors here are her reasons for the breakup, the age difference, and the financial dependency.\n\nShe mentions that the relationship started as casual but he became more attached. She took advantage of his kindness, like moving in with him and accepting gifts. When she got the job, she felt secure and ended the relationship. He's clearly hurt, but she's questioning if she's the asshole.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, people have the right to end relationships that aren't fulfilling for them, especially if there's an imbalance in emotional investment. However, the financial dependency might add complexity. If she was using him during her financial struggles and then left when she stabilized, some might see that as selfish. But others might argue that she had the right to pursue her independence once she could.\n\nThe age gap is another point. A 9-year difference isn't huge, but with him being 20 and her 29, it's possible he was still developing emotionally. If she was aware of his attachment and ended it for her own benefit without considering his emotional state, that could be seen as harsh. However, she did try to console him and even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected.\n\nAlso, the fact that she was in a better position financially now and wanted her own space could be seen as a mature decision. She wasn't staying in a relationship out of obligation but choosing to leave when she was ready. But the question is whether she had a responsibility to stay because he was emotionally reliant on her.\n\nIn terms of \"Am I the Asshole,\" the community often looks at intent and fairness. If she was honest about her feelings and didn't mislead him, then she's not necessarily wrong. However, if there was a sense of manipulation or exploitation, that could tip it the other way. She admitted she didn't love him, which is a valid reason to end a relationship. The fact that she moved in with him and accepted his support while knowing her feelings might complicate things, but it's not clear she was deceptive.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong because she's prioritizing her own well-being and financial independence, and she ended the relationship when she realized it wasn't what she wanted. The answer should be B.\n"
