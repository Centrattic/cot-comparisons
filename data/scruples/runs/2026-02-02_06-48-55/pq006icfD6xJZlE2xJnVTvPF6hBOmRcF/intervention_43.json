We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. \n\nFirst, the situation: She's 29, he's 20. They were dating over a year. She was in a low-income situation, taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. He's 20 with Asperger's, they started a relationship, she moved in with him, and he provided financial support. She didn't love him but broke up after getting a better job, leading to her moving out and saving money. Now he's upset, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here. She's in a relationship where he's providing financial support because she was struggling. Then she gets a better job, becomes more financially stable, and decides to end the relationship. She mentions she doesn't love him like he does. \n\nFrom her perspective, maybe she felt trapped in a relationship where she wasn't emotionally invested, and once she had the means to leave, she did. That seems like a personal choice\u2014choosing herself when she's able. However, she was relying on him financially, and then left once she didn't need that support. That could be seen as using him, especially since he's younger and has Asperger's, which might affect his ability to understand the relationship dynamics. \n\nBut relationships aren't just about financial support. If she wasn't in love and the relationship wasn't fulfilling for her, then ending it isn't inherently wrong. However, the fact that she was using his financial help while not being emotionally committed could be a problem. Also, breaking up after gaining financial stability might come off as self-serving, but if the relationship was already lacking in emotional connection, maybe it's necessary for her to leave.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. The community often looks at intentions. If she was in the relationship for his financial support and then left when she didn't need it, that's one angle. But if the relationship was never based on love from her side, and she's choosing to end it when she can, that's another. \n\nShe did try to console him and even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. That shows she's trying to be considerate, but he's upset. Still, if she wasn't in love and the relationship was unhealthy, maybe she's justified. \n\nBut there's an element of emotional manipulation here. Taking advantage of his situation (his Asperger's, youth, and kindness) to get financial support while not being emotionally committed. That's a red flag. She moved in with him out of a crumbling apartment, and he provided clothes and groceries. Breaking up after becoming financially stable could be seen as using him. \n\nHowever, relationships are complex. If she wasn't in love and the relationship wasn't working, then she's not the asshole for ending it. The problem is whether she used him. But it's possible she was in a situation where she needed support and then chose to leave once she had her own stability. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers whether the person acted selfishly or inconsiderately. Here, she might be seen as acting in her own interest once she had the means, but if the relationship was already not based on mutual love, then it's a valid choice. However, the financial dependency and the emotional impact on him might tip the scales. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because she's not in the wrong for ending a relationship where she wasn't emotionally invested, especially when she had the means to leave. But there's a nuance because of his vulnerability. However, the main issue is whether she's wrong for leaving. Since she wasn't in love and the relationship was unequal, she's not the asshole. So the answer is B.\n"
