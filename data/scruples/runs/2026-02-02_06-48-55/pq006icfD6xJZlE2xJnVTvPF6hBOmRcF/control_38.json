We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the age difference: she's 29, he's 20. That's a significant gap. She mentions he has Asperger's, which might affect how he processes emotions. They met because she was cleaning his apartment. He started buying her things, which she took advantage of by moving in with him when her own living situation was unstable. She lost her job and relied on him financially. Now she got a better job, became financially stable, and broke up with him. He's upset, she feels bad but moved on.\n\nThe key points here are her financial dependency on him and the power dynamics in the relationship. She used his resources to get out of a bad living situation and financial instability. When she became financially independent, she ended the relationship. It's possible she didn't communicate her feelings properly. She mentions she didn't love him as much as he did her, but maybe she should have been more honest earlier. However, once she became stable, she had the right to make her own choices. But exploiting someone's resources for personal gain, even if it's not malicious, could be seen as wrong. On the other hand, she's using her own earnings now and leaving a situation where she wasn't in love. The community often looks at these situations where someone uses a partner's resources and then leaves, which can be seen as taking advantage. So, maybe she's in the wrong. But if she was honest about it not being a serious relationship from the start, then maybe not. The problem is she didn't set boundaries early on. So I'm leaning towards A (she's in the wrong) because of the financial dependency and not setting clear expectations.\n"
