We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nSo, the author is 29, her ex-boyfriend Justin is 20. They dated over a year. She was struggling financially, taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. Justin lives in a luxury condo, she in a low-income area. They started a relationship, he was nice, she moved in with him after losing her job. He supported her with groceries and clothes. She didn't love him as much as he did. She got a good job, saved money, broke up with him. He's upset, she feels bad but moved out.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know what I think. The question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author and Justin had a relationship where he provided financial support because she was in a tough spot. She moved in with him. She didn't love him as much as he did. Then she got a better job, became more financially stable, and decided to break up. She tried to console him but he's still upset. She's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Relationships are supposed to be based on mutual respect and feelings. If one person is in love and the other isn't, that's a problem. The author mentions she didn't love him like he did. That's a valid reason to break up. However, the timing and circumstances might affect the perception. She broke up with him after securing a better job, which he had been supporting her through. Some might argue that she used him for financial stability until she became independent, then left. Others might say it's her right to seek better opportunities and she's not obligated to stay in a relationship where the feelings aren't mutual.\n\nThe age difference is 9 years, which could affect the dynamic. He's 20, she's 29. He has Asperger's, which might mean he has different social or emotional processing. She took his virginity and they started a relationship. She moved in with him when she was in a vulnerable position. Now that she's stable, she ends it. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's not obligated to stay in a relationship if the feelings aren't mutual. But the fact that she relied on his financial support and then left when she could might be seen as using him. But she didn't force him into it; he chose to support her. She tried to console him, even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he refused. \n\nIn terms of moral wrong, if the relationship was consensual and based on mutual agreement at the time, then ending it when the circumstances change isn't necessarily wrong. However, if there were unspoken expectations of long-term commitment that she didn't meet, that could be a problem. The key here is whether there was a clear understanding of the relationship's nature. She didn't mention discussing the seriousness of the relationship. If he expected a long-term commitment and she didn't, that's an issue. But she said she didn't love him, so maybe she never intended a serious relationship. \n\nAlso, moving on after achieving personal goals is a common scenario. People often reassess relationships when their lives change. The question is whether her decision was selfish. She might feel she was prioritizing her own future, which is reasonable. However, the way she handled the breakup and her feelings afterward might affect the perception. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's a possibility of being seen as using him, if the relationship wasn't based on mutual love from the start, then breaking up isn't entirely her fault. But there's a nuance here. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because she's not obligated to stay in a relationship where the feelings aren't mutual. However, some might argue A because of the financial dependency aspect. But given the information, the main issue is the lack of mutual love, which is a valid reason to end a relationship.\n"
