We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is 29, their ex-boyfriend Justin is 20 and has Asperger's. They started dating when the author was cleaning his apartment. The author was in a tough financial situation, moving in with Justin because their apartment was bad. Justin was providing support with groceries, clothes, etc. The author mentions they didn't love Justin like he does, and after getting a better job and saving money, they broke up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had a valid reason to break up. The user says they don't love Justin like he does, which is a common reason for ending a relationship. But Justin was significantly younger and had Asperger's, which might affect how he processes emotions. The age difference is notable too\u20149 years. Also, the author was financially dependent on Justin for a while, which could complicate things. Did the author take advantage of Justin's situation? Or was it mutual support?\n\nThe author broke up when they got a better job, which allowed them to save money. So maybe they felt more secure to leave. But Justin was devastated, and the breakup might have been abrupt. The author tried to console him but he didn't accept. Also, offering a friends-with-benefits arrangement made him angry. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships should be based on mutual feelings. If the author never loved Justin and was using him for financial support, that's a problem. But if they were in a relationship where both contributed, even if the feelings weren't equal, breaking up isn't necessarily wrong. The key is whether the author was honest. The user says they were going to tell him it was strictly casual but didn't because he started to like them. So maybe there was a misrepresentation of intentions from the start. That could be an issue. Also, moving in together while the author knew they didn't have feelings for him might be problematic. \n\nBut the user mentions that Justin bought them things and supported them financially. If the user was taking advantage of Justin's generosity without reciprocating emotional investment, that's not fair. However, Justin is older now (20) but still significantly younger than the user. The age gap and possible power dynamics here might play a role. \n\nIn terms of the breakup itself, the user had a reason to leave once they were financially stable. But if the relationship was built on unequal emotional investment, the user might be at fault for leading Justin on. On the other hand, the user's decision to leave when they had the means to be independent could be seen as responsible. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the user was honest with Justin about their intentions from the start. Since they were going to tell him it was casual but didn't when he showed attachment, that could be seen as deceptive. That would make the user in the wrong. But if the relationship was mutual in some way, even with unequal feelings, breaking up isn't wrong. \n\nI think the key points are the initial intentions, the power imbalance in financial dependence, and the emotional dishonesty. The user might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate their true feelings and might have taken advantage of Justin's situation.\n"
