We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a relationship where the woman broke up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The woman, who's 29, was in a relationship with Justin, 20, for over a year. She was cleaning his apartment and they started dating. Justin has Asperger's and was a sweet but awkward guy. She moved in with him after losing her previous job and relying on his financial support. Now, she got a better-paying job, saved money, and decided to break up. She feels bad but isn't sure if she's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks she's in the wrong but wants another opinion. The options are A for yes (she's wrong) and B for no (she's not).\n\nLooking at the situation, there are a few factors to consider. The age difference is significant\u2014Justin is 20, and she's 29. That might affect the power dynamics. She was financially struggling and moved in with him, which could imply dependency. Justin provided financial support, but she didn't love him as he did. When she became financially stable, she broke up, which left him devastated.\n\nThe question is whether her decision to break up was wrong. From an ethical standpoint, if she was in a relationship without mutual love and decided to end it when she could support herself, is that fair? Or did she take advantage of Justin's kindness and then leave when it suited her?\n\nHowever, relationships are about mutual feelings. If she didn't love him and he was emotionally invested, she might have a responsibility to end it sooner rather than later. But she waited until she had financial security before leaving. That could be seen as using him for support while she could, then leaving once she's stable. That seems exploitative, which would make her the asshole. On the other hand, if she's not in love, she's not obligated to stay, even if it hurts him. Relationships should be based on mutual affection, not just convenience.\n\nAlso, considering Justin's Asperger's, he might struggle more with emotional transitions. But that doesn't justify her staying if there's no love. The key issue is whether her actions were selfish. If she stayed in the relationship not out of love but because she needed financial support, then leaving when she no longer needed it could be seen as abandoning him once she's stable, which is wrong. Alternatively, if the relationship was never based on love from her side, it's better to end it when possible, even if it's painful for him.\n\nIn many cases, people in such situations are criticized for not staying when they were financially dependent. But once they're stable, they can make a choice. However, the fact that she moved in with him and relied on him financially while not being in love might be the problem. So, maybe she's the asshole because she used his financial support during her time of need and then left once she could. But others might argue that she's not obligated to stay in an unloved relationship, regardless of financial factors.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the relationship was built on genuine connection or just convenience. Since the author didn't love him but stayed partly because of financial need, and then left when she could, it's a bit of a gray area. However, given that she initiated the breakup when she was in a better position, and relationships require mutual affection, she might not be in the wrong. But there's a strong argument that she was using him, which makes her the asshole.\n"
