We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a 29-year-old woman breaking up with her 20-year-old boyfriend after getting a better job.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The woman was poor, taking odd jobs, including cleaning. She met Justin, who has Asperger's, while cleaning his condo. They started a relationship, and he supported her financially, even helping her move into his place. She didn't love him but seemed okay with the arrangement. Now she got a good job, saved money, and broke up with him, which he's taking hard. She tried to console him and offered a friends-with-benefits setup, but he was upset.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider relationship ethics here. Justin provided financial support, and the woman moved in with him. The breakup was after she became more financially stable. Is it wrong to end a relationship once your circumstances improve? Or is the issue that she didn't communicate her feelings properly from the start?\n\nThe woman mentions she was going to tell him it was strictly casual but didn't because he started to like her. That's a red flag. If she didn't have romantic feelings, she should have been honest. Instead, she let things progress into a committed relationship, possibly leading him on. Now that she's more stable, she's ending it, which might leave him feeling used or taken advantage of, especially since he's young and maybe not in the same position financially.\n\nAlso, there's a significant age gap. Justin is 20, and the woman is 29. That could bring in power dynamics, especially if she was in a vulnerable financial position. But the core issue here seems to be honesty and communication. If she didn't love him and entered the relationship under the premise of it being casual, but then let it become more serious, that's her fault. Breaking up when her life has improved might be a catalyst, but the root problem is that she wasn't upfront about her intentions. She benefited from his support without reciprocating emotional commitment, which could be seen as manipulative. \n\nSo the answer would be A, she is in the wrong. The main mistake was not being honest about her feelings and intentions from the beginning, leading the relationship to become more than just casual when he was invested. Ending it when her situation improved doesn't justify the lack of communication, especially if he was emotionally attached and relied on her.\n"
