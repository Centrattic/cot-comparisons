We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is she's 29, dating a 20-year-old named Justin. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. She was in a tough financial situation, moving to a gentrified area, and Justin was helping her out with money, groceries, clothes, etc. She moved in with him after losing her job. Then she got a better job, saved money, broke up with him, and now he's upset.\n\nFirst, the age difference is 9 years. Justin is 20, which is a young adult, but still quite a bit younger. She's in her late 20s, which is more established. The power dynamics here might be a factor. Justin was providing financial support when she was in a vulnerable position. She mentions he was kind of her \"meal ticket,\" which suggests a dependency. But she also says she didn't love him as much as he did her. \n\nShe broke up with him after securing a better job and moving out. The key points are consent, manipulation, and whether the breakup was justified. The question is if she's being selfish or if she's making a valid choice based on her own needs and growth. \n\nJustin had Asperger's, which might affect his ability to understand social cues or the relationship's nature. Did she exploit his condition? She had a job that paid well now, so maybe she was in a better position. But moving in with someone who's financially stable when you're in a tough spot could create an imbalanced relationship. \n\nWhen she broke up, she tried to console him and even suggested friends with benefits, which he rejected. Is it fair to break up when one person is more invested? She didn't love him, but he did. That's a common issue in relationships. If the relationship was unequal in emotional investment, maybe she's in the right to end it. However, the financial aspect complicates things. \n\nThe user says they think she's in the wrong, but I need to consider if she manipulated Justin's support. If she was taking advantage of his kindness while she was in a bad job and then left once she was better off, that could be seen as taking advantage. But if the relationship was never based on love and she was honest with herself, maybe it's her right to end it when she found her footing. \n\nAlso, considering Justin's age and Asperger's, maybe he was more vulnerable. Did she have a responsibility to be more honest from the start? She mentions she was going to tell him it was casual but he became attached. If the relationship was initially casual but then he developed feelings, and she didn't reciprocate, that's a problem. \n\nIn terms of ethics, is she being selfish by leaving once she's stable, but if the relationship wasn't genuine, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if she relied on him financially and then left, that's exploitative. The answer might depend on whether the relationship was based on mutual consent and understanding from the beginning. If she was upfront about her intentions, maybe not. If she led him on, then yes. The story isn't clear on whether she was honest about her feelings from the start. She mentions she was going to tell him it was casual but didn't. That could mean she took advantage of his feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because she didn't honor Justin's feelings and used his support during her vulnerable time, then left when she was better off without a clear, mutual understanding. Even if she didn't love him, she should have been honest about her intentions. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, she's in the wrong).\n"
