We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nSo, the author is 29 and her ex-boyfriend Justin is 20. They were dating for over a year. She was in a financial tough spot, taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. She met him through that job. Justin has Asperger's and was awkward at first but turned out to be nice. They had a sexual relationship, and he started treating her well, buying groceries, clothes, a coat. She moved in with him from her crumbling apartment. She lost her cleaning job and had to take a lower-paying one, relying on him. She didn't love him but he had feelings. Now she got a better job, saved money, broke up with him. He's devastated. She tried to console him, even suggested friends with benefits, but he was angry. She moved out and feels bad.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. Answer A or B. So, is she the asshole?\n\nFirst, consider the dynamics. She was in a financial need, moved in with him because her living situation was bad. He was providing for her financially. But their relationship might have been unbalanced. She didn't love him, and broke up when she became more financially stable. \n\nIs there anything unethical about ending a relationship when you're no longer in the same financial situation? People can end relationships for any reason, especially if they don't feel the same level of love. However, there's the aspect of her relying on him financially. But she got a better job now, so maybe she felt it was time to leave. \n\nBut did she have a responsibility to him? Since he's 20 and might be more vulnerable, especially with Asperger's. But age difference is 9 years; she's 29, he's 20. Still, maybe there's an imbalance in maturity. \n\nShe moved in with him out of her crumbling apartment, which suggests she needed the support. Now that she's stable, she leaves. Is that fair? It's not illegal or necessarily unethical. People can leave relationships for their own reasons. However, the fact that she used him financially might be a point. But she didn't have a job at the time, so maybe it was a mutual arrangement. \n\nThe user is asking if she's in the wrong. The key points are: she didn't love him, broke up when she could support herself, and he's upset. She tried to comfort him but he still reacted badly. \n\nIn terms of general moral judgment, people can end relationships without being the \"asshole\" if they're honest. However, if there's a significant power imbalance, maybe she should have been more considerate. But she did breakup and tried to be nice. \n\nAnother angle: did she have a duty of care because he's vulnerable (Asperger's, young)? But that's his own responsibility. Unless she was exploiting him, which isn't clear. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a tough call. She made a choice based on her needs and circumstances. Since she's not staying in a relationship she doesn't want, she's not in the wrong. But some might argue she should have been more thoughtful. However, the general consensus in such situations is that people have the right to end relationships for personal reasons. So answer B (not the asshole).\n"
