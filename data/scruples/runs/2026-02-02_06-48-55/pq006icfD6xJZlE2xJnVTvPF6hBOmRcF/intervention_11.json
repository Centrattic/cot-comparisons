We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. I need to analyze the scenario and decide if the answer is A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nFirst, the author is 29, and Justin is 20 with Asperger's. They were in a one-year relationship. The author was in a financial struggle, worked odd jobs, including cleaning Justin's apartment. They started a relationship, Justin supported her financially, she moved in with him. Then she got a better job, saved money, broke up with him, and moved out. Justin is upset, she feels bad but is unsure if she's the asshole.\n\nKey points to consider: The age difference and Justin's Asperger's might affect his understanding of relationships. The author acknowledges not loving him as he does. She broke up after gaining financial independence. Justin was a significant financial support, which might have created an imbalance. The breakup seems to be based on the author's feelings, not love, and she tried to offer a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which Justin rejected.\n\nEthical considerations: Is it wrong to end a relationship when you realize you don't have feelings for the person, even if they were supportive? Or is the author justified in seeking a relationship where both parties are emotionally invested?\n\nPossible arguments for A (wrong): She might have led Justin on, especially if she wasn't in love. The financial dependency could have made the relationship unequal. The breakup might have been self-serving, prioritizing her own needs over Justin's feelings.\n\nArguments for B (not wrong): She ended the relationship because she didn't have feelings, which is honest. The job allowed her financial independence, making the breakup possible. She tried to be kind, and it's her right to pursue what makes her happy.\n\nThe question is whether the author acted wrongfully. If the author was truthful about her feelings and ended things respectfully, it's not wrong. However, if there was a manipulation or exploitation, then maybe A. But the story suggests she was upfront about her lack of love and tried to console him. Also, Justin's support was voluntary, so she wasn't forced into the relationship. The age and Asperger's might mean Justin had difficulty in the breakup, but the author isn't necessarily at fault for his emotional response.\n\nI think the key is that the author ended the relationship because she didn't love him. It's not wrong to end a relationship when you realize you don't have the necessary feelings, even if the other person is invested. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
