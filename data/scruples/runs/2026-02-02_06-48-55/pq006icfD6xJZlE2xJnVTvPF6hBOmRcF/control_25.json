We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with her boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation is that she was in a one-year relationship with a younger guy named Justin who has Asperger's. She was in a tough financial spot, working odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. They started a relationship, and he supported her financially, even buying her things and letting her move in with him. She didn't love him as much as he did, but when she got a good job and became more financially stable, she broke up with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. Justin is 20, she's 29. There's an age gap, which might mean different life stages. He's providing financial support, which could be a point of contention. She was using his resources, which might not be healthy in the long run. She didn't love him, so the relationship wasn't based on mutual affection. When she got a better job, she felt it was time to leave. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, if the relationship wasn't based on love and she was using him for financial support, then ending it when she's more stable might be seen as her right. However, Justin was emotionally invested and might have felt used. But the key point is that she didn't love him, so the relationship wasn't balanced in terms of emotional investment. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, she did try to maintain some connection after the breakup, but he was upset. She also mentions he was buying her things and giving financial support, which could be seen as enabling or creating dependency. Her moving out after securing a job is practical. \n\nI think the main issue here is whether the relationship was healthy. If it's an imbalance where one person is giving more than the other, and the other is in it for financial reasons, then the breakup isn't necessarily wrong. She's choosing to leave a situation where she wasn't emotionally committed once her circumstances improved. \n\nSo, probably the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong) because the relationship wasn't based on mutual love, and she's making a decision based on her own needs and circumstances now that she's more stable. Justin's financial support was a factor, but she was clear she didn't love him. Ending a relationship where one person is not emotionally committed isn't inherently wrong, even if the other is hurt.\n"
