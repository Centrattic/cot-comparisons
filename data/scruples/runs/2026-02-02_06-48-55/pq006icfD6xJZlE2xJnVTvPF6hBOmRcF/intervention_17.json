We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see, the situation is about a 29-year-old woman breaking up with her 20-year-old boyfriend, Justin, after getting a good job. They had been dating for over a year, and she was cleaning his apartment. Justin has Asperger's and was awkward at first but became a sweetheart. She had moved in with him, and he was helping her out financially because she lost her previous job. Now she's in a better-paying job, built up savings, and broke up with him. Justin is devastated, and she feels bad.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ages. A 29-year-old with a 20-year-old. Justin is still pretty young, maybe in college or just starting his career. The author was in a lower financial situation and moved in with him, perhaps relying on his support. Now that she's more stable, she ends the relationship. The question is whether that makes her the asshole.\n\nThe key points here are the motivation for the breakup and the nature of the relationship. The author mentions she didn't love Justin like he did, but she was taking his virginity and had a sexual relationship. She also says she intended to make it casual but Justin developed feelings. So maybe they were in a relationship where she didn't reciprocate the same level of emotion. Then, when she got a better job and her financial situation improved, she ended things. \n\nSome people might argue that she used Justin for financial support and then left once she didn't need him anymore. That could be seen as selfish. However, the author claims she didn't love him, so maybe she felt like ending the relationship was necessary once her circumstances changed. Justin might have been emotionally invested, which complicates things. \n\nAlso, the part where she suggests friends with benefits after the breakup and Justin getting angry is interesting. If they were in a romantic relationship, making it friends with benefits could be a rejection, but if she never intended to be in a serious relationship, maybe that's part of the problem. \n\nBut the main issue is whether breaking up with him after gaining financial stability is wrong. If the relationship was based on emotional connection and mutual respect, then leaving because she's no longer poor might not be the right reason. However, if she never loved him and the relationship was more transactional, then she's not the asshole. \n\nI should also consider the ethical aspect. Ending a relationship because your financial status changed could be seen as using someone, especially if Justin was emotionally investing in a long-term relationship. The age gap is another factor\u201429 to 20 is a 9-year difference, which some might view as significant. \n\nBut the author says she didn't love him. If that's true, then maybe she's not in the wrong. However, if she led him on and didn't communicate her intentions clearly, that could be an issue. She mentions she was going to tell him it's casual, but he started to like her. So perhaps she didn't set boundaries properly. \n\nIn the end, the question is about whether her financial situation is a valid reason to break up. Since people can change their needs and circumstances, maybe it's understandable. But if the relationship wasn't genuine, then she's the asshole. The answer depends on whether the breakup was primarily due to financial reasons or the lack of love.\n"
