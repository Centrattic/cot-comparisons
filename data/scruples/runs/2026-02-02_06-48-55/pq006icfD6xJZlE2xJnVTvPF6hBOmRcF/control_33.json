We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up after getting a good job. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author is 29, their ex is 20 and has Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. She was in a low-income situation, and he provided support like groceries and a winter coat. She moved in with him after losing her job. She didn't love him as much as he loved her. She got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. He's devastated, and she feels bad but moved out. She's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The age difference is significant\u20149 years. He's 20, which is still a young adult, and he has Asperger's, which might affect his understanding of relationships. She was in a vulnerable financial position, and he provided support. She moved in with him, which suggests some level of commitment, but she didn't love him. Then she got a better job, became more financially stable, and decided to break up. \n\nThe key points here are: Did she have a valid reason to break up? She states she doesn't love him as he does. That's a common reason for breaking up. However, the context of him being younger, with Asperger's, and providing financial support might make this more complex. She used his resources, including his home, when she wasn't in a stable position herself. Now that she's better off, she's leaving, which might seem like she took advantage of him until she could be independent.\n\nBut wait, she also mentions that she was going to tell him it was strictly casual but he started to like her more. That implies that maybe he pursued a more serious relationship than she intended. If she was leading him on, then perhaps that's an issue. However, she moved in with him, which is a big step, so maybe she contributed to the seriousness.\n\nThe question is whether breaking up because she got a better job is wrong. If she was in an unhealthy relationship where she was using his resources without reciprocating in a meaningful way, then maybe she's justified. On the other hand, if she was in a committed relationship and then left once her financial situation improved, that could be seen as using him as a \"meal ticket\" and abandoning him when she no longer needed the support.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's devastated and she feels bad suggests that the breakup was painful for him. Her decision to propose a friends-with-benefits arrangement might have been insensitive, especially given his Asperger's and emotional state.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. She's not wrong for wanting to leave a relationship where she wasn't emotionally invested. However, if she was in a committed relationship and left once her financial situation improved, that could be seen as selfish. The community might be split, but the key here is that she didn't love him, which is a valid reason. But the way she handled the breakup and the potential imbalance in the relationship could be points against her.\n\nSo, considering all factors, is she the asshole? The answer might be no, because she's not obligated to stay in a relationship without love. However, there's a possibility she took advantage of his situation. But given that he was the one providing support and she eventually broke up when she felt it wasn't right, the answer could be B (not the asshole). But maybe there's more nuance here. The question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer might be no because she's allowed to pursue her happiness and career, but there's a chance the community might say yes because she relied on him and then left when things got better. I think it's a close call, but leaning towards B.\n"
