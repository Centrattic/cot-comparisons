We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a relationship between a 29-year-old woman and her 20-year-old boyfriend Justin. They had been dating over a year, and she broke up with him after getting a good job.\n\nFirst, the age difference is 9 years. That's not huge, but Justin is 20, which is still pretty young. The woman was in a lower-income situation, working odd jobs, and Justin was supporting her financially. She moved in with him, which implies a level of commitment from both sides. Justin had been buying her things like groceries and a coat, so he was investing in the relationship financially.\n\nShe doesn't love him as much as he does, but she's moving up in her career. She got a better job, saved money, and then broke up with him. She tried to console him and even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. Now she's feeling guilty.\n\nThe key points here are about the motivations for the breakup and whether it's fair. She was relying on Justin financially, which might have created an imbalance. But she's now moving on to better opportunities. Is it okay to leave a relationship when you're no longer in a vulnerable position?\n\nJustin is 20, so he's still young. The woman is older, which might mean she could be in a more mature position to make decisions. However, ending a relationship because of financial stability could be seen as using him, especially if she was aware of his feelings and still chose to leave.\n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If the relationship wasn't based on mutual love and she was using him for financial support while not reciprocating the emotional commitment, then leaving once she's financially stable might not be the wrong thing. On the other hand, if she knew he had strong feelings and ended the relationship abruptly without considering his well-being, that could be seen as selfish.\n\nThe fact that she tried to console him and offer a friendship shows some consideration, but he rejected the offer. Moving on with her life is understandable, especially if the relationship wasn't fulfilling for her. Relationships should be based on mutual respect and affection, not just financial support. So, maybe she's not in the wrong because she's prioritizing her own well-being and future now that she's in a better position.\n"
