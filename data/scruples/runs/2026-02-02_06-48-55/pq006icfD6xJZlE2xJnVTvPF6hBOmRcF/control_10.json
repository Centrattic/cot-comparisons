We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. The situation involves a 29-year-old woman who was in a relationship with a 20-year-old named Justin. They had been dating over a year, and she was in a lower income situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. Justin has Asperger's, was awkward but sweet, and they ended up having a sexual relationship. She moved in with him, her job with the cleaning company ended, and she relied on him for some support. But she didn't love him the way he loved her. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. Now she's feeling bad because he's devastated.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she was in the wrong. The main points here are about the relationship dynamics, the reasons for the breakup, and whether her actions were justified.\n\nThe user is asking for an opinion on whether the author is at fault. In AITA questions, the community often looks at factors like honesty, respect, and fairness. The author didn't love Justin but allowed the relationship to continue. She moved in with him, accepted gifts, and relied on his financial support. When she got a better job and became more financially stable, she decided to break up. \n\nThe key issues here might be that she didn't communicate her feelings properly. If she knew she didn't love him but was in a committed relationship, that's a problem. She took advantage of his feelings and possibly his financial support without being upfront. However, once she got her own financial stability, she made the decision to leave, which could be seen as her taking control of her life. \n\nBut since the relationship wasn't based on mutual love and she didn't make her intentions clear, she might be at fault. The fact that she considered a friends-with-benefits arrangement after the breakup might have been insensitive, adding to Justin's hurt. However, the breakup itself might be justified if the relationship wasn't healthy or reciprocal. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she entered into a relationship knowing she didn't have feelings for him and led him on, that's a problem. But if the breakup was a result of her becoming more independent and realizing the relationship wasn't right, it's more about self-realization. The community might split, but in AITA scenarios, often people are called out for not being honest or for taking advantage. Here, the author might be seen as using Justin during a tough time and then leaving once she could. On the other hand, she's taking charge of her life and career. \n\nThe answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because she's prioritizing her own life and independence, but the way she handled the relationship could be seen as leading him on. However, since the relationship wasn't based on love and she's now making her own way, it's more about her growth. I think the community might lean towards her not being the asshole because she's taking control of her life, even if the breakup was harsh. So, the answer is B.\n"
