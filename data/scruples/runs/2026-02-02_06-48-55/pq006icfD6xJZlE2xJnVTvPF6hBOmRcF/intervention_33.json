We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. I need to figure out if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe person is 29, their ex is 20. They dated over a year. The author was in a bad financial situation, taking odd jobs, including cleaning apartments. They met the boyfriend while cleaning his apartment. He has Asperger's, was awkward but sweet. They had a physical relationship, and the boyfriend started treating them well, buying groceries, clothes, a coat, and they moved in with him. The author lost their job at the cleaning company and had to get a lower-paying one, so they were relying on him financially. They didn't love him but started a relationship. Now the author got a better job, saved money, broke up, and the ex is upset. The author feels bad but moved out.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to decide.\n\nFirst, the relationship dynamics. The author was in a situation where they were economically dependent on the boyfriend. The boyfriend was giving financial support, which might have created an imbalance. The author didn't love the boyfriend but was in a relationship. The breakup happened after the author became financially stable. \n\nBut is it wrong to end a relationship when you no longer need the other person financially? Or is it about the emotional aspect? The boyfriend has Asperger's and might have trouble with relationships. The author might have taken advantage of his kindness and financial support. However, the author also mentions they tried to console him and offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. \n\nThe key points here: Did the author have a valid reason to break up? The author's main reason was moving on and not loving him. The fact that the author got a better job might be a factor in their decision, but is that a valid reason? If the author was in an unequal relationship where they were dependent, and now they are independent, maybe they felt it's time to end it. However, the author also didn't love him, which is a valid reason to break up. \n\nBut the boyfriend might have felt used, especially if he was emotionally invested and the author was using him for financial support. However, the author wasn't necessarily using him; they might have genuinely been in a relationship but didn't have romantic feelings. The boyfriend might have been in a relationship where he was giving more in terms of money, and the author was giving companionship and emotional support (though not love). \n\nIs it wrong to end a relationship when you no longer need the other person financially? It depends on the circumstances. If the relationship was based on the author's financial need, then the author might be using the boyfriend. But the author states they didn't love him, which is a reason to break up. The boyfriend, however, was emotionally invested and was providing support. The author's decision could be seen as taking advantage of the boyfriend's resources while not reciprocating emotional commitment. \n\nHowever, the author did stay in the relationship for over a year, which suggests some level of commitment. But the question is whether the breakup is justified. If the author didn't love the boyfriend, then ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. The problem might be how the breakup was handled. The author tried to console him, but the boyfriend was devastated. The author might feel bad, but is that enough to say they're in the wrong? \n\nThe Asperger's aspect complicates things. People with Asperger's may have difficulty with social interactions and forming relationships. The boyfriend might have been more emotionally invested than the author, which could lead to an imbalanced relationship. The author might have been in a better position to make the decision to end the relationship when they felt it was right, especially if they didn't have feelings for him. \n\nBut some might argue that the author should have considered the boyfriend's emotional state more, especially given his Asperger's. However, the author did try to console him and even offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. The author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship they don't want to be in. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's decision might be seen as breaking the heart of the boyfriend, especially since he was financially supporting them, the author's lack of love and the newfound financial independence could be valid reasons to end the relationship. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
