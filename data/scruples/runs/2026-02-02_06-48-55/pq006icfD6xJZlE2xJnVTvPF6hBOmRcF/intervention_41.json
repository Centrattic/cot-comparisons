We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with her boyfriend is in the wrong. Let me look at the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the woman, who's 29, was in a relationship with Justin, 20, who has Aspergers. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. She took his virginity, and they started dating. Justin provided her with financial support\u2014groceries, clothes, a coat, and she even moved in with him. She admits she didn't love him as much as he did. Then she got a good job, saved money, and decided to break up. She tried to console him, offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, but he was upset. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, considering the facts: The woman was in a relationship where Justin was providing financial support, and she was relying on him. When she got a better job and became more financially stable, she decided to end the relationship. The key issue here is whether she's in the wrong for breaking up because she's now financially secure.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, breaking up because you're no longer in need isn't inherently wrong. People's circumstances change, and that can affect relationships. However, the way she handled it might be questionable. She mentions that Justin was emotionally dependent and that she didn't love him as much. The fact that she used the financial situation to justify the breakup could be seen as using him, especially if the relationship wasn't based on mutual affection. She also offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which Justin rejected, showing that her actions were perhaps dismissive of his feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, she's not obligated to stay in a relationship where she doesn't feel the same level of love. If the relationship was unequal in terms of emotional investment, she's not necessarily wrong for ending it. However, the fact that she relied on his financial help and then left when she no longer needed it might make her seem self-serving. The age gap and power dynamic could also play a role here\u2014Justin being younger and more vulnerable, especially with Aspergers, might make her decision more ethically questionable.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the woman is in the wrong because she used Justin's financial support while not reciprocating genuine affection, and ended the relationship once she became financially stable, which could be seen as taking advantage of his emotional state and vulnerability. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
