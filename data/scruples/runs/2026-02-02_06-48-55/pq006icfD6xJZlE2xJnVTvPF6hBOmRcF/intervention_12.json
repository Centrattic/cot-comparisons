We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a relationship where a 29-year-old woman breaks up with her 20-year-old boyfriend after getting a better job. He had been supporting her financially, and she ended the relationship once she became more stable. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The boyfriend has Asperger's, which might affect how he processes emotions and relationships. The author moved in with him, relied on his financial support after losing a job, and then decided to break up when she got a better job. She doesn't love him but he loved her.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, the main issue is whether it's fair to end the relationship because of improved financial status. The author might feel that the relationship wasn't based on mutual love, but the boyfriend sees it as more committed. The fact that he provided for her financially could be a point of contention\u2014did she take advantage of him? Or is it normal that once her situation changed, the relationship became untenable?\n\nAlso, the age difference is significant. Justin is 20, so he's a minor in some places, but the question is about moral responsibility. The author moved in with him and relied on his support, which might have been a power imbalance. When she left, she did it for her own betterment, but the sudden breakup without considering his feelings could be seen as selfish.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that she wasn't in love and that the relationship wasn't sustainable long-term. She made a decision based on her own needs and future. However, breaking up because of her success might be seen as using him, especially if he was emotionally invested.\n\nConsidering the \"Am I the Asshole?\" style, the community often looks at intent and fairness. If the author was honest about her intentions from the start, maybe it's different. But she mentioned she was going to make it casual but didn't. She took advantage of his kindness and support, then left when her circumstances improved. That could be seen as the asshole move because she didn't consider his feelings and his reliance on the relationship.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she ended the relationship for self-serving reasons without regard for the other person's emotional state and the support he provided.\n"
