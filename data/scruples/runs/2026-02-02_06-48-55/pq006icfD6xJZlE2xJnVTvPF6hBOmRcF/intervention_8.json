We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're the asshole for breaking up with their boyfriend after getting a good job. The situation is a bit complex. They were dating for over a year, and there's a significant age gap. The author was in a lower economic situation and had been working odd jobs, including cleaning apartments. They met Justin, who's 20 and lives in a luxury condo, through that job. Justin has Asperger's and was described as a sweetheart but maybe not emotionally perceptive.\n\nThe author mentioned that Justin was a \"meal ticket\" because they lost their previous job and had to take a lower-paying one. So they moved in with him, and he provided financial support. The author didn't love him but didn't set clear boundaries, maybe leading to a situation where the relationship was more transactional. Then, when the author got a better job, they broke up, moved out, and now feel bad but is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, it's about honesty and communication. The author didn't love Justin but stayed in the relationship for financial reasons. Once their financial situation improved, they ended the relationship. That could be seen as using someone, even if the author didn't realize it at first. Justin might have developed feelings, expecting a more committed relationship, while the author was only there for support. Breaking up when their needs changed might be seen as self-serving without considering Justin's emotional investment.\n\nHowever, the author might argue they had no other option and needed to focus on their own future. But the key issue here is whether they were honest about their intentions from the start. If they misled Justin about the relationship's nature, that could make them the asshole. If they were upfront, maybe it's less clear. But the author says they were going to tell him it was casual but didn't because Justin started to like them more. That suggests they might have led him on, which is problematic. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate their true intentions and used Justin when they couldn't support themselves, then left when they could.\n"
