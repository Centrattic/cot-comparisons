We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who is 29, was dating a 20-year-old named Justin for over a year. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. Justin has Asperger's and was a virgin, which she took. They started living together, and she lost her job, relying on him for support. Now she got a better job, saved money, moved out, and broke up with him. She's feeling bad but the question is whether she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, age difference. There's a nine-year gap. Justin is 20, so in some contexts, that might be seen as him being a teenager or just an adult. However, he has Asperger's, which might affect his maturity. The author was in a relationship with someone younger, who was emotionally and possibly financially supporting her. That's a big red flag for some people. It might be seen as exploiting a younger person, especially when she had financial struggles and moved in with him because of that.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the relationship dynamics. She mentions that Justin was buying her groceries, a coat, etc. So it sounds like he was the one providing financially while she was unemployed. Then she got a better job, became more financially stable, and broke up with him. The breakup was because she got a good job, which might imply that the relationship wasn't based on equal footing. She might have been taking advantage of his financial support while he was emotionally invested. Now that she's more stable, she left. Some might argue that she was using him for support without reciprocal commitment.\n\nShe tried to console him but he was devastated. She offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. It's possible that Justin was emotionally attached and felt betrayed. The author's decision to break up might be seen as self-serving, prioritizing her own needs over his feelings. However, she might feel that she didn't love him and that they weren't a good match.\n\nThe key points are the power imbalance (her financial reliance on Justin, his age and possible immaturity due to Asperger's), and the timing of the breakup when she became financially stable. Some might argue that she was in a position where she benefited from the relationship's support and then left when it no longer served her. Others might say it's her right to pursue her own happiness and stability, even if it means ending the relationship.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if the relationship was unequal with her relying on his resources, then ending it when she no longer needs those resources could be seen as selfish. But if the relationship was never meant to be long-term and she's honest about her feelings, then it's her choice. The question is whether the way she ended it, considering the circumstances, was wrong. The fact that she felt bad afterward might indicate guilt, but that's not the same as being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering the power dynamics and potential exploitation, especially with Justin's age and her relying on his financial support, the author might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
