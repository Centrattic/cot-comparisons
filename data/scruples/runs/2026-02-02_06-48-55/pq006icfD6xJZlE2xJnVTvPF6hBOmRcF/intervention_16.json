We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with her boyfriend after getting a job is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the woman is 29, the boyfriend is 20 and has Asperger's. They were dating for over a year. She was poor, working odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. She mentions moving in with him because her apartment was bad. Justin paid for groceries, clothes, etc., and she lost her previous job, so she relied on him financially. She didn't love him but he loved her. She got a good job, saved money, and broke up with him. He's upset, and she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. She was in a relationship where there was a significant age gap and possibly an imbalance in emotional investment. She states she didn't love him but he did. The breakup happened after she became financially stable through her new job. \n\nThe key points are: she left when she became more stable, not before. She didn't force him into a relationship but broke up when her circumstances improved. Justin was providing financial support, but she wasn't reciprocating emotionally. She tried to explain and even suggested a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. \n\nIs it fair to leave after securing better financial status? Some might argue she used him as a financial crutch, but others might see her improving her life. However, relationships should be based on mutual affection, not just convenience. Since she admits she doesn't love him, continuing the relationship could be seen as unfair to him. Breaking up when she's better off allows her to pursue her own future, which isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of how they ended the relationship. She moved out, and he's devastated. She tried to console him but he's still upset. The question is whether she's the asshole. In relationships, if you're not in love, staying might be emotionally harmful. Ending it when you can is responsible. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. But the financial dependency might add complexity. However, she didn't take advantage intentionally; she was in a difficult situation and he helped her. When her situation improved, leaving isn't exploitation but self-preservation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's prioritizing her own well-being and future now that she's stable. However, some might argue she should have considered Justin's feelings more. But since she tried to explain and he was already emotionally invested, it's a tough call. Ultimately, she's not in the wrong.\n"
