We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. The situation involves a significant age difference (29 vs. 20) and a relationship where the author was financially struggling and moving in with Justin, who was providing financial support. She later gets a good job, becomes more financially stable, and breaks up with him.\n\nFirst, the age gap is notable. Justin is 20, which is quite young, and he has Asperger's, which might affect how he processes relationships and emotions. The author mentions that Justin took her virginity and was buying her things, which could indicate that he was investing a lot emotionally and financially. The author, on the other hand, wasn't in love with him and left when she became financially stable.\n\nThe key points here are consent, emotional maturity, and whether the breakup was justified. The author didn't force the relationship; she was in a situation where she was financially dependent and later became independent. Breaking up when she feels it's right isn't inherently wrong. However, Justin's age and Asperger's might mean he was more vulnerable or didn't fully understand the relationship's dynamics. The author could be criticized for leading him on if she didn't have romantic feelings, but she did break up and tried to console him. \n\nAlso, the fact that she moved in with him while not being in love raises questions about her intentions. But once she got a good job, she chose to leave, which is her right. The question is whether she's exploiting a vulnerable person or making a personal choice for her well-being. Since she's honest about not loving him and left when her situation changed, it's more about personal decisions than wrongdoing. So the answer is B.\n"
