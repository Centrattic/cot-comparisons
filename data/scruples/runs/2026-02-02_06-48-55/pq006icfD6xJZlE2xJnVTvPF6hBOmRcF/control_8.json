We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for breaking up with their boyfriend after getting a better job. The key points here are the age difference, the power dynamics in the relationship, and the reasons for the breakup.\n\nFirst, the age gap is 9 years. The boyfriend is 20, which is legally an adult, but there's a significant difference in maturity levels. The user mentions that Justin had Asperger's and was awkward at first, which might affect his ability to understand or handle the breakup. The user was in a lower income situation initially and moved in with Justin because of his financial stability. That could imply a dependency on him for housing and expenses. \n\nThen, the user got a better job, saved money, and decided to move out and break up. They tried to console Justin and even suggested a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. The user feels some guilt, but the question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nThe main ethical considerations here are consent, mutual respect, and the nature of the relationship. The user was in a relationship where there might have been unequal power dynamics\u2014Justin providing financial support while the user was in a lower income situation. If the user felt that the relationship wasn't meeting their emotional needs or if they wanted to move on for personal growth, that's their right. However, Justin's emotional response and his condition (Asperger's) might mean he needed more support or clearer communication. \n\nBut the user did try to console him and offered to stay friends. The breakup itself isn't inherently wrong if the user felt it was necessary for their own well-being. The fact that the user was in a better financial position after getting a job might have changed the dynamics, but breaking up because you've improved your life doesn't make you the asshole. People have the right to make decisions that prioritize their own happiness and growth, even if it's hard on the other person, especially if the feelings aren't mutual. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They made a decision based on their own circumstances and future, and while it hurt Justin, it's not unethical if done with honesty and consideration.\n"
