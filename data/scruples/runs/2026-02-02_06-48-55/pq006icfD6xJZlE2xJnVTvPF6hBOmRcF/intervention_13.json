We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. So first, I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nThe author is 29, her ex Justin is 20. They dated over a year. She was in a low-income situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning. She met Justin while cleaning his apartment. He has Asperger's, was awkward but sweet. They started a relationship, and he supported her financially after she lost her job. She moved in with him. But she doesn't love him as much as he does. Then she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the age difference, financial dependency, emotional dynamics, and the reason for the breakup. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the age gap is significant\u20149 years. Justin is 20, which is still young, and she's 29. That might play into power dynamics, especially since she was financially dependent on him at one point. But then she got a better job and became more financially stable, which probably shifted the dynamics.\n\nShe mentions that Justin was buying her things, groceries, clothes, a coat, and she moved in with him. So he was providing financial support when she needed it. However, she doesn't love him and the relationship might have been lopsided. She had to get a lower-paying job, so maybe she was in a vulnerable position. \n\nThe breakup happened after she got a good job. She says she doesn't love him but he does love her. She tried to console him, offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which made him angry. She feels bad but maybe she felt the relationship was unsustainable now that she's more financially stable. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? From an ethical standpoint, breaking up isn't inherently wrong unless there's betrayal or harm. But there are some factors here. She was financially dependent on him, and he had Asperger's, which might affect his ability to understand social cues or emotional nuances. She might have been taking advantage of his kindness when she was in need. Then, once she's stable, she ends the relationship. That could be seen as using him for financial support and then leaving when she no longer needed it. \n\nBut another angle is that she's responsible for her own well-being. If she was in a situation where she couldn't support herself and accepted help, that's not necessarily wrong. But if the relationship was based on her needing financial support and she ended it once she didn't need that anymore, it might be seen as selfish. However, she did try to explain and offer friendship, which shows some consideration. \n\nAlso, the fact that she was the one who initiated the breakup because she doesn't love him\u2014choosing to end a relationship where her feelings aren't mutual is generally acceptable. But the way she ended it and the fact that she used his support when she needed it might complicate things. \n\nIn terms of age and Asperger's, he might have had difficulty recognizing that she wasn't emotionally invested, which could mean she didn't make her intentions clear. If she was honest from the start about her feelings, maybe it's different. But she says she was going to tell him it was casual but he got too attached. So maybe she didn't set clear boundaries early on, leading to his emotional investment, and then she ended it when her circumstances changed. \n\nSo, is she the asshole? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, she's taking a step up in her life and ending a relationship that wasn't fulfilling for her. On the other, she might have led him on or not been honest about her feelings, especially when he was providing financial support. Also, considering his Asperger's, he might not have the same emotional understanding, making it harder for him to realize she's not as invested. \n\nI think there are valid arguments both ways. But since the user thinks she is in the wrong, maybe because she used him and then left, the answer might lean towards A. However, others might say she's not in the wrong because she's pursuing her own happiness and the relationship wasn't healthy. But the key here is the financial dependency and the potential exploitation. If she accepted his support knowing she didn't love him, that's a problem. So the answer is probably A.\n"
