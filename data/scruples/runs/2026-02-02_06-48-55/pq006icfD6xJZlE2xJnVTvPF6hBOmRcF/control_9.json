We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong after breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes, she's in the wrong) or B (no, she's not).\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The woman is 29, her boyfriend Justin is 20. They were dating over a year. She was in a low-income situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. Justin lives in a luxury condo because of gentrification. They met through her job, and she ended up moving in with him after losing her job. She mentions that Justin was buying her groceries and a coat, so he was financially supporting her. However, she doesn't love him the way he does. Then she got a good job, saved money, and broke up with him, leading to his devastation.\n\nThe key points here: the relationship might have been imbalanced. She was financially dependent on him at one point, then after becoming more stable, she left. The question is whether her actions were in the wrong.\n\nIn relationships, emotional and financial dependency can complicate things. If she was using him for financial support and then left once she was stable, some might see that as unfair. However, if she never intended to be in a long-term relationship and only realized after getting her job that she didn't love him, maybe it's her right to end it. But the fact that she moved in with him, accepted his support, and then left when she could support herself might lead people to think she's being selfish. On the other hand, everyone has the right to end a relationship if they're not in love. But the way she left\u2014saying it's strictly casual, then trying to be friends with benefits\u2014could be seen as dismissive. She might have known he had feelings for her and didn't take them seriously. So, is she in the wrong? It might depend on the intentions and how honest she was with him. If she didn't clearly communicate her lack of love and led him on, then yes, she's in the wrong. If she tried to be honest but he was in denial, maybe not. The story says she tried to tell him it was casual but he started liking her more. Then she moved in with him, which could imply a more committed relationship. Breaking up after becoming financially stable might be seen as using him, hence AITA. But since she's being honest about her feelings now, maybe not. The answer is likely A because she's leaving after using him for support and not reciprocating his feelings, but it's a close call. The community usually leans towards A in such cases where there's financial dependency and a one-sided relationship."
