We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author is 29, her ex is 20 and has Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. He was a good provider, giving her clothes, a coat, and they moved in together. She didn't love him but was dependent on him financially. Then she got a better job, became financially stable, and broke up with him. Now he's devastated, and she's feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. She was in a relationship where she was financially dependent on him. He was younger, had Asperger's, which might affect his understanding of relationships. She moved in with him out of her crumbling apartment. Then, when she got a good job, she broke up, possibly because she became financially independent. She tried to console him but he was upset.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, breaking up isn't inherently wrong, but the circumstances matter. She was in a relationship where she wasn't in love, but she was using him financially. When she became financially stable, she ended the relationship. That could be seen as using him. Also, he's 20 and likely not at the same life stage as her. She might have taken advantage of his kindness and support while she built her career, then left when things changed. \n\nOn the other hand, she wasn't lying about her feelings from the start. She mentioned she didn't love him but was maybe using him for support. But she also received a lot from him. The age difference is significant, and his Asperger's might make him more vulnerable. She moved out and he's struggling, so maybe she didn't consider the emotional impact on him. \n\nHowever, she did try to be understanding and even suggested a friends-with-benefits, which he rejected. So maybe she's trying to be fair. But the main issue is whether she was in a reciprocal relationship or exploiting his support. If she was in a relationship not based on mutual feelings but dependency, and then ended it once she became independent, that's a problem. \n\nI think the key point is that she was using him while she was dependent and then left when she didn't need him. That's not okay. So she's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
