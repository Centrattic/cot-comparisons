We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup after getting a better job. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 29, and Justin is 20. They were dating over a year. The author was in a low-income situation, taking odd jobs, including cleaning Justin's apartment. Justin lives in a luxury condo, while the author was in a crumbling apartment. They started a relationship, and Justin provided financial support\u2014groceries, clothes, a winter coat, and the author moved in with him after losing her job. The author doesn't love Justin as he does her. She gets a better-paying job, saves money, and breaks up with Justin, who is devastated. She tried to stay friends but it didn't work. Now she's moving out and feels bad.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider the key points. The relationship was unequal in terms of financial support. Justin was providing for her needs, but she wasn't in love. When she became more financially stable, she ended the relationship. \n\nIn relationships, emotional connection and mutual respect are important. If there's no love, but one person is dependent on the other for support, that can be problematic. However, the author felt the need to end it when she could support herself. \n\nJustin's age (20) vs. the author's age (29) might be a factor. If Justin was emotionally immature, maybe the relationship wasn't balanced. Also, the fact that she took his virginity and he was giving her things he couldn't afford? Wait, no\u2014the author says Justin was buying her groceries and clothes because he liked her, but he's in a luxury condo. Maybe he could afford it. \n\nThe author moved in with him after losing her job, so she had financial dependency. When she got a better job, she broke up. Is that selfish? Or is it about self-respect and independence? Breaking up because you no longer need the relationship might not be the author's fault. However, the way she ended it\u2014suddenly moving out after a year, not being honest about her feelings earlier\u2014could be an issue. \n\nThe author mentions she didn't love him like he did. If she knew she wasn't in love, maybe she should have ended it earlier. But she stayed because of financial reasons. Now that she's stable, she leaves. Is that fair? Or is it her right to prioritize her own needs?\n\nAlso, Justin's reaction\u2014devastated, angry at the friends-with-benefits offer\u2014shows he was emotionally invested. The author might have been using him for support, then left when she could. But maybe she had no choice but to take the job. \n\nIn terms of ethics, people have the right to leave relationships that aren't fulfilling. However, the author might have been taking advantage of Justin's generosity. But she didn't lie about her feelings; she just didn't love him. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether ending a relationship when your circumstances change is wrong. If the relationship was built on unequal terms (financial support from Justin, emotional support from the author) and the author wasn't in love, then leaving when the financial situation improves might not be the author's fault. However, she should have been honest about her feelings earlier. But since the question is about being in the wrong, if the relationship was never based on mutual love, then the author isn't necessarily at fault for ending it when she could.\n"
