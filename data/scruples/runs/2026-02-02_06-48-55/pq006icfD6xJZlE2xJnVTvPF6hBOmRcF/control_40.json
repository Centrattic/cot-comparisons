We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me look at the details.\n\nFirst, the age difference is significant: she's 29, he's 20. That might play into power dynamics. She was in a financial situation where she was struggling, and Justin provided support\u2014groceries, clothes, a place to live. She moved in with him after her apartment was bad. Then she lost her job and got a lower-paying one, so maybe she was dependent on him financially. \n\nShe mentions she didn't love him as much as he loved her. That's a key point. Emotional imbalance in relationships can be a reason to leave. But she used the new job as the catalyst. She broke up when she got the good job, which allowed her to save money and move out. \n\nThe question is whether she's the asshole. The main factors here are: Was the breakup justified? Did she have the right to leave when she did? She didn't love him, which is a valid reason. However, she relied on him financially, and then left when she could support herself. That might make people view her as using him. But others might see it as her finding her independence. \n\nAlso, Justin has Asperger's, which might affect his ability to handle the breakup emotionally. She tried to console him but he was devastated. The friends-with-benefits offer might have been a mistake, causing more hurt. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if she felt the relationship wasn't genuine. But the way she left might come off as selfish, especially if she was taking advantage of his support. However, since she didn't realize her feelings were different and used the job as a catalyst for independence, it's more of a gray area. \n\nI think the key here is that she didn't love him, which is a valid reason to end a relationship. The fact that she left when she could support herself is more about her personal growth. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
