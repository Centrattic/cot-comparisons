We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario is about breaking up with a boyfriend after getting a good job. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the woman is 29 and her ex is 20. They'd been dating over a year. She was in a financial struggle, doing odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. Justin has Asperger's, starts off awkward but is sweet. They had sex, and she didn't initially plan a romantic relationship but he started buying her things, and she moved in with him. She mentions he was her \"meal ticket,\" implying she relied on him financially after losing her job. Then she gets a better job, saves money, and breaks up with him. He's upset, she feels bad but moved on.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's analyze. In relationships, honesty and communication are key. She didn't tell him earlier that it was strictly casual, which might have set expectations. But when he started investing more (gifts, moving in), maybe she should have communicated her feelings. However, she realized she doesn't love him as he does. When she gets a job, she's no longer financially dependent, which could affect the relationship's balance. Breaking up when she's more stable might be seen as self-centered, but she might feel she can't be in a relationship without love. Justin's age difference (20 vs. 29) could imply a power dynamic, especially if she's more experienced and he's younger. Also, considering his Asperger's, maybe he's more vulnerable, and she took advantage of that. On the flip side, she was in a tough spot financially and he supported her. But she broke up when she could be more independent. Is it fair to end things when you're no longer reliant on the person? It's a bit of a gray area. Some might say she should have been honest from the start about her feelings, while others might see it as her finding stability and realizing the relationship wasn't right. The fact that she tried to console him and offer friendship shows she cares, but he didn't take it well. Ultimately, whether she's in the wrong depends on perspective. But since she's choosing herself and her financial independence over a relationship that wasn't based on mutual love, maybe it's not her fault. However, the lack of communication about the relationship's nature might be her fault. Hmm.\n"
