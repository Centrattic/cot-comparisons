We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a better job. The situation involves a significant age gap (29 vs. 20), the author had been in a lower income situation, and the boyfriend provided financial support. She moved in with him, but she didn't love him as much as he loved her. Then she got a good job, saved money, and broke up with him. He's upset and she feels bad.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics. The relationship might have been unequal in terms of financial support. Justin was providing for her needs, which could indicate a dependency. The author might have felt obligated or maybe she wasn't fully committed. Then, when she became more financially stable, she decided to leave. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, people can end relationships for any reason they feel is right. The question is whether her reasons are valid. She doesn't love him, and she's now able to support herself. That seems like a personal choice. However, the fact that she moved in with him after he provided support might make the breakup seem abrupt or selfish, especially if he was emotionally invested. \n\nBut considering that she didn't love him and was using the financial support, it's understandable that she'd leave once she's independent. The problem is whether she was honest about her feelings earlier. Did she lead him on, or was it clear from the start? She mentioned she was going to tell him it was casual but he started to like her. So maybe she didn't set clear boundaries. That could be a point against her. \n\nAlso, the age difference and his Asperger's might mean he had difficulty understanding the relationship's nature. If she didn't communicate her feelings properly, that's on her. But once she got the job and decided to leave, that's her choice. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's more about whether her actions were reasonable. She's not obligated to stay in a relationship she's not in love with, even if it's comfortable. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But the way she handled it\u2014breaking up suddenly after moving in together, not being clear about her feelings\u2014could make her the asshole. \n\nHmm. The key points: she didn't love him, she left when she was able to be independent, but didn't set clear expectations earlier. The answer might hinge on whether her actions were honest. If she knew she didn't love him and stayed for his support, that's one thing. But if she was honest about her feelings, even if it was after some time, maybe it's okay. The community often sees leaving for personal reasons as okay, but leading someone on without clear communication is not. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (Not the asshole) because she's making a choice to leave a relationship she's not in love with once she's financially stable. It's not her fault for wanting to be in a relationship where she has mutual feelings. However, not setting boundaries earlier could be a point, but the main issue is her right to leave. So the answer is B.\n"
