We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a relationship between a 29-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man named Justin. They had been dating for over a year, and the woman recently broke up with him after getting a better job. Now, she's feeling guilty and wants to know if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The age difference is significant\u20149 years. Justin has Asperger's, which might affect how he processes emotions and relationships. The woman was in a lower-income situation and moved in with Justin, who was financially better off. She mentions that he was buying her groceries and clothes, and she lost her job, relying on him financially. She didn't love him but was in a relationship. Then she got a good job, saved money, and decided to break up. She tried to console him and even suggested a friends-with-benefits arrangement, but he was upset.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The woman was in a relationship where she wasn't in love, but was receiving financial support. When her financial situation improved, she decided to leave. Is that wrong? Well, people can't be expected to stay in a relationship if they don't love someone, especially if their circumstances change. However, the age gap and Justin's Asperger's might make him more vulnerable. The woman knew he had feelings for her, and she might have led him on, especially since she had sex with him and moved in together. She didn't set boundaries early on, which could be a problem.\n\nBut on the other hand, it's also her right to pursue her own happiness and career. The fact that she felt she didn't love him and chose to leave when she was financially stable might be justified. However, the way she left might be an issue. She tried to comfort him, but the friends-with-benefits idea could have been hurtful. Also, the power dynamic with him providing financial support might have made the relationship unequal.\n\nIn terms of the Asker's perspective, she's conflicted because she feels bad about Justin's devastation. The community usually looks at these situations based on intent and fairness. If she was honest about her feelings from the start, maybe it's different. But she didn't tell him it was strictly casual and instead let things progress. That could be seen as leading him on, which would make her at least partially at fault.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: she didn't love him, left when her circumstances improved, but didn't set clear boundaries early. The answer might be that she's not entirely in the wrong, but there are aspects where she could have been more considerate. However, the community often sides with people who make life-changing decisions for themselves, even if it's hard on the other person. So maybe B (No) is the answer, but with a note that she could have handled it better.\n"
