We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the woman is 29, the boyfriend is 20. They were together for over a year. She was in a financial struggle, taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. He has Asperger's, was awkward but a sweetheart. They had a physical relationship, he started buying her things, she moved in with him. She lost her cleaning job and had to take a lower-paying one. Then she got a good job, saved money, broke up with him. He was devastated, she tried to console him, suggested friends with benefits, which he refused. She moved out and feels bad.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. She might have been relying on him financially when she was in a lower-paying job. He was buying her groceries, clothes, a coat. That's a significant support. But when she got a better job, she felt she could leave. The age difference is 9 years, which might affect maturity levels. He's 20, so still young, and with Asperger's, which can impact his ability to process emotions or relationships. She says she doesn't love him as he does her. Breaking up because of personal growth or financial stability isn't inherently wrong. However, the emotional impact on him is a factor. She tried to console him, but he's still upset. The question is whether she acted unethically.\n\nIn some perspectives, she's prioritizing her own needs and moving forward, which is understandable. But since he was providing financial support and she was depending on it, leaving after she's financially stable could be seen as fair. However, the way the breakup was handled and the fact that he's emotionally affected might make others question her responsibility towards him. Also, the fact that she took his virginity and he was deeply attached might imply some level of commitment. But she didn't return those feelings. \n\nIn relationships, love and commitment are crucial. If the relationship was unbalanced with her depending on his financial support while not reciprocating emotionally, maybe she's justified in leaving when she's able. However, the sudden breakup without considering his emotional state could be seen as harsh. But the key point is that she's not in the wrong because she's acting in her own self-interest when she can. The answer would depend on whether the relationship was healthy and mutual. Since she didn't love him, breaking up isn't necessarily the wrong choice, even if it harms his feelings. So the answer might be B, she's not the asshole.\n"
