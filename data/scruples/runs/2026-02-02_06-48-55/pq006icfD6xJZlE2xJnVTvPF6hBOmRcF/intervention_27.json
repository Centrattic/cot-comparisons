We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a relationship where the author, who's 29, broke up with her 20-year-old boyfriend, Justin, after securing a better job. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the age difference is significant\u2014nine years. Justin is 20, which is still considered young, and he has Asperger's, which might affect his emotional maturity and processing. The author met Justin through her job, had a casual relationship that became more serious, and Justin provided financial support when she was struggling. However, she didn't love him the same way, and after getting a better job, she broke up, leaving him devastated.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she didn't love him, and she felt the relationship was one-sided. She acknowledges Justin's kindness but states her own feelings weren't reciprocated. However, the breakup was sudden, and she tried to offer a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. She's now feeling guilty.\n\nNow, considering the factors: the age gap might be a red flag, but age alone doesn't determine right or wrong. The power dynamic here is important. Justin was financially supporting her when she was in a low point. Now that she's stable, ending the relationship could be seen as taking advantage of his support. Also, the fact that he's younger and has Asperger's might mean he had a harder time processing the breakup or adjusting to the loss.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she's honest about not loving him and ending a relationship that wasn't fulfilling for her. On the other hand, using his financial support during a vulnerable time and then breaking up when she's stable could be seen as exploiting the situation. The suddenness and the fact that he's clearly hurt might add to the guilt.\n\nThe user thinks she's in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. Ethically, if you enter a relationship knowing it's not genuine and then leave when better circumstances arise, that could be considered selfish. But if the relationship was never based on love and she's ending something that wasn't right, maybe she's justified. However, the financial dependency aspect complicates things. She moved in with him, accepted his support, and then left when she no longer needed it. That could look like she was using him, which would make her the asshole.\n\nSo, considering the dynamic and the impact on Justin, the answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong). But if the relationship was never real and she's just ending a non-healthy situation, maybe B. However, the way the breakup was handled and the context of financial support suggests A.\n"
