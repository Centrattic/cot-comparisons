We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is 29, and her ex-boyfriend is 20. They had been dating a little over a year. She was in a tough financial situation, taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. Justin, who has Asperger's, started as an awkward client but became more than that. She mentions they got close, had sex, and he started buying her things like groceries and a coat. She moved in with him from her \"crumbling apartment.\" Then she lost her job and had to take a lower-paying one, implying he was a financial support. But she didn't love him as he did. Recently, she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him, which upset him. She tried to console him but he's still hurt. The question is whether she's the asshole here.\n\nThe user thinks she's in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. Let's consider the key points. The relationship might not have been built on equal footing. Justin was providing financial support, and the author was in a vulnerable position. However, she later got a better job, gained financial independence, and decided to end the relationship. The question is whether her decision to break up was the right move.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, relationships should ideally be based on mutual respect and affection. If the author wasn't in love with Justin, but was staying with him for financial reasons, that's a valid concern. The decision to break up when she became financially stable could be seen as her recognizing that the relationship wasn't healthy or fulfilling for her. On the other hand, Justin might have felt deceived if he believed the relationship was more serious, especially since she moved in with him. Ending things might have been abrupt or not handled sensitively.\n\nAnother angle is Justin's age and his condition (Asperger's). If he has difficulty understanding social cues, he might not have fully grasped the nature of the relationship. The author might have led him on, even if unintentionally, by accepting his gifts and moving in together. But if she wasn't emotionally invested, then continuing the relationship could have been unfair to both parties.\n\nThe author tried to console him and suggested a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. That shows she made an effort to ease the transition, though it didn't work out. The fact that she felt guilty afterward suggests some internal conflict, but it's unclear if her actions were wrong.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intent, communication, and the balance of responsibility. If the author was using Justin for financial support and then left when she didn't need him anymore, that's a problem. However, if the relationship was never meant to be a serious one, but Justin misunderstood, then the responsibility is shared. But the author mentions she was going to tell him it was strictly casual but he started to like her more. That implies she may have been aware of the potential for misunderstanding.\n\nAlso, the financial dependency adds complexity. If she was relying on him financially and then left, it's a valid point. But she also mentions that the job she took was lower-paying, so maybe she wasn't in a position to support herself, and Justin was a lifeline. Now, with a better job, she can be independent. In that case, breaking up to pursue her own stability could be seen as responsible.\n\nHowever, the key issue is whether she was emotionally committed. If she wasn't in love, staying in the relationship for financial reasons could be emotionally exploitative. Ending it when she no longer needed the financial support might be necessary for her own well-being. On the other hand, not addressing the imbalance earlier could be seen as a problem.\n\nThe community's typical response in such cases often depends on whether there was mutual understanding of the relationship's nature. If the author wasn't clear about her intentions and Justin assumed it was a serious relationship, she might be at fault. But if she made her intentions clear (as she thought she would tell him it was casual), then Justin's actions (buying her gifts, moving in) might have pushed the relationship beyond what she intended.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are elements where the author could be seen as not fully transparent or fair, especially if Justin had a hard time understanding the relationship's boundaries, her decision to leave once she was financially stable might be justified. The answer isn't black and white, but given the information, the author's actions stem from her own needs and recognizing the relationship's lack of emotional reciprocity. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong.\n"
