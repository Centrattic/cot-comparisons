We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that she broke up with her boyfriend after getting a good job.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The woman is 29, her ex is 20. They dated over a year. She was in a low-income situation, took odd jobs, cleaned apartments. Met him when she was hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Asperger's, was awkward but sweet. They started a relationship, he took care of her financially. She moved in with him, lost her job with the cleaning company, so she became dependent on him. She didn't love him as much as he loved her. Then she got a better job, built savings, and broke up with him. He's upset, she feels bad.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's the asshole here. The possible angles: Was it right to break up after becoming financially stable? Did she use him? Did she have a responsibility to stay? Or was she justified in prioritizing her own needs?\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and honesty are key. She was upfront about not loving him as he did her. She moved in, but that's common in relationships. However, when she had financial stability, she decided to leave. But she did break up with him, which is her right. She tried to console him and offered a friendship, but he was upset. \n\nThe key points: She wasn't in love with him, he had a dependency, and she chose her independence. However, some might argue she led him on or took advantage of his feelings. But others might say she had the right to leave when she found a better path.\n\nAlso, considering the age difference and his Asperger's, he might have been more vulnerable. But she didn't intentionally exploit him. She was in a relationship where she wasn't fully committed. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, people can break up for any reason, especially if the relationship isn't reciprocal. However, the way she left might affect his feelings. But she tried to be kind. So, it's a tricky one. \n\nI think the answer is that she's not in the wrong. People have the right to leave relationships if they're not fulfilling. Even if there's a dependency, that doesn't obligate her to stay. The main issue is that she didn't love him, and she made a choice that prioritized her own well-being. So, answer B.\n"
