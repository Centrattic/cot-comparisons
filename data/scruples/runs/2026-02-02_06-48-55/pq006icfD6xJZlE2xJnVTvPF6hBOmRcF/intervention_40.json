We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is the asshole (AITA) for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 29, her ex is 20 and has Asperger's. They were dating for over a year. She was in a low-income situation, taking odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. She met Justin through that job, they started a relationship, he bought her things, she moved in with him. She didn't love him as much as he did. Then she got a good job, saved money, broke up with him, and now he's devastated. She tried to console him and even suggested friends with benefits, but he was angry. She moved out but feels bad.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider if breaking up because of financial stability is justifiable. She was in a relationship with someone who was providing financial support, but she didn't love him. She broke up when she became more financially stable. Is it wrong to leave a relationship when you're no longer in a vulnerable position, especially if the feelings aren't mutual?\n\nJustin is 20 and has Asperger's, which might affect his understanding of relationships. She took his virginity and he was buying her things, suggesting a more dependent relationship. She moved in with him when her living conditions were poor. Now that she's in a better position, she ends it. But she didn't love him, which is a valid reason to break up. However, he's clearly upset and she's feeling guilty.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, relationships require mutual affection. If she never loved him, staying in the relationship might be more harmful than breaking up when she can support herself. However, the way she ended it\u2014suggesting friends with benefits\u2014could have been hurtful. But overall, the main issue is whether leaving was justified. Since relationships shouldn't be maintained out of financial necessity without love, she's probably not in the wrong. But maybe there's a better way to handle the breakup. However, the question is if she's the asshole, and breaking up when you don't love someone isn't inherently wrong, especially with newfound stability. So the answer might be B.\n"
