We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation involves a 29-year-old woman and a 20-year-old man with Asperger's. They were in a relationship for over a year. She was in a low-income situation, took odd jobs, and then started a better-paying job after moving in with him. She broke up with him after securing the job, and he's upset. She felt she didn't love him as much as he did, and she's now in a better financial position.\n\nFirst, age difference: 9 years. That's a significant gap, but not unheard of. The man has Asperger's, which might affect his understanding of social cues or emotional depth. The woman was initially in an unstable financial situation, moving in with him because her apartment was bad. She lost her job and relied on him for support. Now she's in a better job, saving money, and decided to break up.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and mutual understanding. Did she commit to the relationship knowing she might leave once her situation improved? She mentions she didn't love him like he did. If she knew from the start it was casual, maybe she's responsible for not setting clear boundaries. However, if the relationship became more serious, and she didn't communicate her intentions, that's an issue. The man might have thought he was in a committed relationship, leading to emotional distress when she left.\n\nAlso, financial dependency is a factor. She relied on him for groceries and a coat, which might imply some imbalance. When she became more stable, leaving could be seen as a natural progression, but she had to consider his well-being, especially given his Asperger's which might make it harder for him to cope with sudden changes.\n\nThe question is whether breaking up for personal advancement is wrong. In many cases, prioritizing one's career is understandable, but honesty and communication are crucial. If she didn't set expectations early on, maybe she's at fault. However, if the relationship was always casual or she made her intentions clear, it might be her right to leave. The fact that he was devastated and she tried to console him but he was angry adds complexity. Her feeling bad suggests some guilt, but does that mean she's wrong?\n\nI think it's a judgment call. She had the right to pursue a better job, but if the relationship was more serious and she didn't communicate her feelings properly, she might be at fault. Since she didn't love him and left when her situation improved, it's possible she's in the wrong. But if the relationship was never meant to be serious, maybe not. The answer hinges on whether she was honest about her feelings from the start.\n"
