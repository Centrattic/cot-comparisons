We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after getting a good job. The author was in a relationship with Justin, who had Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. She was in a poor situation, moved in with him after losing her job, and he supported her financially. She didn't love him as much as he loved her. When she got a better job and became more financially stable, she broke up with him, which left him devastated.\n\nFirst, the author's intentions. She didn't love him and the relationship wasn't equal in emotional investment. Justin was giving her financial support and emotional support, but she was using him as a \"meal ticket\" according to her own words. She even considered it strictly casual at first but didn't tell him. Then, when she could support herself, she ended the relationship. \n\nIs it wrong to end a relationship if you don't have feelings for the other person? If the relationship is based on convenience and one person is more invested, then ending it might not be wrong. However, the timing and the way she handled it could be questionable. She broke up with him when she felt financially secure, which might leave him vulnerable since he was living in a luxury condo and perhaps less used to independence.\n\nJustin's perspective: He had Asperger's, which might make it harder for him to handle emotional changes. He was devastated and couldn't accept a friends-with-benefits arrangement. The author tried to console him, but he was still upset. The question is whether the author was selfish in prioritizing her own needs over his emotional well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was in a situation where she was financially dependent on Justin, and then when she became independent, she decided to end the relationship. It's possible she felt trapped in a relationship where she wasn't in love, and the breakup was a way to move on. But if the relationship was unhealthy from the start (implied by her not loving him and using him financially), then ending it might be justified.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. The author didn't communicate her feelings properly, leading Justin to believe there was a future when he might not have been prepared for a breakup. The fact that she moved in with him but didn't love him could indicate she was leading him on, which is unfair. However, the relationship was imbalanced from the start, and the breakup might be a necessary step for her own happiness, even if it was hard for Justin.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong because she ended the relationship when she felt it wasn't right for her. But there's a part where she should have addressed her feelings with Justin earlier instead of letting them move in together without clear intentions. However, since the question is whether she is in the wrong, the answer depends on whether the breakup was justified despite the emotional impact on Justin. Given the imbalance in the relationship and her own needs, the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but there's a gray area. Alternatively, if the focus is on the way she ended it without clear communication, maybe A. But the main issue is her lack of love and dependency, which she had to resolve for herself. So I think B.\n"
