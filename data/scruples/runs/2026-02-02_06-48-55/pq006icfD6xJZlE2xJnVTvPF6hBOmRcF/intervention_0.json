We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a 29-year-old woman, broke up with her 20-year-old boyfriend Justin after getting a good job. They were together for over a year, met when she was cleaning his apartment. Justin has Asperger's, was awkward at first but sweet. She had a casual relationship initially, but he started to like her more, bought her things, she moved in with him. She mentions she didn't love him as much, and after getting a better job, she broke up. Now she's feeling bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user says the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The key points are the age difference, the initial casual nature of the relationship, the financial dependency, and the breakup after her career advancement.\n\nAge difference: 29 vs. 20. That's a 9-year gap. Some might see that as a significant difference, but it's not necessarily a problem unless there's power imbalance. Justin was in a luxury condo, so maybe he had more financial stability. The author was in a lower income situation, moving in with him because her apartment was bad. So financially, Justin was supporting her, which could be a power issue.\n\nInitial intent: She was going to tell him it's strictly casual but he started to like her more. So maybe she didn't set clear boundaries. If she didn't clarify her intentions early, Justin might have invested emotionally without mutual understanding. That could be a point where she's in the wrong if she led him on.\n\nBreakup reason: She got a better job, built savings, and felt comfortable moving out. Her main reason was probably the change in her financial status and perhaps the realization that the relationship wasn't what she wanted long-term. But if the relationship was already based on her financial needs and his emotional investment, breaking up after her situation improved might be seen as using him, which is unethical.\n\nFeeling bad: She still feels some guilt. That suggests she might have considered their connection. Justin being devastated and not wanting a friends-with-benefits arrangement anymore adds to the emotional impact.\n\nBut on the flip side, she had the right to seek a better life and not be in a relationship unless she's in love. Maybe Justin wasn't aware of her feelings or their future. If she didn't communicate her lack of romantic interest, that's her fault. The fact that he was buying her things and she moved in with him while not loving him could indicate she was in it for the financial support, which might be the wrong approach.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was honest about her intentions from the start. If she let the relationship progress without clarifying it's not serious, then she's in the wrong. If she tried to be honest but Justin misread her signals, maybe not. But the user says she was going to tell him it's casual but didn't, so she might have been leading him on. That would make her the asshole. Also, using his financial support as a crutch without being in love could be seen as taking advantage. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
