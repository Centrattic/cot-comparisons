We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about them breaking up with their boyfriend, Justin, after getting a good job. They mention they're 29 and Justin is 20 with Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment, had a casual relationship that became more serious, Justin provided financial support, and she ended up moving in with him. Now she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him, leading to his devastation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether she's at fault. She was in a relationship but didn't feel love in the same way as Justin. He bought her things and supported her financially, but she wasn't in love. She decided to break up when she got a better job, which gave her more financial stability. The key points here are her feelings, the power dynamic in the relationship, and the reason for the breakup.\n\nShe says she doesn't love Justin like he does her. In a relationship, mutual feelings are important. If she's not in love, then the relationship is one-sided. Justin was giving her financial support and things, but she might have been taking advantage of that. However, when she got a good job and felt more secure, she ended things. The question is whether that's justified.\n\nBreaking up because you can now be financially independent isn't necessarily wrong. It could be that she realized the relationship wasn't built on mutual love but rather on her dependence. However, she had been relying on him financially, which might have created an imbalance. She also mentions moving in with him, so the relationship was serious. Ending it when she no longer needs financial help might be seen as leaving once the convenience is over, which could be perceived as selfish.\n\nOn the other hand, if she never loved him and he was in love with her, then the relationship was inherently unequal. She should have addressed her feelings earlier instead of leading him on. But since she tried to transition to friends with benefits and he was upset, maybe she didn't handle the breakup well. However, the main issue is whether she's in the wrong for ending a relationship where her feelings weren't mutual, especially after financial support.\n\nI think the core here is about honesty and emotional reciprocity. She should have communicated her feelings sooner if she wasn't interested in a serious relationship. But since she was in a committed relationship with someone who was emotionally invested, and she decided to leave when her financial situation improved, it's a bit tricky. Some might see it as her using Justin until she could be self-sufficient, which would make her the asshole. Others might argue that it's better to end the relationship once you realize it's not working, even if it's inconvenient.\n\nJustin's age and Asperger's could also play a role. He might have been less experienced and more emotionally dependent. The fact that she was in a better financial position after the job but had been relying on him before complicates things. If she ended it because she no longer needed his support, that could be seen as abandoning him when he's vulnerable. But if the relationship was never based on love from her side, then maybe it's not fair for him to expect it to last.\n\nIn the AITA context, people often consider whether the breaker of the relationship acted with integrity. She did break up when she realized the relationship wasn't meeting her emotional needs, but the timing being after financial gain could be seen as a problem. The community might be divided, but the main factor is her lack of love and not leading him on. So I'm leaning towards B, but not entirely sure. Maybe she's not the asshole because staying in a relationship without love isn't healthy, but the way she handled it might be questionable. The answer likely is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
