We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for breaking up with their boyfriend after getting a good job. The situation is a bit complex. The user is 29, dating Justin who's 20 and has Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. He started buying her things, and she moved in with him. She was relying on him financially after losing her job. Now she got a better job, saved money, and broke up with him.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the power dynamic. She mentions that Justin was kind of her \"meal ticket\" when she was in a bad financial situation. That could be a red flag because it might imply an imbalance in the relationship where she was dependent on him financially while he was providing for her. Now that she's financially stable, she's ended the relationship. \n\nThe question is whether that makes her the asshole. On one hand, people can change their circumstances, and it's not wrong to seek a better life. But if the breakup was primarily due to her becoming more financially stable and not wanting to be in a relationship where she was dependent, maybe she's using her new status as an excuse. Also, Justin was clearly hurt, and she tried to offer friendship or a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which made him angry. \n\nBut the user says she doesn't love him like he does her. So maybe there's a lack of emotional commitment from the start. However, if she stayed in the relationship just to take advantage of his financial support and left when she could support herself, that's manipulative. On the other hand, if she genuinely felt the relationship wasn't love-based and decided to leave when she was able, that's different. \n\nThe key points are: financial dependency vs. genuine connection, the age difference (9 years is a lot, but some might say it's okay), and whether the breakup was justified. The user might be in the right if the relationship wasn't healthy or based on love. However, the fact that she used his support during her tough time and then left when things improved could be seen as taking advantage. \n\nAsperger's could affect how Justin handles emotions and breakups, but that doesn't mean the user is in the wrong if the relationship wasn't reciprocal. The user might be the asshole if she only stayed for his money and left when she didn't need him anymore. But if she was honest with herself and made a decision based on her own needs after being in a situation where she wasn't in love, it's a different story. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because she's making a decision based on her own circumstances and feelings. However, there's a gray area where her financial dependency might have been a factor. But since she states she didn't love him, it's more about personal choice rather than exploitation. So the answer is B.\n"
