We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. So the user is asking whether the person who broke up with her boyfriend after getting a better job is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe woman, who's 29, was in a relationship with Justin, who is 20 and has Asperger's. They met when she started cleaning his apartment. She mentions that Justin was a good provider, buying her clothes and groceries, and they moved in together. She didn't love him the way he loved her, and when she got a better job, she broke up with him. Now she's feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age difference. Justin is 20, which is still quite young. He took her in when she was in a bad situation financially, provided her with things she needed. She admits she didn't love him but stayed with him for his support. When she got a better job and her financial situation improved, she ended the relationship. That seems like she was using him for his resources. \n\nEmotionally, Justin is clearly attached and vulnerable. With Asperger's, he might have difficulty reading social cues or handling rejection, which could explain his devastation. The woman broke up with him, then offered a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected. She moved out, but she's feeling some guilt now.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, using someone for their financial support and then leaving when you no longer need it can be seen as selfish. Even if the relationship wasn't based on love, there's a responsibility when someone is emotionally invested and vulnerable. However, she also had the right to pursue better opportunities. The key issue here is the lack of mutual emotional connection and the potential exploitation of Justin's kindness.\n\nOn the other hand, she might argue that she had the right to leave when she felt it was necessary for her well-being or when she no longer wanted to be in the relationship. But the fact that she didn't love him and used his resources raises questions about the ethics of the situation. \n\nConsidering all factors, she made a self-serving decision that left Justin in a worse position emotionally. While she had the right to leave, the way she handled it and the reasons behind it might make her the asshole. So the answer is likely A.\n"
