We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a boyfriend after getting a good job. The author is 29, her ex-boyfriend Justin is 20 and has Asperger's. They met when she was cleaning his apartment. She ended the relationship after securing a better job.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The woman was in a situation where she was financially struggling and took odd jobs, including cleaning. She met Justin through that job, and he started supporting her financially by buying groceries, clothes, etc. They moved in together. She didn't love him but was in a relationship. After getting a better job, she broke up with him. Now she's feeling guilty.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants my opinion. Let's break it down. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and emotional connection are important. The woman might have realized that she wasn't in love with Justin and that their relationship wasn't based on mutual affection but dependency. She was using his financial support when she was struggling, and once she became financially stable, she ended the relationship. That could be seen as self-serving, but also as recognizing that the relationship wasn't healthy or fulfilling for her emotionally.\n\nHowever, Justin is 20 and may have been more emotionally invested. The fact that he has Asperger's might affect how he processes emotions, making the breakup harder for him. Also, she moved in with him and he supported her, so there's potential for dependency. The breakup might have been abrupt, and she tried to offer a friends-with-benefits arrangement, which he rejected, leading to his devastation.\n\nBut from her perspective, she felt the relationship wasn't love-based. She was okay with casual at first but he wanted more, and she ended it once she felt she can make her own way. It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, she's ending a relationship where she wasn't emotionally invested. On the other, she might have used him financially and then left when she didn't need him anymore.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some might see it as her being selfish, while others might see her as prioritizing her own needs. The key is whether she was honest about her intentions. Since she initially didn't plan to be in a serious relationship but he wanted more, maybe she should have been clearer. However, she did attempt to explain things and tried to console him.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer depends on whether the relationship was based on deceit or mutual understanding. If she was upfront about her lack of love, then she's not wrong. If she led him on, then she's in the wrong. The story says she didn't love him but continued, which might imply she wasn't honest. However, relationships can be complex, especially when there's a significant age and life stage difference. \n\nI think the answer is B (not wrong) because she's choosing herself and her future, but there's a nuance. However, since she didn't love him and used his financial support, it's a bit of a toss-up. But generally, people can end relationships if they're not happy, even if the other person is upset. So, B.\n"
