We had been dating for a little over a year. I\u2019m to lack of a better word piss poor and to make a living I had been taking odd jobs here and there. One of those jobs was cleaning apartments. The area I live in is becoming gentrified so you have low income apartment dwellers like me next to to upper class people like Justin living in luxury condos just couple miles away. \n\nI met Justin as I got hired to clean his apartment. Justin has Aspergers and was a awkward at first, but he\u2019s a sweetheart you know. We got to know each other pretty well, he was funny and attractive and before you know it I took his virginity and we started having sex. I was going to tell him its strictly casual, but he started to like me a lot and he would buy me groceries, new clothes like a really nice winter coat, and I had even moved in with him out of my crumbling apartment building. I had lost my job with the apartment cleaning company as well and had to get a lower paying one so Justin was kind of my meal ticket.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong Justin\u2019s nice, he\u2019s attractive, and he\u2019s good in bed, but I just don\u2019t love him like he does. Recently though I got offered and took a really good job at another cleaning company that paid really well. I\u2019ve built up a hefty amount savings because I didn\u2019t have many expenses with Justin. I broke up with him a week ago and he\u2019s devastated, I tried to console him and tell him he\u2019d find another girl, but he wouldn\u2019t hear it. I told him we could still be like friends with benefits, but that just made him angry. I moved out and into a new apartment, but I still kind of feel bad about Justin. \n\nAm I the asshole? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation. The person in question is a 29-year-old woman who broke up with her boyfriend, Justin, a 20-year-old with Asperger's. They were in a relationship for over a year. She had been in a financially unstable situation, working odd jobs, including cleaning his apartment. Justin started buying her things, and she moved in with him. She felt it was a financial lifeline. Now she got a good job, saved money, and broke up with him. They tried friends with benefits but that didn't work. She feels bad but is wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics of their relationship. Justin is significantly younger, with Asperger's, which might affect his understanding of relationships. The woman mentions that Justin was buying her groceries, clothes, a coat, and she moved in with him. She also mentions that she was moving out of a crumbling apartment into his luxury condo. It seems like Justin was providing financial support, and she was relying on that. \n\nThe key point here is whether the relationship was based on genuine mutual affection or if there was an imbalance due to financial dependencies. The woman states she doesn't love him as he does. Breaking up because she's now financially stable could be seen as her moving on once she's no longer in need of his support. However, Justin's age and his condition might mean he's less experienced in handling relationship endings, which could explain his devastation. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she's honest about her feelings. She didn't force the relationship; she broke up when her circumstances changed. But relying on someone for financial support and then leaving once that's no longer necessary might come off as using the relationship for that purpose. However, if the relationship was genuine at the time and she's now choosing to end it due to her own better circumstances, that's a common reason for breakups. \n\nThe age difference is notable. A 9-year gap isn't unheard of, but Justin being 20 and her being 29, she's in a more mature position. She might have had more awareness of the relationship's dynamics. If she was aware of his feelings and her own lack of reciprocation, then ending the relationship isn't wrong. However, the fact that she moved in with him and relied on his resources while not feeling the same could imply some manipulation or taking advantage, especially if she knew he was emotionally invested.\n\nOn the other hand, she's also in a situation where she was in a better position financially after getting a new job, so moving out and focusing on her own life is understandable. People often end relationships when they feel they're no longer compatible or when the relationship isn't meeting their needs. However, the context of financial dependency complicates things. If she was using him for financial support and then left once she didn't need it, that could be seen as selfish. But if the breakup was due to her own growth and realization of not being in love, maybe not.\n\nThe friends with benefits suggestion leading to anger might show that Justin was emotionally invested beyond just casual. The woman tried to console him, but he's devastated. The question is whether she had a responsibility to stay in the relationship once she had his emotional and financial support, even if she didn't love him. But people are allowed to end relationships when they're not happy. \n\nIn conclusion, while there are elements that could be debated, the woman made the choice to end the relationship when her circumstances changed. She didn't force the relationship; she ended it when she felt it wasn't right for her. However, the financial dependency might make the situation more complex. The answer isn't clear-cut, but leaning towards her not being in the wrong because she's acting based on her own needs and growth, even if it was difficult for Justin.\n"
