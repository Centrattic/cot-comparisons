I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor borrowing their dog to help distract her autistic son, and the author is upset about it. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author's dog is part of their family. They take care of the dog with a lot of exercise and attention. The neighbor, who has an autistic son, started having the dog taken out by her son without asking each time. The author feels this is happening too often and is causing the dog to develop bad habits. They also miss out on their own time with the dog, which helps with their anxiety and depression.\n\nThe neighbor isn't asking anymore; the dog is just taken without permission. The author's friend says they're being selfish, but the author is conflicted because they don't want to be a jerk, especially since the child seems to benefit from the dog's presence.\n\nNow, considering the rights and responsibilities here. The dog is the author's property and a family member. The neighbor is using the dog as a resource without proper consent each time. While the neighbor's situation is challenging, the author's mental health and the dog's well-being are also important. The dog's behavior has deteriorated, which might be due to the neighbor not enforcing training or the dog being overstimulated. \n\nThe neighbor should communicate better and ask for permission each time. However, the author has a right to set boundaries for their dog. The initial agreement was for occasional borrowing, but it's become regular without consent. The author has a valid reason to address this, as their mental health and the dog's training are affected.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I don't think so. They have the right to protect their family member. The neighbor's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, are overstepping. The author's friend's criticism might be a bit harsh; it's not about being selfish but about setting necessary boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B: No.\n"
