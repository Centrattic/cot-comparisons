I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a neighbor borrowing their dog, but the dog is being used as a distraction for the neighbor's autistic son, Alex. The author is upset because the dog isn't coming back after being borrowed, leading to a loss of personal bonding time and the dog developing bad habits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clear that they don't mind occasional borrowing, but now it's daily and affecting their mental health. They have anxiety and depression, and the dog is a source of comfort. That's a valid point. The neighbor is using the dog to help her son, which is understandable, especially since raising a child with autism can be challenging. However, the neighbor isn't asking permission anymore, which is a key issue. The author's friend said they were being selfish, but that might be dismissing their legitimate concerns.\n\nThe dog's behavior has changed, which the author attributes to the neighbor's son and their handling. The neighbor's reaction, laughing and saying the dog climbs onto Alex's lap, suggests she's aware of the behavior but not concerned. The author is justified in wanting their dog to behave as he did before. The fact that the neighbor used to ask but now doesn't shows a breakdown in communication and respect for the author's boundaries.\n\nAlso, the author's mental health is a factor. If the dog's absence is contributing to their anxiety, that's a significant issue. The neighbor's actions, while well-intentioned, are impacting the author's well-being. The author has the right to set boundaries for their pet, especially since it's a family member. The friend's comment about not understanding the challenges of raising a child with a disability might be true, but that doesn't negate the author's valid feelings and needs.\n\nSo, the main points are: the neighbor is using the dog without permission now, the author's mental health is affected, and the dog's behavior is changing. The neighbor's actions cross into overstepping, even if done with good intentions. The author isn't being selfish; they're asserting their right to have their pet treated properly and to maintain a relationship with their dog. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to ask for their dog to be respected and not taken without consent.\n"
