I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're wrong for wanting their neighbor to stop \"borrowing\" their dog. The neighbor has an autistic son, Alex, who uses the dog for distraction. The author's dog is a family member, providing emotional support, and now the neighbor is taking the dog daily without asking, leading to the dog developing bad habits and the author missing out on bonding time.\n\nFirst, the author has a valid point about their dog being a family member, not just a toy. The dog's behavior has changed, which affects the author's routine and mental health. They mentioned anxiety and depression, so their emotional well-being is tied to the dog's presence. The neighbor's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, are causing stress and practical issues for the author.\n\nThe neighbor isn't asking anymore, which is a problem. The author's friend called them selfish, but that's not fair. The author isn't refusing help entirely but is upset about the lack of communication and the dog's behavior issues. The key here is consent and respect. The neighbor should ask each time instead of assuming. Also, the dog's training is suffering, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor's situation is challenging with a child with special needs. However, the author isn't denying the neighbor help entirely. They're asking for respect for their dog's training and their own mental health. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially when their needs are being affected. The neighbor needs to communicate better and respect the author's boundaries. So the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their own well-being and their pet's training, which is reasonable.\n"
