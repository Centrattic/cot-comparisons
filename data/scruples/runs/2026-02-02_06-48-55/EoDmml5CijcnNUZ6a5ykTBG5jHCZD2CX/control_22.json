I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong. So the situation is about a neighbor borrowing their dog to help distract her autistic son. The author is upset because the dog is being taken without permission daily, leading to personal time loss and the dog developing bad habits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The neighbor's son has autism, which the author acknowledges. The neighbor might be under stress managing her son's needs. However, the author is the dog's owner and has specific routines and emotional needs tied to their pet. The dog is part of their family, providing emotional support for their anxiety and depression. \n\nThe neighbor is \"borrowing\" the dog daily without asking, which is a key point. The author mentioned that initially, they were okay with a one-time request, but now it's become a regular, unsolicited occurrence. This could be seen as a boundary issue. The author's mental health is a significant factor here, as losing time with the dog affects their well-being. \n\nThe dog's behavior has also changed, which the author attributes to the neighbor's handling. The neighbor's response seems dismissive, laughing it off and not addressing the new behaviors. The friend's comment that the author is selfish might be invalidating their legitimate concerns, especially since the author's mental health is involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor might have good intentions, trying to manage her son's needs. However, the author has a right to their dog's companionship and to maintain their routines. The neighbor should communicate and ask for permission each time rather than taking the dog without consent. The fact that the dog is being used without the owner's input daily suggests that the neighbor is overstepping boundaries. \n\nThe author's anxiety and depression are exacerbated by the loss of their dog's presence, which is a valid reason to seek a change. The neighbor's actions are impacting the author's mental health, which is a serious consideration. The dog's behavior issues could also affect the author's ability to care for the pet properly, leading to potential long-term problems.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is not in the wrong because they have the right to their pet's companionship and to set boundaries. The neighbor is overstepping by taking the dog without permission regularly, which disregards the author's needs and the dog's well-being. The friend's judgment that the author is selfish is misplaced here. The author's concerns are valid and justified, especially considering their mental health and the dog's behavior issues. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
