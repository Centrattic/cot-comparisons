I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor borrowing the author's dog to distract her autistic son. The author is upset because their dog is now being taken without asking daily, leading to some behavioral issues and loss of bonding time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to their dog's companionship and the dog's well-being. The neighbor's intention is to help her autistic son, which is a valid concern. However, the neighbor is taking the dog without asking each time, which is a boundary issue. The author mentioned that the neighbor used to ask once, but now it's daily and without permission. That's a problem because the dog belongs to the author, and they should have control over his schedule.\n\nThe author's mental health is also a factor. The dog is a source of comfort for someone with anxiety and depression, so having that time taken away can be detrimental. The neighbor's actions, while well-meaning, are affecting the author's well-being. The dog's behavior changes could also be due to inconsistent training from the neighbor's side, possibly because the neighbor isn't as consistent in enforcing the rules as the owner is.\n\nThe friend's comment that the author is being selfish might not be fair. It's about respecting each other's boundaries, not about whether someone has a disability. The neighbor could find other ways to help her son without using the dog as a resource. The author is justified in wanting to set boundaries here. So, it's not the author's fault. The neighbor is overstepping by not asking each time and not respecting the dog's owner's needs.\n"
