I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's neighbor has been \"borrowing\" the author's dog to help distract her autistic son, Alex. The author is upset about this for a couple of reasons. First, they miss the dog and it affects their mental health. Second, the dog has started developing bad habits, which they think the neighbor or Alex might be causing.\n\nThe author mentions that they don't mind occasional borrowing, but now it's daily. They also feel that the neighbor isn't asking first, which makes them panic when they come home and the dog is gone. Their friend even called them selfish for not understanding the challenges of raising a child with a disability. The author is conflicted because they don't want to be mean, but they do want their dog back and to maintain discipline.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the neighbor's intention is to help her son, which is understandable. Autism can present challenges, and having a dog as a calming influence might be beneficial for Alex. However, the author's dog is their property and a family member. The neighbor not asking first and taking the dog daily without permission could be seen as overstepping. The author has the right to their dog's company and to set boundaries, especially when their mental health is affected. The friend's comment about selfishness might be dismissive of the author's legitimate concerns. The neighbor should communicate better and perhaps find alternative solutions for Alex without taking the dog so frequently. The author is justified in wanting to address this without being rude, but they're not wrong for feeling this way. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
