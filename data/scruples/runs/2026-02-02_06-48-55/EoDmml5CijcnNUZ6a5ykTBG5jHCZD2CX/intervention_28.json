I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a neighbor borrowing their dog regularly without asking, leading to the author's dog developing bad habits and the author missing out on bonding time. The author is considering confronting the neighbor but is conflicted because a friend said they were being selfish and the neighbor's son has autism.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The dog is a family member, and the owner relies on their time with the dog for mental health. The neighbor started borrowing the dog frequently, not just occasionally, and the dog's behavior has changed. The neighbor's son has autism, which complicates social interactions, and the neighbor might be using the dog to manage her son's behavior. \n\nLegally, the dog is the author's property, so the neighbor shouldn't take it without permission. The author is within their rights to ask for the dog back. However, the neighbor might not be intentionally misbehaving; perhaps she's not aware of the impact on the author. The friend's comment about selfishness is a red herring because the author has a legitimate reason to want their dog's company. The dog's new behaviors could be due to the neighbor's handling, which the author is justified in addressing.\n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable. They are balancing their needs with the neighbor's situation. The main issue is the neighbor's lack of communication and the frequency of borrowing. Since the dog is a family pet, the author should assert their right to have the dog back, but in a considerate way. So, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). They have valid concerns about their mental health and the dog's well-being.\n"
