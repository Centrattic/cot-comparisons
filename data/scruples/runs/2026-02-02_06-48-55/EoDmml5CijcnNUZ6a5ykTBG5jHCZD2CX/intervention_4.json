I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the neighbor's son, who is autistic, frequently taking the dog without permission, leading to the dog developing bad habits and the author missing out on bonding time. The author's friend criticized them as selfish, which made the author doubt themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The neighbor's son has autism, which affects social boundaries. The neighbor is using the dog to manage her son's behavior, which is understandable. However, the dog is a family member for the author, providing emotional support. The neighbor isn't asking each time, leading to unannounced absences of the dog. The dog's behavior has changed, possibly due to the new interactions. The author feels their mental health is affected.\n\nThe main conflict is between the neighbor's need to manage her son's care and the author's right to have their pet treated with respect and their mental health needs. The neighbor's actions, while well-intentioned, are overstepping by not asking each time. The dog's altered behavior is a consequence that needs addressing, possibly due to different handling by the neighbor or the son.\n\nThe author's friend labeled them as selfish, but the author's concerns are valid. The dog should be respected as a pet, not a toy. The neighbor should communicate and set boundaries. The author is not being selfish but is asserting their right to manage their pet's care and their own emotional well-being. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
