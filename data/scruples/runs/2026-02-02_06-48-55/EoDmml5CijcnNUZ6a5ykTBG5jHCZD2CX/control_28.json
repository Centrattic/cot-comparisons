I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a neighbor using their dog to help distract her autistic son. The author is upset because their dog is being taken without asking, and the dog is developing bad habits. They also mention missing out on their own time with the dog, which helps with their anxiety and depression.\n\nFirst, the neighbor is using the dog as a distraction for her son. The author initially was okay with it once, but now it's become a daily thing without asking. The neighbor isn't even consulting the author anymore, which is a problem. The dog is a family member, not just a tool for the neighbor's child. The author has a legitimate reason to be upset because their mental health relies on the dog's companionship.\n\nThe neighbor's response was dismissive, saying that the dog is fine with it. But the dog's behavior has changed\u2014bad habits like begging and climbing on furniture. That suggests the dog's environment is affecting its behavior, which the author is responsible for. The neighbor isn't respecting the author's boundaries now that it's become routine. The author mentioned this once, but the neighbor didn't take it seriously, laughing it off.\n\nThe friend's comment that the author is being selfish doesn't consider the author's mental health needs. It's important to balance the neighbor's needs with the author's rights as the dog's owner. The key issue is that the neighbor isn't respecting the author's autonomy over their pet, especially without permission, leading to negative consequences for both the author and the dog.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries regarding their dog, especially when it's affecting their well-being and the dog's behavior. The neighbor's actions are overstepping, and the author is justified in wanting to address this.\n"
