I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a neighbor whose autistic son has been \"borrowing\" the author's dog without asking, leading to issues with the dog's behavior and the author's mental health.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They mention that the dog is a family member and that their dog's routine with them is important for their mental health, given they have anxiety and depression. The neighbor started letting the son take the dog daily without permission, which is a problem because the dog isn't being returned until dinner. Also, the dog's behavior has changed, which the author attributes to the neighbor's son and possibly the neighbor's handling. The author feels they're not being selfish, but their friend says they are.\n\nOn the neighbor's side, they have a child with special needs, which complicates things. The neighbor might think that the dog helps her son when she needs to work. However, the neighbor's son is taking the dog without permission, which is a key issue. The author mentioned they were fine with it initially but now it's become a daily occurrence without communication.\n\nThe main points here are consent and communication. The neighbor is allowing her son to \"borrow\" the dog without asking each time, which breaches the author's boundaries. The author's mental health and the dog's well-being are also factors. The dog's new behaviors suggest that the neighbor's son might not be reinforcing the same training, which affects the dog's habits.\n\nThe friend's argument that the author is selfish might not hold because the author has valid reasons related to their mental health and the dog's training. The neighbor, while trying to manage her son's needs, should have maintained communication and respect the author's boundaries. The key issue is the lack of consent after the initial okay. The neighbor's actions have escalated beyond what the author agreed to, leading to negative consequences for both the author and the dog.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is not in the wrong. The neighbor is overstepping by not asking each time and affecting the author's well-being. The answer should be B.\n"
