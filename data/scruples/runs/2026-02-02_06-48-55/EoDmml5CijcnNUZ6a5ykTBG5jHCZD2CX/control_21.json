I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a dog that's part of their family, and a neighbor who has an autistic son, Alex. The neighbor sometimes sends Alex to walk the author's dog to help manage him, which started as a one-time thing but has turned into daily \"borrowing.\" The author is upset because they miss their dog, who's a source of comfort for their anxiety and depression, and the dog is developing bad habits. The friend even called the author selfish, which is making them feel bad.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The neighbor's actions were initially okay, but now it's become routine without asking. The author mentions that the neighbor started \"borrowing\" the dog every day without permission, which is a key point. The author has a legitimate need for the dog's companionship for their mental health, and the dog's behavior has changed negatively, which could be due to the neighbor's handling or the dog's exposure to a different environment. \n\nThe neighbor's initial request was to help with her son, but now it's daily and without asking. That crosses a boundary. The author isn't being selfish if their well-being is affected. They have the right to control their pet's care and their personal time with the dog. The fact that the dog is developing bad habits adds another layer\u2014maybe the neighbor isn't training him properly or the dog is confused by different rules from different people. \n\nThe friend's comment that the author is selfish might not be fair because the author's mental health is impacted. The neighbor might not realize the extent of the issue. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're trying to balance their needs with the neighbor's situation. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons to ask for their dog back. The neighbor's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, are overstepping. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
