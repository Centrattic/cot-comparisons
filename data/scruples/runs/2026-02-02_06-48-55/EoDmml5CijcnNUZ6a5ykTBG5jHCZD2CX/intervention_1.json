I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Asking) is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor borrowing their dog to distract her autistic son.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is upset because their dog is being taken without asking, leading to missed time with the dog and bad habits developing. The neighbor is using the dog to help manage her son's behavior, which she needs for her own work. The dog is family, and the owner has anxiety and depression, relying on the dog for comfort. On the other hand, the neighbor's son has autism and may need the distraction, and the neighbor might feel she's helping both the child and the owner by offering to take the dog.\n\nThe author's main complaints are about the dog's behavior changing and missing out on their own bonding time. The neighbor is borrowing the dog daily without permission, which the author is not comfortable with. The friend's comment that the author is being selfish adds another layer, suggesting that the neighbor's needs are more important. However, the author isn't completely against occasional borrowing, just the current frequency and lack of consent.\n\nI should consider if the neighbor's actions are respectful. Borrowing without asking is a key issue. Even if it's for a good reason, respecting the owner's autonomy is important. The dog is a family member, and the owner's mental health is tied to their relationship with the dog. The neighbor's son might need the dog, but that doesn't override the owner's rights. The friend's argument about not understanding disability is a bit dismissive, but the owner's mental health is also a valid concern.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They want to set boundaries, which is reasonable. The neighbor isn't respecting those boundaries by taking the dog daily without asking. The author's feelings and health are valid. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to address this. The neighbor should be asked to stop the unauthorized borrowing. So the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
