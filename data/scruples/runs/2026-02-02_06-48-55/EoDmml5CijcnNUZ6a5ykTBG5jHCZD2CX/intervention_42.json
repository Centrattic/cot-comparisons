I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The original poster (OP) wrote about their neighbor using their dog to distract her autistic son, Alex. The neighbor's son takes the dog every day without asking, and the neighbor does it more regularly, leading to the OP feeling upset about losing bonding time and the dog developing bad habits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The OP's dog is a family member, and they rely on the dog for emotional support due to their anxiety and depression. The neighbor is trying to help her son, who has autism, by using the dog to keep him calm. The neighbor didn't ask for permission beyond the initial time, and the dog is now showing behavior issues.\n\nThe friend says the OP is selfish, which suggests there's a conflict between personal needs and another person's child's needs. But the OP is also a person with mental health issues, which is a valid concern. The neighbor's actions might be well-intentioned, but they're not respecting the OP's boundaries once they start becoming a problem.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The initial permission was given for one instance, but the neighbor continued using the dog daily without asking. That's a boundary violation. The OP has the right to ask them to stop if they're uncomfortable. The dog's behavior changing is another issue\u2014maybe Alex isn't trained properly with the dog, leading to bad habits. But the main issue is the neighbor not respecting the OP's wishes once the situation became a problem.\n\nSo, the neighbor is in the wrong for not seeking permission each time and overstepping. The OP is not being selfish; they're asserting their needs, which are valid. The friend's judgment is incorrect here. The OP has a right to their dog's companionship and should be able to set boundaries. The answer should be B, the OP is not in the wrong.\n"
