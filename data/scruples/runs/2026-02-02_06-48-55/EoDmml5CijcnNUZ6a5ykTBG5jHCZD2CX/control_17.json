I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a neighbor borrowing their dog regularly to help distract her autistic son. The author is upset because the dog is now being taken without asking, leading to the dog's behavior problems and the author's emotional stress.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The dog is a family member, not just a pet. The neighbor started using the dog to manage her son's behavior. Initially, it was a one-time thing with permission, but now it's daily and without asking. The author is feeling deprived of their bonding time with the dog, which is important for their mental health. The dog is developing bad habits, which might be due to inconsistent training from the neighbor's side. The friend told the author they were selfish, but the author is conflicted because they don't want to seem unkind to the neighbor and her son.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the neighbor is using the dog as a distraction tool, which is a bit of a stretch. The dog isn't a toy but a living being with a routine. The initial permission was given, but regular, unsolicited borrowing without communication is crossing a boundary. The author's mental health is affected, which is valid. The neighbor's laughter at the dog's bad behavior suggests she's not taking responsibility for reinforcing those behaviors. The author's concern isn't just about missing out on time with the dog but also about the dog's well-being and training. The friend's comment that the author is selfish doesn't consider the emotional impact on the author. \n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor's son has needs, and the dog provides a positive distraction. However, the neighbor should have considered the long-term effects on the dog and the author's relationship with the dog. The author isn't being selfish; they're addressing the misuse of their pet and the resulting issues. The neighbor's actions are causing harm, both to the dog's behavior and the author's well-being. The author is within their rights to set boundaries here. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
