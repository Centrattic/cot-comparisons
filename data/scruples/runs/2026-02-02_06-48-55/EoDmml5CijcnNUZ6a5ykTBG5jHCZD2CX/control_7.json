I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding their neighbor borrowing their dog.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author's dog is being taken by the neighbor's autistic son regularly without being asked each time. The neighbor does this to help her son, who can get stressed or bored. The author is upset because they miss time with their dog and the dog is developing bad habits. Their friend called them selfish, but they feel bad because the neighbor's son benefits.\n\nSo, the key points here. The dog is a family member for the author, providing emotional support, which is important given their anxiety and depression. The neighbor is using the dog to manage her son's needs, but without consistent communication. The author's main issues are loss of bonding time and the dog's behavior changes. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the neighbor is taking the dog without asking each time, which is a breach of the author's autonomy. The author has the right to decide who spends time with their pet. The fact that the neighbor started this as a one-time favor but now it's daily without permission suggests it's overstepping. The author isn't refusing all the time; they just want boundaries. \n\nThe argument that the neighbor is helping her son is valid, but that doesn't negate the author's needs. The author is not being selfish for wanting their own time and to maintain their dog's training. The friend's comment that the author is selfish seems incorrect because the author isn't denying the neighbor's needs entirely but is asking for balance. \n\nAlso, the dog's bad habits are a legitimate concern. The neighbor's son might be encouraging behaviors that the author has worked to prevent. The author's mention of this to the neighbor was met with a dismissive response, which could indicate the neighbor isn't considering the long-term impact on the dog.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to set boundaries with their pet, especially when it affects their mental health and the dog's training. The neighbor should be asked to communicate and respect those boundaries. So the answer is B.\n"
