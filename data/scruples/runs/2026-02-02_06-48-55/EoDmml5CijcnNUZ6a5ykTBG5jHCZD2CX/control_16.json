I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a neighbor borrowing their dog to help distract her autistic son. The author is upset because the dog is being taken without asking every day, leading to the dog developing bad habits and the author missing out on their bonding time.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the neighbor started this without permission. The initial text asking if it's okay was once, but now the neighbor's son is taking the dog daily without asking. That's a problem because the dog is a pet, not a toy to be borrowed whenever. The neighbor might be well-meaning, but taking the dog without permission every day crosses a line.\n\nThe author's main points are about their emotional well-being and the dog's behavior changes. They rely on the dog for comfort given their anxiety and depression. The neighbor's actions are interfering with that. Plus, the dog's new behaviors like begging and climbing on furniture suggest that the way he's being handled by the neighbor or her son isn't consistent with the training the author has done. The neighbor's dismissive attitude (\"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap\") doesn't help either, as it shows a lack of concern for the dog's training and the author's rules.\n\nThe friend's comment that the author is being selfish is questionable. While raising an autistic child is challenging, that doesn't mean the author's needs are invalid. The neighbor should respect the author's boundaries and ask each time, especially since the dog is a family member. The fact that the neighbor isn't asking anymore suggests she's overstepping. The author has a right to set limits to protect their pet and their own mental health.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The neighbor is the one who's not respecting the dog's ownership and the author's needs. The author is justified in wanting to set boundaries to maintain their relationship with their pet and ensure the dog's training isn't compromised.\n"
