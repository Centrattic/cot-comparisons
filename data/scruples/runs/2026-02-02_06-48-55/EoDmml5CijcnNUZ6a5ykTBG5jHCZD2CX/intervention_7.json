I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their neighbor to stop \"borrowing\" their dog. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the neighbor's son has autism and can get stressed or bored. The neighbor uses the dog to help calm him down when she's working. The author doesn't mind occasional help but is upset because the dog is now taken every day without asking, and the dog is developing bad habits. Also, the author has anxiety and depression, and missing out on their bonding time with the dog is affecting their mental health.\n\nThe author's friend said they were being selfish, but the user thinks the author might be in the wrong. Wait, the user actually says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious. Hmm. That's interesting because usually, people might side with the author here.\n\nBut let's break it down. The neighbor isn't asking anymore; the son just takes the dog. That's a problem. The author's dog is a family member, and they rely on their time with the dog for emotional support. The dog's behavior has changed, which the author is concerned about. The neighbor's response was dismissive when the author mentioned the issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor is helping manage a child with special needs. But the line is crossed when the dog isn't being \"borrowed\" with permission anymore. The author has a right to their pet's care and their own emotional well-being. The friend's comment about being selfish might not consider the author's mental health struggles. \n\nSo, the key points are the unauthorized takes, the impact on the author's mental health, and the dog's training issues. The neighbor might not be at fault for the child's behavior, but the lack of communication and permission is a problem. The author is justified in wanting to set boundaries, especially if the situation is affecting their well-being and the dog's behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
