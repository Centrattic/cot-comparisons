I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting their neighbor to stop \"borrowing\" their dog to distract her autistic son. \n\nFirst, the author's dog is a family member, and they rely on the dog for emotional support given their anxiety and depression. The neighbor's son, Alex, is taking the dog out without asking, leading to the dog being gone all day. The author notices behavioral issues in the dog since this started, like the dog becoming more demanding and less well-behaved. The neighbor seems to be using the dog as a distraction for Alex, which the author is okay with occasionally but not daily.\n\nThe author's friend accused them of being selfish, but the author feels conflicted because they don't want to be seen as mean. The key points here are the dog's well-being and the author's mental health. The neighbor isn't asking for permission anymore, which is a problem. The dog's behavior has changed, which could indicate that the new routine is affecting him negatively. \n\nFrom a rights perspective, the dog is the author's property and companion. The neighbor's use of the dog without consent crosses a boundary, especially since it's daily and without communication. The author's mental health is also a valid concern, as their routine and emotional support are being disrupted. The neighbor's actions, even if well-intentioned, shouldn't override the owner's rights and the dog's training. \n\nThe neighbor might be under stress with raising an autistic child, but that doesn't justify disregarding the author's boundaries. The author isn't just being selfish; they're trying to protect their relationship with their dog and their mental health. So, the author is not in the wrong here. The neighbor needs to respect the dog's owner and communicate properly.\n"
