I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Asking...) scenario is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the author's neighbor has been regularly taking their dog without asking, to help distract her autistic son, Alex. The author is upset because they miss spending time with their dog and the dog has started developing bad habits. They mentioned they don't mind occasional requests but the neighbor is doing it daily without permission now. The friend told them they're being selfish, considering the challenges of raising a child with autism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights and responsibilities of both parties. The dog is the author's property and family member. They have specific routines and emotional reliance on the dog for their mental health. The neighbor, on the other hand, is trying to manage her son's needs, which is valid given autism can present challenges.\n\nBut the key points here are: the neighbor is taking the dog without asking, which is a boundary issue. The author didn't mind occasional use when asked, but now it's daily and uninvited. The dog is a family member, not just a tool for distraction. The change in the dog's behavior suggests that the way they're being handled might be contributing to that, which affects the author's ability to maintain their dog's training and their own mental health.\n\nThe neighbor's approach might be well-intentioned, but not respecting the author's boundaries by not asking first is problematic. The author has the right to set boundaries regarding their pet. The friend's comment about selfishness seems dismissive of the author's legitimate concerns about their mental health and the dog's well-being.\n\nSo, while the neighbor's situation is challenging, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries. The neighbor should have asked each time and respected the author's need for the dog's presence. The author's anxiety and depression are valid reasons to need the dog's company, and the dog's behavioral issues could be due to inconsistent training from multiple handlers.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their dog's companionship and to maintain its training. The neighbor should communicate better and seek permission, but the author is justified in addressing the situation.\n"
