I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a neighbor repeatedly taking the author's dog without permission to help her autistic son, leading to the dog developing bad habits and the author feeling deprived of time with their pet.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the neighbor initially asked for permission, and the author agreed. However, the neighbor now \"borrows\" the dog daily without asking. That seems like a breach of trust. The dog is a family member, and the author has specific emotional and mental health benefits from their time together. The fact that the dog is developing bad habits under the neighbor's care adds another layer of concern.\n\nThe neighbor's son has autism, and the author understands the challenges of raising a child with special needs. But that doesn't mean the author has to tolerate the dog being taken without consent. The key points here are consent and boundaries. The neighbor isn't asking anymore, which is a problem. The author's mental health is also a valid consideration, as the dog is a source of comfort and stress relief.\n\nThe friend's comment that the author is being selfish is a red herring. The author's well-being is just as important as the neighbor's needs. The neighbor should be respecting the author's property and boundaries. The dog's behavior changes suggest that the neighbor's handling might not be as effective as the author's routine. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries. They have a right to their dog and their mental health needs. The neighbor, on the other hand, is overstepping by not respecting the initial agreement. Therefore, the correct answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
