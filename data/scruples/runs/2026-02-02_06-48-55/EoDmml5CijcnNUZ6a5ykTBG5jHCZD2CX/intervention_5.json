I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a neighbor borrowing their dog regularly to help distract her autistic son. The original poster (OP) is conflicted because they love their dog and feel like their time with the dog is being taken away, but they also don't want to come off as selfish, especially considering the neighbor's son has autism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The neighbor is using the dog to help manage her son's behavior, which might be necessary for her to work or have some peace. On the other hand, the OP is the dog's owner and is experiencing stress and a loss of bonding time, which affects their mental health. The dog's behavior has also changed, which could be due to the neighbor's handling or the dog being overstimulated or not properly trained anymore.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The neighbor initially asked once, but now the son takes the dog without permission. That's a problem because the OP isn't consulted each time. The neighbor's friend said OP is being selfish, but that might not be fair because the dog is their pet and part of their family. The neighbor might not realize how important the dog is to the OP's well-being.\n\nAlso, the dog's new behaviors are a concern. If the neighbor isn't maintaining the dog's training, it's affecting the OP's home life. The OP has a right to address this, as the dog's behavior is impacting their quality of life. The neighbor might be well-meaning but isn't respecting the OP's boundaries by not asking each time and not considering the dog's training.\n\nIn terms of autism, the son might have difficulty understanding social boundaries, but the parent should be aware of that and manage it. The parent isn't excusing the son's actions but using his condition as a reason. The OP's mental health is a valid concern too, as they rely on the dog for stress relief.\n\nSo, is the OP in the wrong? They're not being selfish; they're advocating for their needs and the dog's well-being. The neighbor is overstepping by not asking and not addressing the dog's behavior. The OP's friend's comment is dismissive and doesn't acknowledge the OP's valid concerns. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
