I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting their neighbor to stop letting their autistic son \"borrow\" their dog.\n\nFirst, the main points from the situation: The author has a dog that's part of their family, and they provide a lot of care and attention. The neighbor's son, Alex, who is autistic, started taking the dog out daily without asking, leading to the dog developing bad habits and the author missing out on bonding time. The neighbor does this to manage her son's behavior and get some quiet time.\n\nThe author is concerned about their mental health and the dog's behavior. They mentioned that the dog used to be well-mannered but now has issues like begging and climbing on furniture. The friend's reaction was that the author is being selfish, not considering the challenges of raising a child with a disability.\n\nSo, the key here is balancing the neighbor's needs with the author's rights. The author's dog is their responsibility, and while the neighbor is trying to help her son, the dog's behavior is changing, and the author's well-being is affected. The neighbor isn't asking anymore; Alex is taking the dog without permission, which could be a boundary issue.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The neighbor's intentions are good, but the execution is problematic. The dog is a family member, and the author's mental health is part of the equation. The author isn't being selfish if they're not getting the support they need. The neighbor should communicate better and perhaps find other ways to help Alex. The author has the right to set boundaries for their pet's well-being and their own mental health. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
