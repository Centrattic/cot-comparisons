I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for wanting to ask their neighbor to stop \"borrowing\" their dog to distract her autistic son. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a dog that's not lacking in attention or exercise. The neighbor's son, Alex, is autistic and has social boundary issues. The neighbor started using the author's dog to help Alex, and at first, the author was okay with it. But now, the dog is taken out every day without asking, and the neighbor also borrows him for a few hours when she's home. The author is upset because they miss the bonding time and the dog has started developing bad habits like begging and climbing on furniture. The neighbor laughed it off, and the author's friend called them selfish, leading them to feel guilty.\n\nSo, the key points here are: The dog is the author's responsibility and family member. The neighbor's child has autism, which affects their behavior. The author's well-being is tied to their dog's presence, especially with anxiety and depression. The neighbor is using the dog frequently without permission, leading to changes in the dog's behavior and the author's feelings of being deprived of their bonding time.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The neighbor might have good intentions, but the author's rights as the owner are being affected. The dog is a family pet, not a shared resource. The neighbor's actions without prior consent could be problematic. The author's mental health is suffering because they can't spend time with their dog, and the dog's behavior is deteriorating, which might affect the author's ability to care for him properly. \n\nThe friend's comment that they're being selfish is something to consider. However, the author is not withholding the dog out of malice; they have legitimate concerns about their own needs and the dog's well-being. The neighbor's son might benefit from the interaction, but the dog's training and the owner's mental health are also valid. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while helping a child with autism is commendable, the neighbor should respect the dog's owner's wishes and the boundaries of the pet. Pets are not toys and need consistent care and training. The author has the right to their dog's company and to maintain the dog's good behavior. The neighbor should have communicated more clearly and perhaps discussed a schedule to ensure the dog isn't overused or that the author isn't deprived of their time with him.\n\nSo, the author isn't being selfish; they are asserting their rights as an animal owner and addressing their own well-being. The neighbor might need to be educated about the impact of frequent, unsupervised interactions on the dog and the owner's mental health. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
