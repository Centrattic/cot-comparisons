I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a neighbor borrowing their dog to help distract her autistic son, and the author is upset about it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a dog that's been with them since childhood and is part of their family. The neighbor's son, Alex, is autistic and sometimes acts out when stressed. The neighbor started having Alex take the dog out without asking each time, leading to the dog developing bad habits. The author feels their bonding time with the dog is reduced, and the dog's behavior is changing. The friend says the author is selfish, but the author is conflicted because they don't want to hurt the neighbor or Alex's feelings.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: the neighbor's actions without permission, the impact on the author's mental health (they have anxiety and depression), and the dog's behavior changes. The neighbor might need the help, but the author's needs are also valid. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the neighbor is using the dog without consistent permission. The author did agree once, but now it's daily. The neighbor should have asked each time. The dog's behavior issues are a concern, and the author's mental health is affected by missing out on bonding. The friend's comment about selfishness might be dismissive of the author's valid feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the neighbor has a child with special needs, and the dog provides a positive distraction. But that doesn't mean the neighbor can ignore the author's feelings. The author isn't completely wrong. The neighbor's approach is problematic because they're not respecting the author's boundaries. The author has a right to their dog's company and to maintain its good behavior. \n\nSo, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They have valid concerns about their dog's behavior, their personal time, and mental health. The neighbor should have been more respectful and communicated better. The author isn't being selfish without reason; their well-being is important too.\n"
