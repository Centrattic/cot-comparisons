I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a neighbor whose autistic son is frequently taking the author's dog without permission, leading to some behavioral issues in the dog and the author's personal distress.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The dog is a family member to the author, providing emotional support, especially with their anxiety and depression. The neighbor's son, Alex, is being allowed to take the dog out daily without prior consent, which causes the author to panic when they come home and find the dog missing. Additionally, the dog has started developing bad habits, like begging and climbing on furniture, which the author attributes to the neighbor's interactions.\n\nThe neighbor, on the other hand, is using the dog to distract Alex and has her own two dogs that are less active. She hasn't been asking permission each time, just sending Alex out without notice. The friend told the author they were being selfish, which is making them question their stance.\n\nNow, considering ownership and consent. The dog is the author's property, and while it's a family pet, the neighbor is using it regularly without asking. The initial incident where the neighbor asked to send Alex was okay, but now it's daily and without communication. The author has a right to their dog's presence and to manage their care, especially when it's affecting their mental health and the dog's behavior.\n\nThe neighbor's actions might be well-intentioned, but they cross boundaries by not seeking permission each time. The fact that the dog's habits have changed and the author's anxiety is being impacted means their needs are also valid. The author isn't being \"selfish\" by wanting to reclaim their personal time with the dog, especially since the neighbor could potentially use her own dogs or find other ways to engage Alex.\n\nThe friend's comment that the author is selfish ignores the emotional and psychological impact on the author. It's important to recognize that everyone has valid needs and boundaries, even when helping others. The author's concern about the dog's behavior and their own well-being is reasonable and not a matter of jealousy, but rather a need to maintain their own mental health.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their dog's company and to set boundaries regarding its care. The neighbor should have continued to ask for permission and be more considerate of the author's situation. The correct answer is B.\n"
