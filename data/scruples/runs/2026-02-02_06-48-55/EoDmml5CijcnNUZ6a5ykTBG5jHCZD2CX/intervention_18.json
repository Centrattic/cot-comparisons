I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the original question is in the wrong. The situation is about a neighbor borrowing their dog regularly to help distract her autistic son, but the author is upset because they miss their dog and the dog is developing bad habits.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The neighbor's son is autistic and can get stressed or bored, which the neighbor is trying to manage. The author initially allowed the dog to be taken once, but now it's daily without asking. The author is concerned about their mental health (anxiety and depression) relying on the dog for comfort and bonding time. Also, the dog's behavior has worsened, which they're worried about.\n\nThe friend told the author they're being selfish, which is a common reaction in such cases. The question is whether the author is actually in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the neighbor is trying to help her son, which is a legitimate concern. Autistic children can have sensory needs and may benefit from the presence of a dog. The neighbor's actions might be well-intentioned. However, the key issue is that the neighbor is now taking the dog without asking, which is a boundary that wasn't respected. The author has the right to set boundaries regarding their pet.\n\nThe author has valid reasons: their mental health is affected, and the dog's behavior is changing, which could indicate that the dog is either stressed or learning bad habits. The neighbor's lack of communication and the sudden increase in requests (from occasional to daily) might be overstepping. \n\nThe fact that the author mentioned the behavioral issues to the neighbor and she dismissed it by saying the dog climbs on her son's lap suggests a lack of consideration from the neighbor's side. The neighbor should be aware that the dog's training is important and that uncontrolled behavior can affect the owner's relationship with the pet.\n\nSo, while the neighbor has a valid need to help her son, she should respect the owner's boundaries and communicate properly. The author isn't being selfish if they're prioritizing their mental health and the well-being of their dog. The neighbor's actions, especially without permission, are the main issue here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
