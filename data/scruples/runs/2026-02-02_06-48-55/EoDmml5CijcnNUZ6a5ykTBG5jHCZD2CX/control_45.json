I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting their neighbor to stop \"borrowing\" their dog to distract her autistic son. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a dog they've had since childhood, who's getting older but still active. They provide the dog with plenty of exercise and attention. The neighbor has her own two less energetic dogs and a 12-year-old autistic son, Alex. The neighbor started having Alex take the author's dog out without asking, and sometimes the neighbor herself borrows the dog for hours. The author is upset because they miss bonding time with the dog, and the dog's behavior has deteriorated, like begging at the table and climbing on furniture.\n\nThe author's main points are about missing out on personal time with their dog, which helps with their anxiety and depression, and the dog's behavior issues. The neighbor seems to see it as a positive, even if the dog's manners are slipping. The friend called the author selfish, implying that they should consider the neighbor's needs more.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key here is the boundaries around the dog. The dog is the author's property and family member. The neighbor is using the dog without asking each time, which is a key issue. While the neighbor's intentions might be good for her son, the author has the right to set boundaries regarding their pet. The dog's behavior problems could be due to inconsistent training, possibly from the neighbor's handling. The author's mental health is also a factor\u2014they rely on the dog for emotional support. The neighbor might not realize the impact on the author's well-being and the dog's training. \n\nThe fact that the neighbor started this without ongoing consent (the initial okay was for one day, but now it's daily without asking) is a problem. The author isn't being selfish for wanting their dog's time back and ensuring the dog is trained properly. The author has the right to address this respectfully without being a \"dick,\" but they're not in the wrong for wanting to set those boundaries. The neighbor's actions are overstepping by not respecting the author's property and the established routine. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
