I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting their neighbor to stop \"borrowing\" their dog to help distract her autistic son. The scenario is complex, so I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They've had the dog for a long time and it's a significant part of their emotional support, especially with anxiety and depression. The dog's absence affects their daily routine and bonding time. Plus, the dog is developing bad habits now, which the author is concerned about.\n\nOn the neighbor's side, she has an autistic son who needs stimulation. She's using the dog to provide distraction so she can work. The author initially agreed to the arrangement but now feels it's gone too far. The neighbor hasn't asked permission each time, which the author finds problematic.\n\nThe friend's comment that the author is being selfish adds another layer. But the author is also experiencing stress and a loss of personal time. The key points here are consent and boundaries. The neighbor started with permission but now uses the dog daily without asking. The author's mental health is tied to their interaction with the dog, which is being disrupted.\n\nThe dog's well-being is another factor. If the dog is getting too much exercise or is confused by different handling, that's an issue. However, the neighbor's son's needs are valid too. But the author isn't the one causing the dog's behavior changes\u2014either the neighbor or the son might be.\n\nIn terms of rights, the dog is the author's property. They have the right to set boundaries on how their pet is used. The neighbor's actions, while well-intentioned, cross into the author's personal space and disrupt their care routine. The fact that the author's mental health is affected adds weight to their side.\n\nHowever, the neighbor's situation is challenging. Raising a child with autism can be difficult, and she's trying to manage. But she should also respect the author's boundaries. The initial agreement was for occasional use, not daily, unannounced borrowing. The author's request for the neighbor to stop isn't about jealousy but about reclaiming their time and ensuring proper care for the dog.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons to set boundaries, especially regarding their mental health and the dog's training. The neighbor should have asked for permission each time and been more considerate of the dog's routine and the author's needs.\n"
