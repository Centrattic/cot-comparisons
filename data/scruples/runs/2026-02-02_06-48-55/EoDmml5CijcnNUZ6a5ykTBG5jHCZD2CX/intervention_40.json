I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. So the scenario is about a neighbor borrowing the author's dog to help distract her autistic son, Alex. The author is upset because the dog is being taken without asking, leading to the dog's bad behavior and the author missing out on bonding time. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The neighbor's son has autism, which affects his behavior and social boundaries. The neighbor is using the dog to help manage Alex's needs when she's working from home. The author's dog is a family member, and the author has anxiety and depression that the dog helps with. The neighbor is borrowing the dog daily without permission, leading to the dog developing new habits and the author feeling distressed.\n\nThe friend says the author is being selfish, but the author feels conflicted because Alex loves the dog. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of rights, the dog is the author's property. The neighbor is using the dog without the author's ongoing consent beyond the initial permission. Even if the initial permission was given, the neighbor is now taking the dog daily without asking, which is a breach of boundaries. The author has legitimate concerns about their mental health and the dog's behavior changing. \n\nThe neighbor's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, are affecting the author's well-being and the dog's training. The fact that the dog is developing bad habits suggests that the neighbor might not be maintaining the same standards as the author. Also, the author's mental health is a significant factor here, and not being able to have their dog for comfort is impacting them negatively.\n\nSo, from a rights perspective, the author has every right to ask for the dog back. The neighbor's use of the dog without permission crosses a line, even if it's for a good cause. The author isn't being selfish; they're asserting their right to their property and their need for emotional support. The neighbor should have communicated better and perhaps found alternative ways to help Alex without overusing the dog.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
