I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Asking) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor borrowing their dog frequently to help distract her autistic son, leading to some issues for the author.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a dog that's a family member, and they have a routine for exercise and bonding, which is important for their mental health. The neighbor's son, Alex, started taking the dog without asking, and this has become a regular thing. The neighbor doesn't always ask, leading to the author finding the dog missing. The dog's behavior has also changed, which the author attributes to the neighbor's handling.\n\nThe author's main issues are losing their bonding time with the dog and the dog developing bad habits. The neighbor seems to be treating the dog as a tool to manage her son's needs, without considering the impact on the author. The friend's comment that the author is being selfish adds to their confusion.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The dog is the author's responsibility. They have the right to set boundaries about who interacts with their pet, especially regarding care and discipline. The neighbor isn't the dog's owner, so they shouldn't be making decisions about the dog's behavior or allowing it to develop habits that the owner disapproves of. The neighbor didn't ask for permission initially and hasn't been consistent in doing so, which is a problem. Also, the author's mental health is affected, which is a valid concern. It's reasonable to want to maintain their routine and the dog's well-being.\n\nThe neighbor might have good intentions, helping her son, but that doesn't override the author's rights. Raising a child with autism is challenging, but that doesn't mean others' needs should be ignored. The author isn't being selfish; they're advocating for their own well-being and the dog's proper care. The dog's new behaviors could be due to the neighbor's lack of training, which could be harmful in the long run. The author has the right to address this respectfully without being a \"dick,\" as they mentioned. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
