I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor borrowing their dog regularly to help distract her autistic son, and the author is conflicted about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has a dog that's part of the family, and they spend a lot of time with it every day. The neighbor, who has two less energetic dogs, started having her son take the author's dog out without asking, and this has become a daily occurrence. The author has anxiety and depression, and the dog is a source of comfort. Now, the dog is being taken away for extended periods, leading to the author missing out on their bonding time. Additionally, the dog has started developing bad habits, which the author attributes to the neighbor's son's influence.\n\nThe author's friend says they're being selfish, considering the challenges of raising a child with a disability. The author is unsure if they're overstepping by asking the neighbor to stop, especially since the dog seems to get extra attention.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the neighbor's unauthorized and frequent borrowing of the dog. The neighbor hasn't asked each time, which is a problem. The author has a right to their dog's companionship, especially as it's a significant part of their mental health. The neighbor's actions, even if well-intentioned, are taking away the author's access to their pet, which is impacting their well-being. The dog's behavior changes could also be a valid concern, as it might be due to inconsistent training from the neighbor's son.\n\nHowever, the neighbor's motivation is to help her son, which is understandable. But even with good intentions, repeatedly taking the dog without permission crosses a boundary. The author isn't being selfish; they're asserting their right to the dog's presence, which is a family member. The friend's comment about being selfish might not consider the author's mental health needs. The author's request to stop the uninvited borrowing isn't about jealousy but about reclaiming a necessary part of their routine.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a valid reason to ask the neighbor to stop, especially since the neighbor isn't respecting the dog as the author's property and the boundary of asking first. The answer should be B (No).\n"
