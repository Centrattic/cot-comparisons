I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor whose son is autistic and has been taking the author's dog without permission, leading to some behavioral issues in the dog and the author's distress.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The neighbor's son needs stimulation and is being distracting. The author has a dog that's part of their family, providing emotional support. The neighbor started using the dog to help manage her son's behavior. Initially, the author was okay with it, but now it's become a regular thing without asking. The dog's behavior has changed, and the author feels deprived of their own time with the dog.\n\nThe friend told the author they're being selfish, which adds another layer. But the author isn't being selfish if their mental health relies on the dog's companionship. The neighbor might not realize that the dog isn't a toy and that her son's actions are affecting the dog's behavior. The fact that the neighbor laughs and mentions the dog climbing onto her son shows a lack of concern about the dog's well-being. \n\nThe key points here are consent and the impact on the dog. The neighbor is allowing her son to take the dog without permission, which is a boundary issue. The author's mental health and the dog's training are being affected. The neighbor's need for quiet time is valid, but it shouldn't come at the expense of the author's well-being and the dog's proper care. The author is justified in wanting their dog back and setting boundaries. \n\nSo, the neighbor and the son are in the wrong for not respecting the author's property and the dog's training. The author is not being selfish; they're advocating for their emotional health and the dog's welfare. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
