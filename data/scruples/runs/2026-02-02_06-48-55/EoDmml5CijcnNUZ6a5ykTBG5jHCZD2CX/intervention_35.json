I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the scenario is about a neighbor who has been \"borrowing\" the author's dog daily without asking, to help distract her autistic son. The author's dog is part of their family and provides emotional support, especially for their anxiety and depression. The neighbor's son has been taking the dog out daily, leading to the dog developing bad habits and the author feeling deprived of their bonding time.\n\nThe author is considering asking the neighbor to stop but is conflicted, as their friend called them selfish, and they don't want to seem like a jerk. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my perspective.\n\nFirst, the dog is the author's property and family member. The neighbor's actions started as a one-time favor but have become a regular, unsolicited routine. The key issue here is consent. The neighbor initially asked once, but now the son is taking the dog daily without permission. The author's anxiety and mental health are being affected, and the dog's behavior is changing. \n\nThe neighbor's argument is about understanding the challenges of raising a child with a disability. However, the author's rights as the dog owner are also valid. The neighbor's actions, even if well-intentioned, are overstepping by not respecting the author's boundaries and not considering the impact on their mental health and the dog's well-being. \n\nThe friend's comment that the author is being selfish is a bit harsh. The author is not a child needing a toy; the dog is a living being that they care for and rely on. The neighbor should have been more considerate and discussed the regular borrowing, especially when the author's well-being is at stake. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to their dog's company and should communicate their needs. The neighbor's actions, while perhaps well-meaning, are crossing a line by not respecting the author's boundaries and the dog's proper care.\n"
