I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a neighbor who's letting her autistic son take the author's dog without permission. The author is upset because the dog is now being taken every day, leading to the dog developing bad habits and the author missing out on bonding time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The neighbor has a 12-year-old son with autism who needs stimulation. The author's dog is active, so maybe the neighbor sees this as a good way to keep Alex occupied. However, the neighbor isn't asking for permission each time anymore, which is a problem. The author mentions that initially, the neighbor asked, but now Alex just takes the dog daily without consent. This is a key point because consent is important here. The neighbor might be overstepping by not getting permission every time, even if her intentions are good.\n\nThen there's the author's perspective. They have anxiety and depression, and the dog is a source of comfort. The dog's changed behavior is affecting the author's mental health. The dog is part of their family, so the unauthorized borrowing is causing stress and a loss of bonding time. The neighbor's friend said the author is being selfish, but maybe that's not considering the impact on the author's well-being.\n\nThe neighbor's response when the author mentioned the bad habits was dismissive, laughing and saying the dog climbs onto Alex's lap. This doesn't show understanding of the author's concerns. It's possible the neighbor isn't aware of the rules the author has for the dog's behavior. Also, the dog's new habits like begging and climbing could be because Alex isn't enforcing the same training, leading to the dog acting out.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The neighbor's son is autistic, so she's trying to manage his needs. But the author's autonomy as a pet owner is also important. Pets are the responsibility of their owners, and allowing someone else to take them without permission can be seen as a breach of that responsibility. The neighbor should respect the author's boundaries and ask each time, especially if the frequency is becoming an issue.\n\nThe author's friend's reaction of calling them selfish is a bit harsh. The author isn't being unreasonable here. They're asking for their dog back when needed, which is valid. The neighbor might need to find alternative ways to engage Alex without using the dog as a tool without the owner's consent.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, they want to ask the neighbor to stop. That's a reasonable request given the circumstances. The author isn't being selfish; they're protecting their family member and addressing the negative consequences of the dog's unauthorized borrowing. The neighbor's actions are causing problems for the author, so it's within the author's rights to set boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're justified in wanting to get their dog back for their own well-being and to maintain proper training. The neighbor is overstepping by not respecting the author's boundaries after the initial request. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
