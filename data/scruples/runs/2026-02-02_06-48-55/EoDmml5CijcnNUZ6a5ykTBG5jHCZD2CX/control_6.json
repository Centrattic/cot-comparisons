I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a neighbor borrowing their dog regularly without asking, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The neighbor has an autistic son, Alex, who needs distraction. The author's dog is being taken out daily by Alex without permission. The neighbor isn't asking each time, so the dog is missing when the author gets home. The dog is also developing bad habits like begging at the table and climbing on furniture. The author's mental health is affected because they rely on the dog for comfort. The neighbor responds with a laugh, suggesting they don't take the behavior seriously. A friend called the author selfish, but the author feels conflicted.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is consent. The neighbor is taking the dog without each time asking, which is a problem. The dog is a family member, not a toy. The author has clear boundaries about their dog's care and their own need for the dog's presence. The neighbor might be trying to help their son, but that doesn't mean they can disregard the author's boundaries. The dog's behavior is also changing, which affects the author's ability to manage their pet as they did before. \n\nThe author's mental health is tied to their relationship with the dog. They're not just upset about losing time; they need that connection for their well-being. The neighbor's actions are causing harm to both the author and the dog's behavior. While the neighbor has a valid need to manage their son's behavior, they should have discussed it with the author first and respected their boundaries. The fact that the neighbor didn't ask each time and dismissed the author's concerns by laughing is a sign of disrespect.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They have a right to their dog's presence and to maintain its behavior. The neighbor overstepped by not respecting those boundaries. Answer B.\n"
