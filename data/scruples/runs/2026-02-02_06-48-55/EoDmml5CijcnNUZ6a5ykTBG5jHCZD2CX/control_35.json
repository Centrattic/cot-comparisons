I play rough with him in the garden or throw a ball around for maybe an hour a day, and he also gets walked twice a day for half an hour each and comes swimming with me whenever the weather's nice (which is most days). Suffice to say he's not lacking in attention or exercise.\n\nI have a neighbour who has two dogs of her own that are less energetic and prefer to lounge about in the sun rather than go adventuring. She also has a 12yo autistic son (Alex). He's a good kid but lacks some social boundaries and can fly off the handle when stressed out or bored. So one day my neighbour was working from home and was trying to keep him entertained so she could concentrate, and I got text saying, \"Hi! Hope it's okay but I sent Alex to walk your dog.\" I said it was all fine and told them to have fun, and I figured that was the end of it.\n\nNope. Alex now takes my dog out everyday (without asking, so I'll come home and find he's disappeared with the gate open and I'll panic), and then the neighbour will also \"borrow\" him for an hour or two whenever she's at home and needs to distract Alex. I really, really, really don't mind if she needs some quiet time and asks occasionally, since I'm sure my dog enjoys the extra attention.\n\nI've just got a few issues with some of it. One, my dog isn't a child's toy, he's a member of my family and I like having him close by. I have anxiety and depression and coming home to my dog bouncing around waiting for a walk is one of the few things that really destresses me. Now, I get home and he won't be returned to me until dinner time, and I miss out on bonding with him outdoors.\n\nTwo -- and I'm not sure whether this is the fault of the neighbour or Alex -- my dog has started developing bad habits since this whole routine started. He used to be very well-mannered, where you could drop a steak on the floor in front of his nose and he wouldn't eat it until you explicitly said he could. Now he begs at the table when he's inside, climbs onto my bed and couch without my permission (he's big and double coated, so he leaves hair everywhere), and will just generally behave in ways he wouldn't have dared to a month ago. I vaguely mentioned it when we were having drinks together the other night and my neighbour laughed and said, \"Oh he'll climb right onto Alex's lap on the couch.\" \n\nI complained about it to a friend last night and she said I was being selfish, since I don't understand what it's like to raise a child with a disability, and that it's not hurting anyone if my dog gets extra attention (even though he's not really, since it's cutting in my personal time with him). And now I feel bad, because I can see how much Alex loves my dog, and I don't really want to be a dick just because I'm jealous somebody else is spending time with him.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting their neighbor to stop \"borrowing\" their dog to distract the neighbor's autistic son. \n\nFirst, the author has a dog that's been part of their family for a long time. They take good care of the dog with regular exercise and attention. The neighbor, who has two less energetic dogs, started having her son take the author's dog out. Initially, the author was okay with it, but now it's become daily and without asking, leading to issues.\n\nThe main problems are: 1) The author is missing out on bonding time with their dog, which is important for their mental health. 2) The dog is developing bad habits, possibly due to the neighbor's son handling him. The neighbor isn't asking anymore and even jokes about the dog's behavior.\n\nThe friend's response is that the author is selfish, but the author feels conflicted because they see how much the child loves the dog. So, is the author in the wrong?\n\nWell, the dog is the author's property and family member. They have a valid reason to want control over their dog's care, especially since the neighbor isn't asking and the dog's behavior is changing. The neighbor is using the dog as a convenience without considering the owner's needs. Even if the intention is good (helping a child with autism), it's not the dog's role to be a constant tool for that. The author isn't being selfish if their well-being and the dog's proper care are at stake. The neighbor should respect the author's boundaries and ask before taking the dog. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
