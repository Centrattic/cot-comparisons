I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that someone drew their coworker for a Secret Santa gift, and the coworker got upset because she felt it made her look fat. The author thought it was a cute representation, like Steven Universe's style, and they put a lot of effort into it. But the recipient cried, and now coworkers are calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't know the giftee well, but they tried to make a personal gift based on her being a cat person. They included her body type as she is, which is overweight. The author's intention was to be kind and thoughtful, using a cartoonish style that's generally accepted as positive in shows like Steven Universe. But the recipient felt hurt and upset.\n\nNow, the key points here: body image is a sensitive issue. Even if the artist didn't mean any harm, the recipient's reaction is valid. The author might not have considered that including her actual body type could trigger negative feelings about her weight. While the intention was good, the outcome was hurtful. The author might argue that they were being truthful and that the style was flattering, but the recipient's experience is more important here. The coworkers are also critical, which suggests that there's a cultural or workplace sensitivity they might not have anticipated.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did put effort into making a personal gift and thought it was cute. They might not have malicious intent. However, the fact that the recipient was upset, even if unintentionally, means the author could have been more considerate. Maybe they should have thought about whether including body type in a drawing could be sensitive, regardless of the artist's intention.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. But generally, when someone's action causes emotional harm, even unintentionally, there's a responsibility to acknowledge that harm. The author might not be the \"worst,\" but they are in the wrong because they didn't consider the recipient's feelings and the potential impact. The answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because the action, though well-intentioned, caused harm and the artist should have been more thoughtful.\n"
