I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who drew the overweight coworker in their secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The person claims they drew her as she is, with her actual body type, intending it to be cute like in Steven Universe. However, the recipient was upset and cried, feeling it made her feel fat. The coworkers are now calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't make fun of the coworker's weight; they tried to represent her as she is, which is a positive intent. But the recipient was hurt. Why? Body image issues are sensitive. Even if the artist thought it was respectful, the recipient might feel self-conscious. The key here is the impact versus the intent. Intent is important, but the result is that the recipient was upset. \n\nIn social situations, especially in the workplace, it's crucial to be mindful of how others might perceive your actions. Even if the artist had good intentions, using a personal feature that someone is sensitive about can be problematic. The coworker's reaction indicates that she felt targeted or mocked, even if that wasn't the intention. \n\nHowever, the author didn't alter the body type to be unflattering or make fun. They mentioned it's similar to Steven Universe, which is known for diverse body types. So maybe the issue isn't about the body type itself but rather how it's perceived by the recipient. The author might not have considered her feelings about her body, which could lead to hurt feelings.\n\nBut then again, the author didn't make it malicious. They put effort into the gift and wanted to include a personal touch. The problem is that body image is a sensitive topic, and even well-meaning actions can backfire. The coworkers judging the author might not fully understand the situation, but the recipient's feelings are valid regardless of intent.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, they didn't intend harm. On the other hand, they didn't consider the recipient's potential sensitivity. The answer might depend on cultural norms and workplace dynamics. In some environments, representing someone's actual appearance is acceptable, but in others, it's a no-go. Since the recipient was hurt, the author might be in the wrong for not anticipating that reaction. However, others might argue that they aren't at fault since they had good intentions. \n\nI think the safest conclusion is that the author is at least partially responsible for not considering the recipient's feelings about their body. Even if it was respectful, the subject is sensitive, and the result was hurtful. So, the answer leans towards AITA (Answer A).\n"
