I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who drew an overweight coworker as overweight in a gift is in the wrong. The coworker was upset and cried, and now others are calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The gift was a secret Santa exchange. The author mentioned they didn't know the giftee well but knew she was a cat person. The drawing was done on shrinking paper, which then became an ornament. The key point is that the author depicted the coworker's actual body type, which is overweight. The coworker's reaction was emotional, feeling made to feel fat. The coworkers are now criticizing the author.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to create a personal and thoughtful gift, thinking it was cute and respectful, similar to the body type in Steven Universe. But the recipient felt hurt. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI should think about the principles here. In social interactions, especially in the workplace, there's a need to be mindful of others' feelings. While the author's intention was good, the outcome was negative. The issue might not be about the depiction itself but about the perception and how it made the recipient feel. Even if the drawing was respectful in the author's view, the recipient's emotional response indicates that they found it offensive or hurtful.\n\nBody image is a sensitive topic. People have varying levels of comfort with how their bodies are portrayed. The author assumed that representing the coworker's actual size was okay, but the recipient's reaction suggests that this was not the case. The author might have failed to consider the recipient's potential insecurities about their weight. Even if the coworker is overweight, depicting that in a gift could be seen as highlighting a trait that the recipient might be self-conscious about.\n\nWorkplace relationships require a degree of sensitivity. The coworkers' judgment of the author as an asshole implies that the action crossed a social boundary. Secret Santa gifts should be lighthearted and positive. Depicting someone's body type in a way that causes emotional distress could be seen as inconsiderate, regardless of the artist's intentions.\n\nHowever, the author did put effort into the gift and didn't intend to be unkind. But the key here is that the recipient's feelings are valid. Even if the author didn't mean harm, the act of drawing the coworker as she is might not be the best approach if it leads to hurt feelings. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but perhaps could have been more cautious. Maybe asking the coworker about their preferences or choosing a different representation would have been better.\n\nBut the coworker's reaction is strong. Crying and feeling upset suggests significant emotional impact. In such cases, it's important to prioritize the recipient's feelings. Even if the drawing wasn't intentionally offensive, the result is that the coworker felt targeted. The author might have the responsibility to recognize that and apologize, even if they don't see it as wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was good, the action resulted in harm. The question is whether the action was a mistake. Since the coworker was upset, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the potential impact on the recipient's self-esteem. However, there's nuance here. The answer could depend on cultural context, the specific workplace dynamics, and the coworker's personal history. But given the information, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't account for the recipient's feelings and the gift caused distress.\n"
