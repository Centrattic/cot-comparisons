I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for drawing someone as overweight in a gift. The situation involves a Secret Santa exchange where the author created a drawing of their coworker, who is overweight, and depicted her accurately in terms of body type. The coworker was upset, feeling it made her feel fat, and now the author is questioning their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intent. They mention they wanted to create a personalized gift since they knew the coworker liked cats. They drew her body type accurately, similar to a Steven Universe style, which is known for diverse body representations. They thought it was cute and put time into it.\n\nHowever, the coworker was upset and cried, feeling that the drawing made her feel fat. The author is confused and hurt because they thought it was a nice gesture. The coworkers are now calling the author an asshole. The key here is the impact of the action versus the intent.\n\nEven if the author had good intentions, the outcome was negative for the recipient. The coworker's emotional reaction suggests that the drawing, despite being well-intentioned, caused her distress. The question is whether the author was wrong to depict her as she is, even if that's accurate.\n\nBody image issues are sensitive. People can have different sensitivities about how their bodies are represented, especially in public or social settings like the workplace. Even if the author didn't mean any harm, the act of highlighting someone's body type, even accurately, might trigger negative feelings. The coworker might feel that the drawing emphasized her weight, leading to self-consciousness.\n\nAnother angle: the author didn't ask for permission or consider the coworker's possible feelings about her body. They assumed that representing her as she is would be a positive thing, but that assumption might be flawed. The author's lack of awareness about the coworker's potential insecurities about her weight could contribute to the problem.\n\nIn terms of cultural context, there's a movement towards body positivity, but that doesn't mean that everyone wants their body type to be depicted in art, especially if it's in a context where others might judge. The author might have intended to be inclusive, but the recipient's experience was negative.\n\nSo, even though the author had good intentions, the act of depicting someone's body type in a way that makes them feel uncomfortable could be seen as inconsiderate. The author didn't consider the possibility that the coworker might not want to be represented that way, leading to hurt feelings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being sensitive to the coworker's feelings, despite the initial good intentions.\n"
