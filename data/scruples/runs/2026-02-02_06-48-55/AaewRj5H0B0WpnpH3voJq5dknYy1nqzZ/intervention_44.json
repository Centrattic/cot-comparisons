I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for drawing their coworker as overweight in a secret Santa gift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker was described as \"overweight,\" but the drawing wasn't unflattering, just reflecting her body type. The person did it because they wanted to personalize the gift based on the coworker's love for cats. They thought it was cute and put time into it. However, the recipient was upset and even cried, feeling it made her feel fat, leading others to say the author was an asshole.\n\nNow, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are the intention of the author versus the effect it had on the recipient. The author's intention was positive\u2014they wanted to create a personalized, thoughtful gift. They didn't intend to hurt anyone, and the drawing wasn't exaggerated or unkind. However, the recipient felt hurt and self-conscious because of it. \n\nBody image issues are sensitive. Even if the drawing was neutral or positive in intent, someone who struggles with their weight might still find it triggering. The author didn't know the coworker well, so they might not have been aware of her feelings about her body. But the question is whether they were in the wrong regardless.\n\nEthically, even with good intentions, if an action causes harm, the person might be held responsible if they didn't take precautions. In this case, the author didn't consider that representing someone's body type could be hurtful. While they had good intentions, they might have overlooked potential sensitivities. \n\nOn the other hand, it's possible that the coworker has personal issues with her body that the author couldn't have known. The author didn't make fun of her weight, just represented her as she is. But the problem is that even a realistic representation can be hurtful if the person is self-conscious. \n\nThe coworkers who called the author an asshole might be overreacting, but the recipient's feelings are valid. In such situations, it's important to acknowledge the impact, even if the intention was good. So maybe the author is in the wrong not for the act itself, but for not considering the possible effects. \n\nAlternatively, the author might not be in the wrong because they had no malice, just a misunderstanding. The line between humor/personalization and harm can be blurry here. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the act was intentional harm versus a well-meaning but thoughtless act. Since the author didn't intend to harm, but the effect was harmful, it's a classic case of \"unintended harm.\" However, in the context of AITA, the community often considers both intent and impact. If the author could have reasonably anticipated the hurt, then they might share some responsibility. \n\nIn this case, the author didn't know the coworker's feelings about her weight, so they couldn't have known. However, body weight is a common sensitive topic, and maybe the author should have considered that. So perhaps the answer is A (the author is in the wrong), but it's a tough call. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because they didn't have ill intent and the coworker's reaction might be excessive. \n\nBut given that the recipient was upset and the author's action directly contributed to that, I think the AITA community would side with A. The author might be considered in the wrong because they didn't consider the potential impact, even if unintentional.\n"
