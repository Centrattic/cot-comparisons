I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for drawing their coworker as overweight in a gift. The situation involves Secret Santa, where the author drew a picture of the coworker (who is overweight) holding a cat, and the coworker was upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they didn't know the coworker well but knew she was a cat person. They tried to make a personalized gift, using her body type as a feature. They reference Steven Universe's body diversity, implying they meant it to be positive. However, the coworker felt hurt and even cried, leading others to criticize the author as an \"asshole.\"\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact. The author likely intended to be respectful and inclusive, using a body type that's stylized and not unflattering. However, the recipient's reaction was negative. Body image is a sensitive topic, and even if the intention was good, the impact on the recipient matters. The coworker might have felt that being depicted as overweight in a professional or semi-formal setting (Secret Santa at work) was making a point about her weight, which could be perceived as body-shaming or highlighting a feature that makes her uncomfortable.\n\nAnother angle is the workplace dynamics. Secret Santa is a social exchange, but colleagues might have different boundaries about personal topics. The author might not have considered that even a well-meaning artistic choice could cross a line if the recipient is sensitive about their weight. The fact that coworkers are calling the author an \"asshole\" suggests that the office culture might have norms against such depictions, even if unintended.\n\nHowever, the author is confused because they put effort into a thoughtful gift and didn't mean to harm. They might argue that they were being genuine and inclusive. But intentions don't erase the hurt caused. The question is whether the depiction is problematic regardless of intent. In many discussions about body image, the emphasis is on respecting individuals' feelings about their bodies, even if others might see it as a positive representation.\n\nAlso, considering that the coworker is \"rather large,\" the author's depiction might have inadvertently made her feel singled out or mocked for her size. Even if the drawing isn't unflattering, the choice to highlight her body type in a gift could be seen as focusing on an aspect she's self-conscious about. It's possible that in a workplace setting, where professional relationships are important, such a personal and potentially vulnerable topic is better avoided unless the recipient has expressed comfort with it.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions were good, the impact on the coworker was negative. The wrongness here isn't about malice but about not considering the recipient's sensitivity. So, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because respecting others' feelings and boundaries is crucial, even with good intentions.\n"
