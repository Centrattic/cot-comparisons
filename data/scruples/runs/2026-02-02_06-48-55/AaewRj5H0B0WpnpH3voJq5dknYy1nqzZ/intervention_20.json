I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The author made a secret Santa gift for a coworker, a drawing of her as an overweight girl holding a cat, with the intention of being cute, similar to the body types in Steven Universe. The coworker was upset, even crying, because it made her feel fat, and now coworkers are calling the author an asshole. The author is confused and hurt because they thought the gift was nice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker didn't know the author well, so the author might not have known about the coworker's feelings towards their body image. However, representing someone's actual appearance in a gift, especially when it's a sensitive topic like weight, can be tricky. Even if the intention was positive, the impact was negative. The coworker felt hurt and upset, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. The key points here are intent vs. impact. The author intended to create something cute and personal, but the result was offensive to the recipient. In such cases, even if the intent was good, the impact matters. The author should have considered the possibility that the coworker might be sensitive about their body image. Assuming that the coworker would appreciate the realistic representation might not have been the right approach, especially in a workplace setting where people might have different comfort levels with personal topics.\n\nAlso, the fact that the coworkers are now criticizing the author suggests that there's a workplace norm against such sensitive topics in gifts. Even if the author didn't mean harm, the action was perceived as hurtful, which can lead to being seen as in the wrong. The author should have perhaps asked the coworker about their preferences or chosen a different, more universally acceptable approach for a gift when they didn't know the person well.\n\nSo, while the author had good intentions, the lack of consideration for the coworker's potential feelings about their body image leads to the conclusion that they are in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
