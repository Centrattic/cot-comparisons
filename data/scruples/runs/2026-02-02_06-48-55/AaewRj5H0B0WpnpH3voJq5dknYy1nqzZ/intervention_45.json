I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person drew an overweight coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift. They thought it was cute and based on a body type like Steven Universe's characters. The coworker was upset, cried, and the author's coworkers called them an asshole.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is body image sensitivity. Even if the intention was positive, the recipient felt hurt. The author might not have realized how their coworker felt about their body. People have different comfort levels regarding how their body is portrayed, especially in a workplace setting. Even if the drawing wasn't unflattering, the act of highlighting someone's weight might be triggering for them. \n\nThe author's coworkers are also involved, which adds to the social pressure. The workplace environment can be tricky because it's a mix of personal and professional interactions. The author might not have considered the potential emotional impact, which is a common oversight in such situations. \n\nHowever, the author did put effort into the gift, choosing something related to the coworker's interests. The intention was thoughtful in terms of content, but the execution missed the mark emotionally. This is a classic case where good intentions don't negate the hurt caused. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the recipient's possible feelings about their body. It's possible the coworker has body image issues or has experienced weight-related teasing in the past. The author's lack of sensitivity here is a mistake, even if unintentional. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they were being honest and that the coworker should accept it. But honesty doesn't excuse insensitivity, especially when it's clear that the recipient was affected. The workplace isn't a space for potentially harmful honesty if it's not consensual. \n\nSo, weighing the intention against the impact, the author's action caused emotional harm. The question is whether that makes them in the wrong. Since they should have been more mindful of the recipient's feelings, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong). However, there's a nuance where the author might not have the intent to harm, but the result still counts.\n"
