I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a Secret Santa gift where someone drew a picture of their coworker as overweight, and the coworker was upset about it. The author is confused because they thought it was a nice and accurate representation, but their coworker felt hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider body image issues. The coworker went to the bathroom and cried because the drawing made her feel fat. That's a strong emotional reaction. Even if the author intended it as a positive or neutral thing, like in the style of Steven Universe characters with diverse body types, the recipient didn't receive it that way. The key here is intent versus impact.\n\nThe author mentions they didn't make it unflattering, just represented her body type. However, people's perceptions of their own bodies can be sensitive. Even if the drawing was accurate and not meant to be unkind, it's possible that the coworker was already self-conscious about her weight, and the drawing triggered negative feelings. The coworkers are also saying the author is an asshole, which might indicate a workplace culture where such representations are not acceptable, even if done with good intentions.\n\nAnother angle is the appropriateness of the gift. Secret Santa is supposed to be a fun, positive exchange. If the gift caused someone distress, even unintentionally, it's worth considering if the author should have chosen a different approach. The author put a lot of time into it, but the recipient's emotional well-being is important. Maybe the author didn't consider the recipient's personal feelings about their body image.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they were being genuine and respectful. But in workplace scenarios, especially with people you don't know well, it's important to be cautious about personal topics like body image. People's sensitivities can vary, and without knowing the coworker's feelings about their weight, the author took a risk. The fact that the coworker reacted so negatively suggests that the author's action crossed a line, even if not intending to be offensive.\n\nSo, weighing intent against impact, the author likely is in the wrong because the gift, while well-intended, caused emotional harm. The right choice would be to acknowledge the coworker's feelings and perhaps apologize, even if unintended. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
