Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who drew the overweight girl as overweight in their Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author didn't know their giftee very well but knew she liked cats. They drew a picture of her holding a cat, made it into an ornament. The person is described as \"rather large,\" and the author drew her body type as such. They mention it's nothing super unflattering, similar to Steven Universe's style, which I know has diverse body types. The author thought it was cute and put a lot of time into it. However, the giftee was upset, cried in the bathroom, and felt the drawing made her feel fat. Now the coworkers are calling the author an asshole, and the author is confused and hurt because they intended it as a nice gift.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to depict her as overweight. Let's consider the perspectives. The author intended no harm, maybe even a compliment by acknowledging her actual appearance. But the recipient took it as negative, leading to emotional distress. \n\nIn terms of body image issues, some people might find being depicted as they are uncomfortable, especially if they have insecurities about their weight. Even if the drawing is respectful, the act of highlighting their body type could be triggering. On the other hand, the author didn't use any offensive elements; it's just a representation. However, the intention versus the impact is a common dilemma here. The author thought it was cute, but the impact was hurtful.\n\nIn many cases, people with body image issues might avoid being depicted in art because of fears of being judged or made to feel self-conscious. Even if the artist didn't mean to be unkind, the act of being drawn as one's actual body can be a sensitive topic. The author might not have considered the recipient's possible feelings about their body, even if they tried to be respectful with the Steven Universe style.\n\nOn the flip side, altering someone's appearance in a gift might not be appreciated either. The author might feel they were being honest or personal. But since the recipient was upset, perhaps the author should have considered that not everyone wants their actual appearance represented, even kindly. It's possible the author was unaware of the recipient's feelings about their body size.\n\nAnother angle is that the author didn't ask the recipient beforehand if it would be okay to include their body type, which is a key point in respecting personal boundaries. Even if done with good intentions, making someone feel self-conscious about their appearance without their consent could be seen as crossing a line, especially in a workplace context where maintaining a respectful environment is important.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not considering the recipient's potential discomfort and not asking for their preference. The coworkers' reaction suggests that the workplace values sensitivity towards others' feelings, even if it wasn't malicious. The author's hurt feelings about the gift rejection are understandable, but the recipient's emotional well-being takes precedence here.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention was not harmful, the impact was negative. The author may be in the wrong for not anticipating the recipient's feelings and not respecting their possible boundaries regarding their body image. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
