Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they did a Secret Santa exchange and drew a coworker as an overweight girl on an ornament. The coworker got upset and cried, feeling that the drawing made her feel fat, and now coworkers are saying the author is an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentioned they didn't know the coworker very well but knew she was a cat person. They drew her body type as she is, which is overweight, but said it's not unflattering, similar to Steven Universe's style. They thought it was cute and put a lot of time into it. The coworker was unthrilled and felt hurt.\n\nThe key points here are about body image and personal sensitivity. Even if the author didn't intend to be offensive, the coworker felt hurt. The question is whether representing someone's actual body type in a drawing, even if done nicely, can be considered offensive. \n\nIn some cases, people might appreciate being represented accurately, especially if they feel underrepresented in media. However, others might feel self-conscious or hurt if their size is highlighted, even in a non-malicious way. The coworkers are also taking the coworker's side, labeling the author as an asshole, which suggests that in their workplace culture, this might be seen as inappropriate.\n\nBut the author's intention was to create a personalized gift. They didn't exaggerate or mock, just represented the person as they are. However, the outcome was hurt feelings. The issue here is about perspective and sensitivity. Even if the author had good intentions, the recipient's feelings are valid. The question is whether the author should have considered that representing someone's weight might be a sensitive issue, regardless of the depiction's style.\n\nIn terms of social norms, there's a debate about body positivity vs. personal comfort. Some might argue that it's okay to depict people as they are, promoting body acceptance, while others might say that in a workplace context, avoiding such representations is safer to prevent hurt feelings. The author might be in a tricky spot here because they didn't mean harm but caused distress.\n\nConsidering all angles, the answer might depend on cultural context and the specific sensitivities of the coworker. However, in many cases, if someone feels offended, the responsibility lies with the person who caused the offense, even if unintended. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not anticipating the coworker's possible reaction, despite good intentions.\n"
