I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who drew an overweight coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The key points here are intent, perception, and the context of the action.\n\nFirst, the person intended to create a thoughtful gift based on the coworker's interest in cats. They mentioned they didn't draw anything unflattering and compared it to Steven Universe's body types, which are generally more inclusive. However, the coworker was upset and felt it made her feel fat, even crying. The coworkers are now upset with the author, calling them an asshole.\n\nNow, the main question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The argument for AITA (Am I the Asshole) often hinges on whether the action was intentionally hurtful or if the person failed to consider how it might be received. The author didn't intend to be mean, but they might not have considered that representing someone's body type, even accurately, could be offensive. Body image issues are sensitive, and even if the drawing was accurate, it might trigger negative feelings if the person is self-conscious about their weight.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't alter the drawing to misrepresent the coworker. They tried to make it cute and respectful. But in social interactions, especially in the workplace, it's important to be mindful of others' feelings. Even if the intention was good, the result caused emotional distress. The coworkers' reaction suggests that the drawing was inappropriate in this context.\n\nAdditionally, the author put time into the gift, which shows effort, but effort doesn't excuse potential harm. The key is whether the action crossed a boundary. Since the coworker was upset and felt uncomfortable, the author might have overlooked the sensitivity around body image. Even if others don't see it as unflattering, the person who received it did, which matters.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author didn't have malicious intent, they failed to consider how the gift might be received, leading to hurt feelings. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because they caused emotional harm despite good intentions.\n"
