I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for drawing their coworker as overweight in a gift. They did a secret Santa exchange, and the coworker was upset because she felt it made her feel fat. The coworkers are now calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider body image issues. Drawing someone as their actual size is a sensitive topic because body image can be a big deal for people. Even if the artist didn't mean to be unkind, the coworker took it as a negative thing. The author thought it was cute, like Steven Universe's style, which is more about character design than mocking. But maybe the coworker has a different perspective. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. The coworker felt hurt, and the author put a lot of effort into the gift. But maybe they should have considered the coworker's feelings. Even if the drawing wasn't unflattering, representing someone's weight can be a sensitive issue. The author didn't know the coworker well, so maybe they should have assumed a safer approach. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might be overreacting if the drawing was just a realistic portrayal. However, the key point here is that the coworker felt bad, leading to her crying. The author's intention was positive, but the outcome was negative. In such cases, even if the intention was good, the impact matters. \n\nSo, considering the coworker's reaction and the fact that body image is a sensitive topic, the author might be in the wrong for not anticipating how the coworker would feel. The answer might be A. But I'm a bit conflicted because the author had good intentions.\n"
