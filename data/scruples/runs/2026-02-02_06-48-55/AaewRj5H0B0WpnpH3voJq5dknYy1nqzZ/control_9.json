I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for drawing an overweight coworker as overweight for a Secret Santa gift. They made an ornament with her holding a cat, and they mentioned it's in a style similar to Steven Universe, which I know uses diverse body types. The coworker was upset and cried, feeling it made her feel fat.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to be nice and put in effort, but the result hurt someone's feelings. The coworkers are calling them an asshole, which is a red flag. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was negative. The key here is whether representing someone's actual body type can be considered offensive. \n\nIn society, body image is a sensitive topic. Even if it's a flattering depiction, some people might still feel uncomfortable. The fact that the coworker was upset suggests that the author didn't consider her possible insecurities about her weight. The author might not have realized that representing her as overweight could trigger negative feelings, even if it's not unflattering. \n\nThere's a difference between intending to be respectful and the actual impact. The coworkers' reactions also matter here. If others are saying the author is wrong, maybe there's a cultural or social norm they're not aware of. It's possible that in a workplace setting, such a personal gift could be seen as inappropriate if it's based on physical appearance. \n\nHowever, the author didn't mean to be unkind. But intention vs. impact is important. Even with good intentions, if the action causes harm, the person should take responsibility. The author might need to apologize and learn from the mistake. So, while the author might not be a complete asshole, they are in the wrong for not foreseeing the emotional impact. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
