I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type.

Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who drew an overweight coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa ornament is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person made a gift, a drawing of their coworker holding a cat, and they included her body type as she is. They thought it was cute, like Steven Universe characters. But the coworker was upset, cried, and now the author's coworkers are calling them an asshole. The author is confused because they put effort into the gift and didn't think it was unflattering.\n\nHmm. The key points here are body image sensitivity and intent vs. impact. The author's intention was to represent the coworker accurately, but the result hurt her feelings. The question is whether that's the author's fault.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author didn't mean to be mean. They tried to be respectful by making it cute. On the other hand, the coworker felt fat, which is a valid emotion. Body image issues can be really sensitive, and even well-intentioned actions can cause hurt.\n\nAlso, the coworkers are now blaming the author, so there's social pressure here. Maybe the workplace culture has a different standard. But the author might not have known about the coworker's feelings about her body. It's possible the coworker is sensitive about her weight, and the author didn't realize that.\n\nBut then, the author chose to include her body type. Even if it's just representing as it is, some people might not appreciate being reminded of aspects they're self-conscious about. So, maybe the author should have considered that and chosen a more idealized version to avoid causing hurt.\n\nHowever, the author didn't add any negative elements, just depicted her as she is. The problem is the coworker's reaction. But in such cases, intent matters but not as much as the impact. Even if the intent was good, the result was harmful. So, the author might be in the wrong for not anticipating how their coworker would feel.\n\nBut wait, is it the author's fault if they didn't know? They didn't have a bad intention. Maybe the coworker has personal issues, and the author can't be blamed for that. It's a tricky line. The question is whether the action itself is wrong, regardless of the coworker's sensitivity.\n\nIn terms of social norms, representing someone's body type accurately isn't inherently wrong, but if it causes emotional harm, then perhaps the author should be more cautious. Maybe the author should have drawn her as thinner to avoid any potential issues, even if it's not accurate. But that's a form of lying or pretending, which also isn't great.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not considering the coworker's possible insecurities and proceeding without checking if that would be okay. But the coworker didn't indicate prior that she wouldn't want to be depicted as she is. The author acted on their own judgment, which was incorrect in this case.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author didn't have ill intent, they might be in the wrong because their action resulted in the coworker feeling hurt. The right approach might have been to avoid depicting body types or to seek permission beforehand. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
