I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for drawing their coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author drew a coworker as her actual body type in a small ornament. They mentioned she's a cat person, so the drawing includes her with her cat. The coworker was upset, cried, and felt the drawing made her feel fat. Now coworkers are calling the author an asshole, and the author is confused because they thought it was cute and respectful, like the Steven Universe style.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A (yes) or B (no).\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respect and sensitivity in art. The author intended to be accurate and kind, but the recipient took offense. The question is whether the author had the right to depict her body type given the context of a Secret Santa gift. \n\nIn many cases, body image is a sensitive topic. Even if the intention was good, representing someone's body type in a personal gift might be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if the person isn't close to the recipient. The coworker didn't know the author well, so maybe the author shouldn't have assumed it was okay to draw her body as is. \n\nAlso, the coworkers are now criticizing the author, which suggests that in their workplace culture, such a depiction is considered inappropriate. Even if the author meant it as a compliment, the perception matters. The coworker felt hurt, so the author's action led to negative consequences. \n\nHowever, the author put effort into the gift, thinking it was thoughtful. The intent was to personalize it, which is generally a good thing. But perhaps the execution was problematic. The line between respectful and offensive can be thin, especially with body types. \n\nSome might argue that it's not the author's place to decide how someone's body should be represented without consent. Even if the author thought it was accurate, the recipient's reaction shows it wasn't received well. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the potential sensitivity and the recipient's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author didn't alter the body type, they might be accused of being insincere or making the person feel objectified. But again, the reaction suggests that the recipient felt targeted. \n\nIn AITA posts, community often emphasizes empathy and considering others' feelings. So, even if the author had good intentions, the outcome was harmful. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
