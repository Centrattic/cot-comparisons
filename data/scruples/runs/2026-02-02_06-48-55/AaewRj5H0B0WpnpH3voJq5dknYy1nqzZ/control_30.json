      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who drew an overweight coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift was in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author made a drawing for a Secret Santa exchange. The coworker is described as \"rather large,\" and the author included their body type in the drawing. The coworker was upset, crying in the bathroom because they felt the drawing made them feel fat. Now, the coworkers are calling the author an asshole for it. The author is confused because they thought the drawing was cute and tried to represent a body type like Steven Universe's, which is a show known for diverse character designs. They put a lot of effort into it and feel it was a nice gesture, but the recipient didn't take it that way.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault (AITA). The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. I need to consider the context and the possible reasons for the coworker's reaction. While the author might have intended to be inclusive or even compliment the coworker by accurately representing their body type, the recipient felt hurt and self-conscious. In a professional setting, even if it's a Secret Santa exchange, the line between personal expression and potential insensitivity can be blurry. \n\nBody size is a sensitive topic, and not everyone wants their body type to be highlighted, even if it's accurate. The coworkers' reaction suggests that the drawing was perceived as offensive. The author might have underestimated the emotional impact of depicting someone's physique, especially in a workplace where people might prefer to keep such aspects private. \n\nAlso, the fact that the coworker didn't know the author well could be a factor. If the recipient is already in a position where they feel self-conscious about their weight, an accurate depiction might make them feel exposed or judged. Even if the creator didn't mean to be cruel, the effect on the recipient matters a lot. \n\nThe author's defense is that they put time into the gift and thought it was nice. But intention vs. impact is a common point of contention in these situations. The key here is whether the representation was respectful. The user mentioned it was \"cute\" and similar to Steven Universe's body types, which are generally well-received. However, the recipient's experience was negative, so the author's good intentions might not absolve them of the hurt caused.\n\nWorkplace dynamics are also important. Secret Santa is a social event where people expect kindness and thoughtfulness. Even if it's a drawing, being in a professional environment, the coworkers might be more protective of each other's feelings. The author didn't consider the possibility that the coworker might not appreciate the body type being highlighted, regardless of the intent.\n\nAnother angle: The drawing was on an ornament, which is a gift. Including accurate body representation in a gift can be seen as tokenistic or as an attempt to mock, especially if the recipient isn't comfortable with it. The author might have made a well-meaning mistake but still crossed a line.\n\nIn some cases, people appreciate accurate representation, but there's also a strong movement against fat-shaming. However, the recipient's reaction here was negative, so the author's choice, even if unintentional, led to harm. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they should have considered the recipient's feelings and potential sensitivities about their body image. Even if the intent was good, the impact was negative, and in a workplace, being considerate about such matters is crucial. The coworkers' judgment supports that the action was inappropriate.\n"
