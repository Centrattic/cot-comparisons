I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for drawing an overweight coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift. The author made an ornament drawing of the coworker, who's a cat person, and included her body type as she is. The coworker was upset, cried, and others are calling the author an asshole. The author feels hurt because they put a lot of time into the gift.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author intended to be honest and kind, maybe thinking it would be a positive representation, like the Steven Universe style. But the coworker was offended and felt it made her feel fat. So the key points here are about intent vs. impact, and whether representing someone's actual body type can be hurtful even if done with good intentions.\n\nBody image issues are real for many people. Even if the author didn't mean any harm, the act of highlighting someone's weight in a personal gift might be triggering. Secret Santa is a personal gift, so the coworker might have perceived it as a personal comment on her body. The author's coworkers are also involved, so there's a workplace context where maintaining respectful interactions is important.\n\nI should also think about cultural context. In some workplaces, there's a sensitivity around body image, and even well-meaning gestures can be problematic. The author didn't know the coworker well, so maybe they didn't realize how sensitive the coworker was to her weight. However, the coworker might have felt that the drawing was a public acknowledgment of her weight, which could be embarrassing.\n\nAnother angle: the author could have asked for consent before creating the artwork. But since it's a Secret Santa, that's not possible. So the author had to make a judgment based on what they knew. However, the outcome shows that the judgment was incorrect in this case.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the author should have anticipated the coworker's reaction. Even if the author's intent was positive, the impact was negative. In such cases, the responsibility often falls on the person causing harm to consider the impact, even if the intent was good. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the potential for the artwork to hurt, even if unintentionally. Therefore, the answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
