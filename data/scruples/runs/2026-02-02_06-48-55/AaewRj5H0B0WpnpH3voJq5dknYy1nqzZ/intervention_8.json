I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about Secret Santa where someone drew a picture of their coworker as overweight and made an ornament out of it. The coworker was upset and cried, feeling that it made her feel fat, and now the author is being called an asshole by others.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author intended to create a gift based on the coworker's interest in cats. They depicted the coworker's body type as she is, but the recipient felt it was unflattering and hurtful. The author thought it was cute and well-meaning, but the outcome was negative.\n\nNow, body image is a sensitive topic. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the action caused emotional distress. The question is whether that makes them at fault. The author might argue that they were being honest or respectful, but in reality, using someone's physical appearance as a focal point in a gift without their consent can be problematic. Especially in a professional setting, coworkers might have varying levels of comfort with personal topics. The coworker might not have shared that she feels self-conscious about her weight, so the author might not have been aware. However, the responsibility here is to consider potential sensitivities and avoid actions that could harm someone's self-esteem.\n\nThe author could have avoided the issue by choosing a different representation. For example, focusing on the cat aspect more, or using a generic figure without specific body traits. The fact that coworkers are calling the author an asshole suggests that there's a social expectation to avoid such depictions, even unintentionally. The emotional impact on the recipient is significant\u2014crying is a strong reaction\u2014indicating that the action crossed a line.\n\nOn the other hand, the author put time and effort into the gift, thinking it was nice. They might not have realized the sensitivity of the issue. However, ignorance of the recipient's feelings doesn't absolve them of responsibility. The key here is that the action caused harm, regardless of intent. In such cases, the intent doesn't mitigate the impact. Therefore, the author's actions were inconsiderate and hurtful, making them at fault.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
