I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking if the person who drew the overweight coworker as such in a Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The person says they included the body type to be accurate, but the coworker was upset and cried, feeling it made her feel fat. The coworkers are now calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author thought they were being kind and accurate by representing the coworker as she is. They mentioned it's similar to Steven Universe's body diversity, which is generally seen as positive. However, the coworker had a negative reaction, which suggests that the action didn't come across as intended.\n\nNext, the context. Secret Santa is a friendly exchange, so the coworker might expect a gift that's light-hearted and positive. The drawing was a personal item (an ornament), so it's a permanent representation. Even if the artist's intention was neutral, the coworker might have felt it was mocking her body image. Body image issues are sensitive, and even well-meaning actions can cause hurt if the recipient is self-conscious about their weight.\n\nThe coworkers' reaction is also a factor. They say the author is an asshole, which implies a workplace culture where body neutrality or weight representation is a touchy subject. The author might not have considered the potential for the coworker to be self-conscious about her weight, especially if they didn't know her well. In that case, the artist might have overstepped by including a physical trait that's sensitive to the recipient.\n\nBut on the other hand, altering the drawing to make her thin when she's not could be considered dishonest or inauthentic. The artist might feel they were just being truthful. However, in gift-giving, especially with personal items, the recipient's comfort is paramount. If the gift caused emotional distress, even unintentionally, the artist might share some responsibility.\n\nSo, the key points are intent vs. impact. The artist's intent was to be kind and accurate, but the impact was negative. The question is whether the artist should have anticipated the sensitivity around the coworker's weight. Since they didn't know her well, they might not have been aware of her feelings about her body. However, in a workplace setting, it's often better to err on the side of caution regarding such personal details unless the recipient has expressed comfort with it.\n\nUltimately, the decision hinges on whether the artist's action was inappropriate regardless of intent. If the coworker was hurt, and the artist's choice to include her body type led to that, then the artist might be at fault for not considering the potential for that to be hurtful. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
