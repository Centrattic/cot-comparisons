I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're at fault for drawing their Secret Santa recipient as overweight in a gift. They mentioned that the recipient is a big cat person, so they drew her holding a cat and made it into an ornament. The person included her actual body type, similar to how Steven Universe characters represent different body sizes, but the recipient was upset and felt it made her feel fat. Now the coworkers are saying the author is an asshole, which is making them feel hurt too.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are intention versus impact. The author thought it was a nice, personal touch to include her body type, seeing it as a realistic and positive representation. However, the recipient took it as negative and it caused emotional distress. Even if the intention was good, the result was hurtful. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI know that in many situations, especially regarding body image, people can have different sensitivities. What one person sees as a neutral or positive depiction, another might see as a negative reminder of their insecurities. Body image issues are real and can be deeply personal. Even if the author didn't mean to offend, the act of highlighting someone's weight in a gift might inadvertently trigger negative feelings, especially if the person is already self-conscious about it.\n\nThe coworkers are calling the author an asshole because they see the act as hurtful, regardless of intent. The author is hurt because they put effort into the gift. But the main issue here is whether the action was wrong. Since the recipient was harmed, even if unintentionally, the author should consider that they might have been inconsiderate. The fact that the recipient cried shows the impact was significant. \n\nIn cases like these, it's often about empathy and understanding that people have different feelings about their body. The author might not have realized the sensitivity here, but it's their responsibility to be cautious, especially in a professional setting where they don't know the recipient that well. Maybe the author should have opted for a more universally flattering style or avoided the body type detail altogether to prevent any potential hurt. \n\nSo, even though the intention was good, the result was hurtful. Therefore, the author is at least partially at fault for not considering how the depiction might be received. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
