I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who drew the overweight girl as she is in the secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The coworker was upset and cried because the drawing made her feel fat. The author thought it was a kind gesture, using a cute style similar to Steven Universe. But the coworker had a negative reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't know the giftee well, but knew she liked cats. They put effort into making a personalized ornament. The coworker's reaction is significant\u2014going to the bathroom and crying. That's a strong emotional response. Even if the author intended it as a compliment, the recipient felt hurt. \n\nThe key issue is whether body-shaming occurred. The coworker is overweight, and the author depicted her as such. Even if it's done with a cartoonish, \"cute\" style, the act of highlighting someone's weight might be sensitive. In many modern contexts, people are more aware of body image issues. The author might not have considered that the coworker could be self-conscious about her weight. \n\nThe coworkers are also saying the author is an asshole, which adds social pressure. But the author felt hurt because they put time into the gift. However, the recipient's feelings might take precedence here. Intentions matter, but so does the impact. Even if the intention was to be kind and realistic, the result was hurtful.\n\nAnother angle: Is it wrong to draw someone as they are? If the coworker wanted to be depicted accurately, then maybe not. But if the depiction made her feel bad, then the author might have failed to consider her feelings. The question is about being in the wrong, not about the coworker's sensitivity. \n\nIn many cases, if your action causes someone distress without a clear understanding of why it might be sensitive, you could be in the wrong. The author didn't know the coworker well, so maybe they didn't realize the weight issue was a trigger. However, the coworker's reaction is valid. The author might have assumed it was a neutral representation, but without knowing the recipient's comfort level with their body image, it's a risk. \n\nThe answer hinges on the balance between intent and impact. Since the impact was negative and the author didn't consider the potential sensitivity around body image, they are likely in the wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes).\n"
