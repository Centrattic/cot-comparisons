I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for drawing their coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift. The coworker was upset and cried, feeling that the drawing made her feel fat. The coworkers are now calling the author an asshole, but the author is hurt because they put a lot of time into the gift and thought it was nice.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are about body image and sensitivity. The author intended to be respectful, using a Steven Universe-like style, which is known for its positive representation of diverse body types. However, the recipient was offended. The question is whether the author was wrong to represent the coworker's actual body type in the drawing.\n\nBody image issues are very personal and can be sensitive. Even if the artist intended no harm, the recipient's reaction is valid. The author might not have realized how the drawing affected the coworker. However, the author also had the intention of being kind and thoughtful. \n\nIn such cases, it's important to consider both perspectives. The author might not be in the wrong if they had no malicious intent, but they could still have been unaware of how their action would be received. However, the coworker's feelings are real, and the author should reflect on whether they should have considered a different approach. \n\nIn many social contexts, people are encouraged to be mindful of others' insecurities, especially in workplaces. Even with good intentions, the drawing might have triggered a negative reaction. The coworkers judging the author might be emphasizing sensitivity, which is a common expectation nowadays. \n\nSo, deciding between A and B. If the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. If B, they aren't. The complexity here is that the author's intent was good, but the outcome was hurtful. In such cases, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong for trying to be inclusive, but perhaps they should have chosen a different representation. However, many would argue that the author's intent doesn't negate the harm caused. \n\nBut considering that the artist didn't intend to mock and used a positive style, maybe the answer leans towards B. However, the coworker's reaction is significant. Different people have different thresholds for body image issues. The author might not have known, so it's a judgment call. But in the context of AITA, the community often sides with the person who didn't mean harm but still caused hurt. So maybe the answer is A because the author was wrong to draw her as she is if it made her feel bad. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Alternatively, if the author had no malicious intent and tried to be respectful, maybe B. \n\nHmm. The key is whether representing someone's actual body type in a gift is acceptable. If the coworker is sensitive about her weight, then the author might have been careless. So the answer could be A. But if the author had a good intention and the coworker's reaction is due to personal insecurities, then B. It's a tricky balance. In AITA cases, the community often looks at intent and the recipient's feelings. If the recipient was harmed, even without malice, the person might be considered at fault for not anticipating the reaction. So maybe A is the answer.\n"
