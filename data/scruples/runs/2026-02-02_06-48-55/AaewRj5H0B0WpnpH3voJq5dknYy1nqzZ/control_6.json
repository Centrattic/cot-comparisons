I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who drew an overweight coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa ornament is in the wrong. The situation is a bit tricky because it's about body image and unintentional hurt feelings.\n\nFirst, the person made a gift based on what they knew about the coworker\u2014she's a cat person. They drew her holding a cat, and since she's overweight, they included that in the drawing. They mention it's similar to a Steven Universe style, which is known for diverse body types. They thought it was cute, but the recipient was upset and cried, feeling that it made her feel fat. Now the coworkers are calling the gift-giver an asshole, and they're confused because they thought the gift was thoughtful.\n\nI need to consider a few angles here. Body image issues are real and sensitive. Even if the intention was positive, the recipient's reaction shows that the gesture was hurtful. The question is whether the intention matters or if the impact is what's important. In many cases, especially in the context of workplace relationships, the impact on the recipient can make the action problematic, regardless of intent.\n\nAlso, the coworker didn't know the person well, which might mean they didn't know about her feelings about her weight. It's possible that the coworker didn't intend to be unkind, but the act of highlighting someone's body type, even in a cartoonish way, could be seen as focusing on a sensitive aspect of their identity. The fact that the recipient felt the need to cry indicates a significant emotional impact.\n\nOn the other hand, the gift-giver put time into a personalized gift, which was well-intended. They might not have realized the sensitivity around body image. However, in a workplace setting, it's important to be mindful of colleagues' feelings and potential triggers. The coworkers' reaction suggests that the drawing crossed a line, especially since the recipient was distressed.\n\nAnother point is that while representing diverse body types in media (like Steven Universe) is positive, the context here is personal and the recipient's perception is key. The coworker might not have seen it as a positive representation but as a focus on their weight, which can be hurtful. The line between a positive representation and a hurtful one can be thin, especially in personal gifts where the recipient might feel scrutinized.\n\nSo, considering all this, even if the intention was good, the result was hurtful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the recipient's potential sensitivity to their body image.\n"
