I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for drawing an overweight coworker as such in a Secret Santa gift. The scenario is that the coworker was upset, cried, and others are calling the author an asshole. The author is confused because they thought it was cute and tried to be respectful with the body type.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The gift was a drawing for a Secret Santa exchange. The author drew their coworker as she is\u2014overweight\u2014but the coworker was offended. The key points here are the intent, the perception, and the impact.\n\nThe author's intent was to create a personalized gift based on the coworker's interests (cats) and to represent her accurately. They mentioned using a Steven Universe style, which is known for body-positive representation. However, the coworker's reaction was negative, leading to emotional distress.\n\nNow, even if the author's intention was positive, the impact on the recipient matters. The coworker felt hurt and made to feel self-conscious about her weight. Body image issues can be sensitive, and even well-meaning representations might trigger negative feelings. The coworkers' reactions also suggest that the author overstepped, so there's a social judgment here.\n\nThe author might argue that they were honest and didn't mean any harm. But in social interactions, especially in a workplace, it's important to consider how others might perceive actions beyond just the creator's intent. The question is whether the author should have anticipated that depicting someone's body type could be offensive. Since the coworker was upset, the author's actions did cause harm, regardless of intent.\n\nAdditionally, the author is now facing backlash from coworkers, which indicates that the workplace norms consider this a problem. Even if the author didn't have malicious intent, the act of highlighting someone's appearance in a way that makes them uncomfortable could be seen as insensitive.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to be cruel, the result was hurtful. In such cases, the responsibility often lies with the person who caused the harm, even if unintentionally. The author should have considered the potential impact and perhaps opted for a more neutral representation to avoid making the coworker feel self-conscious.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong), as their actions, though well-intentioned, resulted in harm and they should have been more considerate of the coworker's feelings regarding their body image.\n"
