I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who drew an overweight coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The main issue here is whether the drawing was offensive or not.\n\nFirst, the person drew their coworkee, who is overweight, in a way that reflected her body type, but described it as \"not super unflattering\" and similar to Steven Universe's style. They thought it was cute and put effort into it. The coworkee was upset and cried, feeling it made her feel fat, leading others to call the gift-giver an asshole. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. Body image issues are sensitive. Even if the intent was good, the recipient's reaction matters. The author might not realize that portraying someone's body as is can be triggering if the person has insecurities. Even if it's respectful, the act of drawing someone's body type might be hurtful. The key points here are intent vs. impact. The author's intention was to create a personalized gift, but the impact was negative. \n\nAlso, the context is a workplace. Work relationships can be delicate, and even if it's a Secret Santa, coworkers might have different boundaries. The author didn't know the coworkee well, so maybe they didn't understand her feelings about her weight. In such cases, it's important to consider how others might perceive the action, even if the intent was positive.\n\nHowever, the author isn't making fun of her; they're just representing her as she is, which could be seen as honest but perhaps insensitive. There's a line between respectful depiction and causing emotional harm. The fact that the coworkee was upset enough to cry suggests the impact was significant. The coworkers' reaction also adds to the pressure on the author. \n\nIn many such cases, the focus is on the effect on the recipient rather than the intent. Even if the author meant well, the outcome was hurtful. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the potential sensitivity of the subject and how it could affect the coworkee. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the impact on the recipient is what matters most here, regardless of the intention.\n"
