I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for drawing their overweight coworker as overweight in a secret Santa gift. The author made an ornament with a drawing of the coworker, who is a big cat person, holding a cat. The coworker became upset and cried because the drawing made her feel fat, and coworkers are calling the author an asshole.\n\nSo first, I need to determine if the author's actions were inappropriate. The key points here are body image and the intent behind the drawing. The author said they drew her body type as it is but in a cute way, similar to Steven Universe's style. Steven Universe does portray characters with various body types, which is generally seen as positive and inclusive. However, the coworker took offense, feeling that the drawing highlighted her weight in a negative way.\n\nThe author's intention was to create a personalized and thoughtful gift, but the recipient's reaction was hurt and feeling fat. Even if the intention was neutral or positive, the impact on the recipient is what matters here. In workplace environments, it's important to be mindful of how others might perceive gestures, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like body image. Not everyone will react the same way to the same representation. What one person finds cute or realistic, another might see as a negative reinforcement of their insecurities.\n\nAlso, the coworkers are criticizing the author, suggesting that there's a social expectation in the workplace to avoid such representations. The author might not have realized that depicting someone's body type as is could be hurtful, even if it's done with good intentions. The fact that the coworker cried indicates a significant emotional reaction, which should be taken seriously.\n\nSo, considering the impact on the recipient and the workplace context, the author might be in the wrong for not anticipating how their coworker would feel. Even though the intention was good, the result was hurtful. It's possible that the author didn't consider the coworker's potential body image issues and assumed that representing her as she is would be neutral or positive. However, in such cases, it's better to err on the side of caution and avoid depicting body types that could be upsetting, especially when the person's comfort and feelings are at stake.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the action, while well-intentioned, caused emotional distress to the recipient. The key factor here is the harm caused, regardless of intent.\n"
