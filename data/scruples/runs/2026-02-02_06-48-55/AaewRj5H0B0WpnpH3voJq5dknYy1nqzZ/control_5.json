I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for drawing an overweight coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift. So the author made a drawing for a coworker they didn't know well. They knew the coworker was a cat person, so they drew a scene with her and her cat, shrinking it into an ornament. The coworker is overweight, and the author depicted her body type as such, similar to Steven Universe's body diversity. The coworker was upset and cried, feeling made to feel fat, and coworkers are calling the author an asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are body image and perception. The author thought their drawing was respectful and cute, but the recipient felt hurt. The author might not have realized that even if the intention was positive, the recipient could still feel targeted. Body image issues are sensitive, and even well-meaning depictions can be triggering. The author's coworkers are judgmental, but maybe the real issue is the sensitivity of the recipient. The author's question is whether they should have drawn her as thin even if she isn't. \n\nBut why is the author being blamed? The author didn't mean to hurt, but the act of depicting someone's actual body type in a gift might be seen as insensitive. However, it's also about personal boundaries. If the coworker wanted to feel comfortable, maybe the author should have considered that. On the other hand, the author had no prior knowledge of the coworker's sensitivity. It's a tricky situation. The answer likely depends on whether the drawing was respectful. If it was, then maybe not in the wrong. But since the recipient felt hurt, the author might have a responsibility to be more cautious. \n\nThe fact that the coworker cried suggests it was a significant emotional response. Even if the author didn't intend harm, the outcome was harmful. The author might need to apologize and explain their intention, but whether they're in the wrong is another question. Society often emphasizes being mindful of body image, so maybe the author is in the wrong for not anticipating how the recipient might feel. But it's also a case where people can have different sensitivities. The answer could be A (wrong) because the author depicted a physical aspect that caused distress, even unintentionally. Or B (not wrong) because the intention was good and it's about personal choice in art. \n\nI think the prevailing view would lean towards A because the recipient felt hurt, and the author should have considered that their depiction, regardless of intention, might be hurtful. Even if the coworkers are judgmental, the fact that the gift caused emotional harm means the author should have been more careful. So the answer is A.\n"
