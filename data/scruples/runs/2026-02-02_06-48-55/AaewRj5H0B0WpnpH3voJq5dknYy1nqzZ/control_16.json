I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who drew their coworker as overweight in a gift was in the wrong. The situation is about a secret Santa exchange where the author made an ornament with the coworker's likeness, including her body type. The coworker was upset and cried because it made her feel fat, and coworkers are calling the author an asshole. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are: the author intended to be kind, included the person's actual body type, which is overweight, and the coworker took offense. The author thought it was cute and respectful, like Steven Universe's style, which is known for diverse body representations.\n\nBut the coworker felt hurt. The issue here is about sensitivity and personal boundaries. Even if the author didn't mean any harm, the recipient's feelings matter. The author didn't consider that someone might be self-conscious about their weight and could feel hurt by a realistic representation. The coworkers are now blaming the author, which suggests that in their workplace culture, such a gesture is seen as inappropriate or hurtful.\n\nBody image is a sensitive topic. While the author might have believed they were being inclusive or realistic, it's important to recognize that not everyone is comfortable being portrayed as they are, especially in a public or shared setting like a workplace gift exchange. The author's action, though well-intentioned, might have crossed a line without considering the recipient's possible insecurities.\n\nThe question is whether the author should have altered the drawing to be thinner. The answer hinges on respecting the recipient's feelings and understanding that even a kind gesture can be misinterpreted. Since the coworker was upset and the workplace is now on the author's side, it's possible that the author's action was careless, even if unintentional. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the potential emotional impact despite their good intentions.\n"
