I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for drawing their coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the author made a drawing of their coworker, who is overweight, and they included her body type. The coworker was upset, even to the point of crying, and others are calling the author an asshole. The author is confused because they thought it was a nice, detailed gift and that representing her accurately was okay.\n\nNow, considering the key points here. The coworker's reaction is a clear indicator that the drawing made her feel bad about her weight. Even if the author intended it as a positive or neutral gesture, the effect was negative. The question is about whether the author was wrong, not just the intention. In such situations, the impact on the other person often matters more than the intention. \n\nAlso, societal norms and sensitivity play a role here. Body image is a sensitive topic, and even well-meaning actions can be hurtful. The author's coworkers are also saying they're an asshole, which adds peer pressure, but that's not the main issue. The main issue is whether the action was inappropriate.\n\nThe line \"nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type\" suggests the author tried to make it cute, but that doesn't necessarily negate the hurt felt. People have different triggers regarding their body image. The author might not have known the coworker's feelings about her weight, but in a professional setting, it's important to consider how gifts might be received, especially when they involve personal characteristics.\n\nMoreover, the Secret Santa exchange usually involves gifts that are lighthearted and not personal. Drawing someone's likeness with their body type might cross into personal territory, making it a risk. The coworker's reaction indicates that the gift was personal in a way that was uncomfortable for her.\n\nSo, while the author didn't have malicious intent, the action did cause harm. The responsibility lies in anticipating that such a representation could be hurtful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they failed to consider the potential negative impact of their gift.\n"
