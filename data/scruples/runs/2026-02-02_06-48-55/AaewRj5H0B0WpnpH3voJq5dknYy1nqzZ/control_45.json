I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who drew an overweight coworker as such in a Secret Santa ornament is in the wrong. The coworker was upset and cried because she felt made to look fat. The coworkers are now calling the author an asshole. The author is confused because they thought it was a nice, flattering drawing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker didn't know the author well, so maybe they didn't have a prior relationship where such a personal gift was appropriate. The author mentions using a Steven Universe body type, which is known for being diverse and inclusive. However, even if the intention was to be respectful, the recipient felt hurt. That's key here.\n\nIntentions matter, but so do the effects. Even if the author didn't mean to be unkind, the gift caused emotional distress. Body image issues are real, and for someone who is already self-conscious about their weight, being depicted in a way that highlights their size can be hurtful. The fact that the coworker went to the bathroom and cried shows a strong negative reaction.\n\nThe coworkers are telling the author they're wrong, which adds social pressure. It's important to consider cultural and social norms here. In many workplaces, there's a sensitivity around body image and personal appearance. Even if the drawing was meant as a compliment, it crossed a line for the recipient.\n\nThe author might not have considered that not everyone is comfortable having their body represented in art, especially in a public or shared setting like an ornament. The recipient's reaction should be respected. The author's hurt feelings about the time invested are valid, but they don't outweigh the recipient's emotional well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention might have been good, the outcome was harmful. The author should have considered the potential impact of representing the coworker's body type, especially in a personal gift. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
