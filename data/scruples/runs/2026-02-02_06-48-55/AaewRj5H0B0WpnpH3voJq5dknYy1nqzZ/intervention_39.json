I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a Secret Santa gift where someone drew a portrait of their coworker, who is overweight, and depicted her as such. The coworker was upset, cried, and others are calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author didn't mean to be mean; they thought it was a nice, cute gift. They mentioned using a style similar to Steven Universe, which is known for diverse body types and being positive. But the recipient had a negative reaction. That's the key point here. Intent is important, but the impact matters too. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt, the recipient felt hurt. \n\nNow, body image issues are really sensitive. Even if someone is portrayed in a generally positive or neutral way, if it brings attention to weight, it can trigger negative feelings, especially if the person is self-conscious. The author might not have realized how their coworker would react. But since they put a lot of effort into the gift, they were surprised by the reaction. However, the question is whether they were wrong.\n\nThe coworkers are saying the author is an asshole. That adds social pressure, but I need to think beyond that. Was it wrong to depict someone's actual body type? If the person is overweight and the depiction is respectful, maybe it's not inherently wrong. But in a workplace, there's a need for sensitivity. The author might not know their coworker well, so maybe they shouldn't have taken a risk on a body type depiction. \n\nAnother angle: the author could have chosen a more neutral or abstract style, or asked the coworker about preferences. But they didn't, thinking it was a nice gesture. However, in a professional setting, even a gift is a form of interaction that can affect someone's feelings. The key is whether the author should have known better, even if they didn't have bad intentions. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the depiction was unflattering. The author says it's not super unflattering, more like Steven Universe's style. But even so, if the recipient felt hurt, the author might be in the wrong because they should consider how their actions affect others. Even if it's not malicious, the harm is real. So the answer would lean towards AITA because they didn't account for the recipient's feelings about their body image.\n"
