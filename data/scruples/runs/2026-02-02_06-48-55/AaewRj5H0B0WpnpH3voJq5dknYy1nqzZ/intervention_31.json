I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who drew an overweight coworker as overweight in a gift is in the wrong. So the situation is that the coworker was upset because it made her feel fat, and others are calling the artist an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The artist thought it was cute and based on their knowledge that the coworker likes cats. They mention a Steven Universe body type, which is more about diversity in body representation. Maybe they intended to be respectful. But the coworker was hurt and cried, so the action had a negative impact.\n\nThe key here is intent versus impact. The artist's intent was to create a personalized gift, but the result caused emotional distress. Even if the artist didn't mean to be offensive, the effect is what matters in such situations. People can have different sensitivities, especially regarding body image. Drawing someone's actual appearance might be seen as respectful in some contexts, but in others, it could be hurtful if the person is self-conscious about it.\n\nAlso, the coworkers' reactions matter. They told the artist they were an asshole, which suggests a workplace culture where body image is a sensitive topic. The artist might not have realized the potential for harm, but in a professional setting, it's important to consider how colleagues might feel. Gifts are supposed to be positive, so if it caused someone to feel bad, it's a problem regardless of intention.\n\nAnother angle: the artist could have chosen to draw the person in a way that's flattering without focusing on their body size. Maybe they could have used a more cartoonish style to avoid emphasizing weight. But they did use the actual body type, which the recipient found unflattering. \n\nIn terms of social norms, there's a growing awareness about body positivity and avoiding comments on appearance that can lead to insecurity. Even if the artist meant well, the act of highlighting someone's weight in a drawing can be problematic, especially in a workplace where such interactions need to be respectful.\n\nSo, balancing intent and impact, the artist probably should have been more cautious. They might not have intended harm, but the result was hurtful. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because they caused emotional harm, even if unintentionally. However, there's a nuance here. If the body type was portrayed in a positive, respectful way (like in Steven Universe), maybe it's different, but the recipient still felt bad. It's possible that the artist didn't consider the recipient's personal feelings about their body image, which is a valid reason for being upset.\n\nIn conclusion, while the artist had good intentions, the outcome was negative, and they should have considered the potential for the drawing to be hurtful. So the answer is A.\n"
