I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who drew an overweight coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The situation is a bit nuanced.\n\nFirst, the person made an ornament of their coworker holding a cat. They mentioned the coworker is \"rather large\" and they depicted her body type as such, comparing it to Steven Universe's style, which is usually more stylized and less realistic. They thought it was cute and put a lot of time into it. However, the coworker was upset, even to the point of crying, and others are calling the author an asshole.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact. The author didn't have malicious intent; they wanted to give a personalized gift and thought it was a nice touch to represent her accurately. But the recipient was hurt. The issue is whether body type representation is a sensitive topic that even well-intentioned depictions can harm, even if they're not unflattering.\n\nBody image issues are real and can be affected by how others perceive and portray someone's body. Even if the drawing wasn't meant to be unkind, the act of highlighting someone's weight in a personal gift might feel like a public acknowledgment of their body type, which can be triggering. The coworkers' reactions suggest that in their workplace culture, this is seen as offensive. The author might not have considered the emotional impact, even if unintended.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't mock or exaggerate; they aimed for a respectful, stylized representation. They might think their intent was good. However, in situations like this, where someone is visibly upset, it's important to consider that the recipient's feelings are valid even if the intent was benign.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? It's possible they are not intentionally harmful, but they might have overlooked the sensitivity around body image. The answer hinges on whether actions, regardless of intent, lead to harm. Since the coworker was deeply hurt, even without malice, the author might be in the wrong for not anticipating that their gesture could be harmful. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes), but there's also a case for B (No) if the intent was purely good. However, given the context and the outcome, the consensus leaning towards A is likely.\n"
