I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who drew their coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. They provided the scenario where the coworker was upset and cried because the drawing made her feel fat, and now others are calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't know the recipient well but thought the gift was a nice, personal touch. They mentioned the drawing was done in a \"Steven Universe\" style, which might imply a cartoonish, non-offensive approach. However, the recipient was uncomfortable, which matters a lot.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. The author thought it was cute and meant it as a compliment, but the recipient took it as offensive. Even if the intention was good, the impact on the recipient is still important. Body image issues are sensitive, and making someone feel self-conscious can be hurtful, regardless of the artist's intent.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author put time into the gift and is now hurt themselves shows they care about the recipient's feelings. But the question is whether they were wrong. The main issue is that they included a feature of the person's body type without knowing how they would react. Even if the drawing wasn't unflattering, it's possible that the recipient is sensitive about their weight, which the author couldn't know beforehand.\n\nIn professional settings, especially with coworkers, it's generally safer to avoid any potentially sensitive topics unless you're certain they're acceptable. Personal gifts should ideally be positive and not include elements that could be misinterpreted. The coworkers' reaction that the author is an \"asshole\" suggests that the office culture found the act offensive, which might indicate that the author overstepped.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author didn't make fun of the person or add any negative elements\u2014just represented their body type as it is. If the drawing was respectful and the recipient is still upset, it's a tricky situation. The author might not be in the wrong if the intent was neutral and the drawing wasn't derogatory. But since the recipient felt hurt, the author should still consider apologizing and understanding the recipient's feelings, even if they didn't mean to harm.\n\nIn summary, while the intention might have been good, the sensitivity of the subject and the recipient's reaction mean that the author might be in the wrong for not considering how the depiction could affect the recipient. So the answer might lean towards A, but there's a case for B as well. However, since the recipient was clearly upset and the coworkers are critical, it's more likely that the author is in the wrong, hence A.\n"
