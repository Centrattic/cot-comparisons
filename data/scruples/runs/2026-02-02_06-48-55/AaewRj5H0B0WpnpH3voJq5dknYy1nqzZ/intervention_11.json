I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a secret Santa gift where they drew a coworker as overweight in an ornament. The coworker was upset and cried, feeling hurt that the drawing made her feel fat. The coworkers are calling the author an asshole for it.\n\nThe author's defense is that they drew the body type in a \"Steven Universe\" style, which is generally more accepting and diverse in body representation. They thought it was cute and put time into it. They're confused because they didn't mean to hurt her, but now they're being criticized.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent versus the impact. The author's intent was to create a personalized gift based on the coworker's interests (cats and being a big cat person). They didn't intend to be unflattering, but the coworker took offense. The key here is whether representing someone's actual body type in a drawing is inherently problematic, even if done with good intentions.\n\nBody image issues are significant for many people. Even if the artist thinks they're being respectful, the recipient might perceive it as a trigger. The coworker's emotional reaction (crying) suggests that the drawing had a negative impact, regardless of the artist's intent. The fact that the coworkers are also calling the author an asshole adds social pressure, indicating that the workplace culture might view this as inappropriate.\n\nHowever, there's a counterargument that the artist shouldn't be forced to misrepresent someone. Drawing someone as a different body type than they are could be seen as dishonest. But in this case, the artist did represent the actual body type, so the issue is whether that's acceptable in a gift context.\n\nIn terms of social norms, there's a tendency to avoid body-shaming, but also a debate around the right to draw people as they are. If the drawing was respectful and not mocking, maybe it's okay. But if the recipient feels hurt, the artist might need to consider that even well-intentioned actions can have unintended consequences.\n\nThe answer hinges on empathy and sensitivity. The artist might not be in the wrong if they had no malicious intent, but they could be seen as not considering the coworker's feelings enough. However, given that the coworker was genuinely upset, the artist might be at fault for not anticipating that sensitivity. So, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because they hurt someone's feelings despite good intentions, but there's also a case for B (not in the wrong) because they didn't intend harm. But in AITA scenarios, impact often outweighs intent, so leaning towards A.\n"
