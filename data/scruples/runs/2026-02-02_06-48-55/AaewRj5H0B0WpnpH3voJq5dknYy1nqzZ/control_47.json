I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who drew an overweight coworker as overweight in a secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The question is whether they are at fault (AITA).\n\nFirst, the context: the person drew their coworker, who is overweight, and the coworker was upset, crying because she felt it made her feel fat. The coworkers are calling the gift-giver an asshole. The author is confused because they thought the drawing was cute and respectful, similar to a Steven Universe style, which is known for diverse body representations.\n\nSo, the key points here are intentions versus the recipient's feelings. The author intended it as a kind gesture and thought the body type was accurately represented in a positive way. However, the recipient interpreted it negatively, feeling self-conscious about her weight. \n\nNow, considering social norms and workplace dynamics, even if the intention was good, the recipient's emotional response is valid. People can have different sensitivities, especially regarding body image. The fact that the coworker cried shows the impact of the gift, regardless of the creator's intent. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. In situations like this, it's often about how the action affected the other person, not just the intent. Even if the drawing was respectful, the recipient's distress matters. The author might argue that they didn't mean to offend and that the representation was positive, but the result was harmful. \n\nWorkplace relationships require empathy. Maybe the author didn't consider that the coworker might be self-conscious about her weight. It's possible that even a well-meaning gesture can be misinterpreted. The coworkers' judgment of the author as an \"asshole\" suggests that in their workplace culture, such a gift was seen as inappropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author put effort into the gift, tailored it to the coworker's interests (cats), and didn't exaggerate the features. Steven Universe's style is inclusive, so the author might have thought it was a good approach. However, the coworker's reaction is the main issue here. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might not be entirely at fault, but they did overlook the recipient's potential insecurities. The answer could lean towards the author being in the wrong because they caused emotional harm, even unintentionally. However, some might argue that the coworker's reaction is overly sensitive. \n\nBut considering that the recipient was deeply upset and the author's coworker's reaction, it's more likely that the author should have been more cautious. The right approach might have been to avoid body representation unless they were certain it wouldn't be an issue. So, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because actions should consider the feelings of others, even if unintended.\n"
