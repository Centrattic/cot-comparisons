I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who drew an overweight coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The coworker was upset, cried, and others are calling the drawer an asshole. The author is confused because they thought it was cute and tried to represent the person's actual body type.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. The gift was a drawing of the coworker holding a cat, intended as a secret Santa gift. The coworker is described as \"rather large,\" and the drawer depicted her body type similarly to Steven Universe characters, which are known for diverse body representations. The drawer thought it was a nice gesture but the recipient felt fat-shamed.\n\nSo, the question is whether depicting someone's actual body type in a gift is offensive. Weight is a sensitive topic. Even if done with good intentions, the recipient's feelings are valid. The key here is that the recipient felt hurt and upset. The drawer might have thought it was neutral or even positive, like in a cartoon where characters have different body types, but in reality, the recipient took it as a negative comment.\n\nAlso, in a workplace setting, it's important to consider how personal and potentially sensitive topics might be received. The drawer might not have considered the emotional impact or the potential for the drawing to be perceived as mocking, even if that wasn't the intention. The coworkers are now taking the drawer's side, but the recipient's reaction shows that the gift was hurtful.\n\nAnother angle: the drawer could have chosen to represent the coworker in a way that doesn't emphasize their body type, especially since they don't know the person well. Not everyone is comfortable with their body being depicted in art, especially if it highlights aspects they might be self-conscious about. The fact that the recipient cried indicates a significant emotional impact, which suggests that the drawer's action crossed a line unintentionally.\n\nIn terms of AITA situations, the general principle is that if someone's action makes another person feel bad, especially in a personal or sensitive way, the person who caused the hurt is usually at fault, even if they didn't mean to. The intention matters, but the impact is what's key here. The drawer's intention was to be kind and thoughtful, but the result was harmful. So, the answer might be AITA, but that could depend on cultural context or individual perspectives.\n\nHowever, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no. Considering the recipient's reaction and the sensitivity around body image, even if the drawer didn't intend to, the act of depicting someone's actual body type in a gift they received could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the recipient's feelings and body image issues.\n"
