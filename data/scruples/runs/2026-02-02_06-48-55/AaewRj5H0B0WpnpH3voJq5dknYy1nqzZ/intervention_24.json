I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for drawing an overweight coworker as she is in a gift.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person made a Secret Santa gift, an ornament with a drawing of their coworker (a big cat person) holding a cat. They drew her body type as she is\u2014overweight\u2014using a style similar to Steven Universe, which is described as not unflattering. However, the recipient was upset, even crying, because it made her feel fat. Now, the author is being criticized by coworkers for being an asshole, but they feel hurt because they put time into the gift and thought it was nice. They ask if they should have drawn her as thin even if she isn't.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. The answer should be A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nSo, what are the key factors here? The main issue is whether depicting someone's actual body type in a gift, even with good intentions, could be considered offensive or hurtful. The recipient's emotional response is significant\u2014she cried. The coworker's hurt feelings and the author's intention are both important here.\n\nIntentions vs. Impact: The author's intention was to create a personalized, thoughtful gift by representing the coworker accurately. However, the impact was negative. Even if the drawing wasn't unflattering, the fact that it made the coworker feel fat suggests that the depiction was hurtful. \n\nSensitivity and Awareness: The author might not have considered that body image is a sensitive topic for many people. Even if their intention was positive, not everyone may feel comfortable being depicted as they are, especially if they have insecurities about their body. The author's lack of awareness here could be the problem.\n\nContext and Relationship: The author mentions they don't know the coworker very well. This lack of closeness might mean that there's less understanding of the coworker's personal feelings about her body image. In a close relationship, there might be more understanding and trust, but in a more casual coworker setting, it's riskier to make such a personal choice.\n\nSocial Norms and Expectations: Gifts are supposed to be received positively. The coworker's negative reaction and the subsequent criticism from others indicate that the action didn't meet social expectations. Even if the author thought it was cute, others might see it as crossing a line.\n\nPotential Defenses: The author might argue that they were just being honest and that it's not their fault the coworker is sensitive. However, the act of choosing to depict someone's body type, especially in a personal gift, requires consideration of their feelings. The author's defense hinges on intent, but the outcome negates that.\n\nIn conclusion, even with good intentions, the author failed to consider the coworker's feelings and the potential hurt their depiction might cause. The key factor here is that the recipient was deeply affected, and the author's action, while well-meaning, resulted in harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
