I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who drew an overweight coworker in their gift is in the wrong. So the situation is that they did a Secret Santa exchange, and the person drew their coworkee as overweight in a drawing. The coworkee was upset and cried because it made her feel fat. Now the coworkers are calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't know their coworkee well but knew she liked cats. They drew her holding a cat as an ornament, making her body type accurate. They mention it was similar to Steven Universe's style, which is known for diverse body representations. The author thought it was cute and put time into it. However, the recipient was upset, leading to the question of fault.\n\nBody image is a sensitive topic. Even if the author didn't intend to be unflattering, the recipient felt hurt. The key here is intent versus impact. The author might have thought they were being kind and honest, but the impact was negative. It's possible that even if the drawing was accurate, it triggered insecurities in the recipient. \n\nNow, considering that the author didn't know the coworkee well, maybe they didn't realize how the recipient would feel. However, drawing someone's actual body type, especially when it's a sensitive topic, requires some level of consideration. Maybe the author should have chosen a more stylized or abstract representation to avoid focusing on body type.\n\nAlso, the coworkers are judging the author. That might indicate a workplace culture where such gestures are not appreciated. The author might not have considered that the recipient could have body image issues, which is a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they were being truthful and respectful. But in social interactions, especially in the workplace, it's important to be mindful of how others might perceive things. The fact that the recipient was upset suggests that the drawing crossed a line, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author should have anticipated the negative reaction. Since the author didn't know the coworkee well, maybe they had no way of knowing. But generally, drawing someone's body type accurately when it's a sensitive subject can be problematic. The author's responsibility is to be considerate, and in this case, they might have overlooked that. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not considering the recipient's feelings, even if it wasn't malicious.\n"
