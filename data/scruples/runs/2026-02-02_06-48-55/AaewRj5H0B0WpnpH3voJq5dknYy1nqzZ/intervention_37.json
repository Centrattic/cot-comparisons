I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for drawing an overweight coworker as her actual size in a Secret Santa gift. The author thought it was a cute gesture, considering the coworker's love for cats, and used a style similar to Steven Universe. But the coworker was upset, cried, and felt hurt, leading others to call the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker doesn't know the author very well, which means the author might not be fully aware of her feelings about her body image. Even if the drawing was meant to be flattering, the coworker perceived it as making her feel fat. Intentions matter, but so does the impact. The coworker's emotional response is significant here\u2014crying is a strong reaction. \n\nThe author put a lot of time into the gift, but that doesn't excuse the hurt caused. It's possible the author overlooked the sensitivity around body image without realizing it. The coworkers are now critical, which adds social pressure. The key issue here is whether the author should have considered the potential for the drawing to be hurtful, regardless of the original intention.\n\nBody image is a sensitive topic. Even if the author thought the style was flattering (like Steven Universe), the coworker's perspective is valid. The author might have assumed that being true to the coworker's appearance was respectful, but it's possible that the coworker feels self-conscious about her weight and finds such representations uncomfortable. \n\nIn such situations, it's often advised to err on the side of caution, especially when the person's comfort is at stake. The author might not have intended harm, but the act of drawing someone in a way that highlights their weight could be seen as perpetuating negative stereotypes or focusing on an aspect they might not want emphasized. \n\nTherefore, even if the intention was good, the result was hurtful. The author should have considered that their coworker might not appreciate being drawn as her actual size, especially without prior knowledge of her feelings about it. The answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because they failed to consider the coworker's potential discomfort, leading to harm despite good intentions.\n"
