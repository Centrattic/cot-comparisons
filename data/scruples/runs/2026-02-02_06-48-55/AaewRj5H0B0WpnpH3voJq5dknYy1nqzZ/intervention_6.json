I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who drew an overweight coworker as they are in a gift is at fault. The situation is about a secret Santa exchange where the gift was a drawing of the coworker holding a cat, with her body type represented as she is. The coworker was upset and cried, feeling it made her feel fat, and coworkers now think the author is an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't know their giftee well but tried to personalize the gift by incorporating her love for cats. They took care to draw her in a Steven Universe-style, which is known for diverse body types. The author thought it was cute and put time into it. However, the recipient was hurt, which is important.\n\nThe key question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they tried to be thoughtful and accurate in representing the recipient. On the other hand, the recipient felt hurt, so maybe the author didn't consider how their representation might be received. \n\nBody image issues are real and sensitive. Even if the intention was neutral or positive, the effect was negative. The author might not have realized that depicting someone's actual body type, even with good intentions, could be triggering for someone with self-esteem issues or body image concerns. \n\nThe author's defense is that they thought it was cute and that they didn't make it unflattering. However, the recipient's reaction is valid. The author should have considered that not everyone might feel comfortable with their body being depicted, even if accurately. It's possible that the author overlooked the possibility that the recipient might be self-conscious about their weight, which is a personal and emotional issue.\n\nIn terms of social norms, there's a growing awareness about body positivity, but also about respecting others' feelings regarding their body image. While body positivity advocates for acceptance, it doesn't mean that every depiction is welcome; it's about respect and consent. The author didn't get consent to depict the body type, and it caused harm. \n\nThe coworkers' reaction (calling the author an asshole) might stem from a place of defending the recipient's feelings. The author's hurt feelings about the gift not being appreciated are understandable, but the recipient's emotional response is more critical here. \n\nSo, balancing intention vs. impact: the author's intention was good, but the impact was negative. In such cases, the responsibility is often on the person whose action caused harm. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not anticipating the recipient's sensitivity to their body depiction, despite their good intentions.\n"
