I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe person drew a Secret Santa gift for a coworker. They knew the coworker likes cats, so they drew her holding a cat. Since the coworker is overweight, they depicted her as such, similar to Steven Universe's body diversity. They thought it was cute and put time into it. However, the coworker was upset and cried, feeling that it made her feel fat. The coworkers are now calling the author an asshole. The author is hurt because they put effort into the gift and thought it was nice.\n\nFirst, I should consider intent vs. impact. The author's intention was to represent the coworker accurately, including her body type. They mention it's not unflattering, like Steven Universe's style, which emphasizes diverse body types. However, the impact was negative; the coworker felt hurt and cried. \n\nBody image is a sensitive issue. Even if the intent was positive, the recipient's feelings are valid. The coworker might have a self-esteem issue or body dysmorphia, making the depiction hurtful. The author might not have considered that the coworker is self-conscious about her weight, even if others don't see it as a problem.\n\nThe author put effort into the gift, which is commendable, but the key here is whether they should have known not to depict the coworker's body type. They didn't know her well, which might mean they couldn't be entirely sure of her feelings. However, in a workplace, it's important to consider that certain depictions could be offensive, regardless of intent.\n\nThe coworkers are saying the author is an asshole, suggesting that the act of drawing the coworker as overweight was inappropriate. Even if the author didn't mean to be unkind, the act of highlighting someone's body type in a gift can be seen as pointing out a potentially sensitive aspect of their identity. \n\nIn artistic representation, body diversity is positive when it's meant to be inclusive, but in a personal gift to someone you don't know well, it's possible that the recipient might take it the wrong way. The author might not have realized that the coworker's weight is a sensitive topic for her. \n\nSo, even if the intention was to be accurate and respectful, the outcome was hurtful. The question is whether the author should have avoided depicting the body type to prevent causing distress. The answer could depend on cultural context, workplace norms, and personal sensitivities. In this case, the coworker's reaction indicates that the author was in the wrong because the action caused emotional harm, even if unintended.\n"
