I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for drawing their coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift.\n\nFirst, the context: the coworker is described as \"rather large,\" and the author drew her body type as such, but in a \"cute\" way, similar to Steven Universe. The coworker took it as an insult, felt hurt, and cried. Now the author is confused because they thought it was a nice gift and put effort into it.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are intent vs. impact. The author believed they were being kind, using a style that's supposed to be cute and not unflattering. However, the recipient felt insulted. \n\nBody image is a sensitive topic. Even if the intention was good, the recipient's reaction is valid. The author might not have considered how the recipient perceives their own body. What seems \"cute\" to one person might be hurtful to another, especially if the person is already self-conscious about their weight. \n\nAlso, the coworkers are now calling the author an asshole, which adds social pressure. The author might be surprised because they didn't mean harm. But the action still affected someone negatively. \n\nIs it the author's fault? They didn't mean to hurt, but they should have considered the possibility that representing someone's body type, even if accurately, might be hurtful. Maybe they should have asked the recipient's preference or chosen a different approach to avoid triggering negative feelings. \n\nIn situations like this, it's about empathy. The author's intent was positive, but the impact was negative. The question is whether the author is responsible for that impact. Since they didn't consider the potential for harm, maybe they are in the wrong. However, it's a gray area because they had no malicious intent. \n\nBut in terms of social responsibility, people should be cautious about how their actions affect others. The author could have been more mindful. So I think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because even with good intentions, the result was hurtful, and they should have anticipated that. But it's a nuanced case where the author isn't a villain, but did act inconsiderately.\n"
