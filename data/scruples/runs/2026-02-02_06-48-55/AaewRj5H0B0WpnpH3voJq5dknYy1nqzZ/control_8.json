I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who drew an overweight coworker as such in a Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The question is whether they should have drawn her as thin instead. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person drew their coworker, who is overweight, in a cartoon style, similar to Steven Universe's body types. They mention it wasn't unflattering, just represented her body type. The coworker was upset and cried because it made her feel fat. Now, coworkers are calling the author an asshole, and they're hurt because they put time into the gift.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about body image, respect, and intentions. The author's intention was to create a personalized, cute gift based on the coworker's interests (cats). However, the coworker took offense. Even if the author didn't intend to be unflattering, the result hurt her feelings. \n\nI should consider the impact versus the intention. Even if the author meant well, the coworker felt hurt. Maybe the author didn't realize that representing someone's body, even accurately, can be triggering for some people. It's possible that the coworker has body image issues and was sensitive about it. The author might not be in the wrong for not knowing, but in a workplace setting, it's important to consider others' feelings and avoid anything that could be perceived negatively, especially when it comes to sensitive topics like body size.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't exaggerate or mock, just represented her as she is. The coworker's reaction is understandable, but the author's intention was positive. However, in a professional context, giving a gift that leads to someone feeling upset might be seen as not considering their feelings, even unintentionally. \n\nSo, there's a balance here. The author might be in the wrong for not anticipating how the coworker might feel, even if they didn't mean to be offensive. Alternatively, since the coworker didn't ask for a specific representation, the author might not be in the wrong. But the coworkers' judgment is that they are an asshole, which complicates things. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because even if the intention was good, the result hurt someone's feelings. In a workplace, being mindful of others' feelings is important, and maybe the author should have chosen a different approach, like avoiding the body type representation or being more subtle. But I'm a bit conflicted because the author didn't have malicious intent. However, the impact is what matters here.\n"
