I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who asked \"Am I the Asshole\" is in the wrong. The situation is about a Secret Santa gift where they drew an overweight coworker as her actual size in a drawing, which upset her. The coworkers are calling them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person drew their coworkee as she is, which they thought was respectful and cute. They mention it was similar to Steven Universe's body types, which are often praised for diversity. But the recipient was upset and felt it made her feel fat. The coworkers are on her side, saying the author is wrong.\n\nNow, the key points here are intent versus impact. The author's intention was to be truthful and create a personal gift. However, the impact was negative. The recipient's reaction is valid because she felt hurt. The question is whether the author should have altered the drawing to make her thinner, even if that's not accurate.\n\nIn many situations, people can have different sensitivities. Body image issues are real, and even if the artist didn't mean to offend, the result was hurtful. The coworkers' reaction suggests that in their office culture, depicting someone's actual body type is considered unkind, regardless of the artist's intent.\n\nAdditionally, Secret Santa is supposed to be a fun, positive exchange. If the gift caused emotional distress, even unintentionally, it might be seen as a misstep. The author could have considered the recipient's possible feelings and maybe asked if it's okay to include her likeness, or chosen a different approach to avoid body-related depictions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did put effort into personalizing the gift, which is a good thing. They didn't exaggerate or mock, just represented her as she is. However, the problem lies in the recipient's perception and the office's reaction. Even if the drawing was respectful, the act of highlighting body size can be sensitive, especially in a professional setting where people might not be close.\n\nSo, balancing intent and impact, while also considering the recipient's feelings and the coworkers' judgment, it's possible the author is in the wrong. They could have been more considerate of how body representation might affect someone, especially if they don't know the person well. The answer might lean towards A, but I need to check if the context of the drawing being a respectful, accurate representation without malice affects the outcome.\n"
