I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who drew an overweight coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa ornament is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person didn't know their giftee well but drew her, a cat person, holding a cat. They included her body type as she is, thinking it was cute, similar to Steven Universe's style. The coworker was upset and cried, feeling made to feel fat. Now, the author is confused because they put effort into the gift and thought it was nice. The coworkers are calling them an asshole, and the question is whether they're at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are intent versus impact. The author didn't mean to hurt their coworker but did include a physical trait that the coworker found hurtful. The coworkers are saying they're in the wrong. The user already thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nI need to consider body image issues. For many people, especially those with weight concerns, being depicted in a way that highlights their size can be triggering. Even if the artist intended it as a positive or neutral representation, the recipient's emotional response is valid. The author might not have considered the sensitivity around body image, especially since they don't know the coworker well. \n\nAlso, the context of a workplace environment matters. Gifts should ideally be inclusive and considerate, avoiding any potential for personal features that could be misinterpreted. Even if the artist thought it was a compliment, the result was negative. The coworker felt embarrassed and upset, which is a significant reaction. \n\nThe author's defense is that the drawing was accurate and they put effort into it. However, the mistake here is not in the depiction's accuracy but in not anticipating how the recipient might feel. The fact that the coworkers are criticizing the author suggests that there's an expectation in the workplace to avoid such depictions, regardless of intent. \n\nIn situations like this, it's important to acknowledge the recipient's feelings and apologize. The author should probably take responsibility, even if they didn't mean harm. They might not be malicious, but the action did cause harm. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they failed to consider the emotional impact of their gift, even with good intentions.\n"
