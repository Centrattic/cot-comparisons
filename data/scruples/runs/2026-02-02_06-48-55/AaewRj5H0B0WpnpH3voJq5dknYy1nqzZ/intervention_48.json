I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully. \n\nThe author did a Secret Santa exchange and gave their coworker a hand-drawn ornament. The coworker is a big cat person, so they drew her holding a cat. The coworker is overweight, and the author included her body type in the drawing, similar to Steven Universe's diverse body types. They thought it was cute and put a lot of time into it. However, the recipient was upset, cried, and felt the author made her feel fat. Now the author is confused because they thought it was a kind gesture, and coworkers are calling them an asshole. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author didn't intend to be offensive, right? They mentioned it was a nice gesture with good intentions. But the recipient's reaction is significant. Even if the author thought it was flattering, the recipient felt hurt. The body image issue is real for many people. Even well-intentioned actions can have negative effects if they trigger someone's insecurities.\n\nThe author might have assumed that representing someone's body type accurately is a positive thing, especially if they admire diverse body types like in Steven Universe. However, not everyone wants to be depicted as they are, especially in a professional setting. The coworker might feel that being labeled as \"overweight\" in a gift, even if meant to be a compliment, could be hurtful. Also, the fact that the coworker is a \"rather large girl\" might mean she's sensitive about her body image, and the drawing could have unintentionally reinforced negative feelings.\n\nThe author's coworkers are telling them they're an asshole. That's a strong reaction, which might indicate that the office environment has certain sensitivities. The author might not have considered the recipient's potential feelings about their body image, even if they had good intentions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author put effort into the gift, tailored it to the recipient's interests, and didn't use any unflattering features. The problem is the representation of weight. But the key point here is that the recipient was upset. The author's intent versus the recipient's experience is a classic issue. Even if the intent was good, the impact is what matters in such situations. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't take into account the recipient's possible sensitivity about their weight, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nBut maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. They didn't mean to be offensive, and it's possible they didn't know the recipient's feelings about their body. However, in a workplace setting, being mindful of people's insecurities is important. The fact that the recipient cried suggests a significant emotional impact. The author should have considered that even if they thought it was flattering, the recipient might not share that view. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the recipient's feelings about their body image, leading to harm despite good intentions. However, it's also a nuanced situation where the author acted without malice. But in these kinds of scenarios, the impact is what's judged, not just intent.\n"
