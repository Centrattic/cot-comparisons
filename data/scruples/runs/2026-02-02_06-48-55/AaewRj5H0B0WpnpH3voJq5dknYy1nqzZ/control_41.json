I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for drawing an overweight coworker as she is in a gift. The situation involves a secret Santa exchange where the author drew an ornament of the coworker holding her cat, accurately representing her body type. The coworker was upset and cried because she felt it made her feel fat, and now coworkers are calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't know the coworker well but knew she was a cat person. They put a lot of time into the gift. The drawing was supposed to be a representation, not unflattering, similar to Steven Universe's body diversity. However, the coworker was hurt, which is a significant factor.\n\nBody image issues are real and sensitive. Even if the intention was to be respectful and accurate, the recipient's reaction is crucial. The author might have thought it was neutral or positive, but the coworker felt targeted. The coworkers are siding with her, which adds social pressure. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is wrong. Intention matters, but so does impact. The author didn't mean to harm, but the result was hurtful. There's a balance here between honesty and compassion. However, in a workplace setting, avoiding topics that might trigger someone is important for maintaining harmony. Even if it's a representation, some people might find it triggering regardless of the artist's intent.\n\nAlso, the context of a gift might imply a personal touch, and including someone's body type could cross a line. The author might not have considered that the coworker could be sensitive about her weight. Even if the drawing was flattering, the subjectivity of perception plays a role. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author didn't exaggerate or mock. They said it was a realistic representation. The question is whether it's acceptable to depict someone accurately in a gift if it makes them feel bad. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific relationship between the individuals. \n\nIn many cases, people have different comfort levels regarding how their bodies are portrayed. The fact that the coworker went to the bathroom and cried shows the emotional impact. The author's coworkers are also critical, which suggests that in their workplace culture, such a depiction is not acceptable. \n\nSo, considering all that, even with good intentions, the action caused harm. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the potential for the coworker's sensitivity to her body image, especially in a professional setting where such personal gifts can be tricky. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to make sure I'm not overlooking the intent vs. impact debate here.\n"
