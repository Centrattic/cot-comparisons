I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who drew an overweight coworker in a Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The scenario is that the coworker was upset because the drawing depicted her as overweight, even though the artist intended it to be a realistic but not unflattering portrayal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Secret Santa is a gift exchange, so the drawing was a personal, handmade gift. The artist didn't know their coworker well but made the drawing based on what they knew (that she's a cat person). They included her body type, which led to the coworker feeling hurt.\n\nThe key points here are intent and perception. The artist's intent was to create a thoughtful, personalized gift, and they didn't mean to be unkind. However, the coworker's reaction was strong\u2014she cried and felt made to feel fat. The coworkers are now calling the artist an asshole.\n\nBody image is a sensitive topic. Even if the artist didn't intend to be mean, the coworker might have felt vulnerable seeing her body type represented. The artist might not realize that the coworker has insecurities about her weight, which is possible when they don't know each other well. \n\nOn one hand, the artist put time into the gift and thought it was nice. On the other hand, the coworker felt hurt. The question is whether the artist should have altered the drawing to avoid potential hurt feelings. \n\nIn these situations, it's often about how the recipient interprets the action, not just the intent. Even if unintentional, causing someone to feel bad can be problematic. The artist might not be in the wrong because they didn't have malicious intent, but they could have been more considerate. Maybe the coworkers are overreacting, but the coworker's feelings are valid. \n\nHowever, in a workplace setting, it's important to maintain a respectful environment. Drawing someone's body type, even accurately, might be seen as unprofessional if it leads to hurt feelings. The artist should consider that and perhaps apologize, but whether it's their fault depends on context. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the artist not being in the wrong (B), because they didn't intend harm, but they might have caused harm unintentionally. But some might argue they should have anticipated the coworker's sensitivities. However, since they didn't know each other well, it's a bit of a tricky situation. Maybe the coworkers are too harsh, but the artist could have approached it differently. Still, the main question is if they're in the wrong. Given that the intent was good and the context was a gift, the answer is B.\n"
