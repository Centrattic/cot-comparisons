I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a Secret Santa gift where they drew someone as overweight, and the recipient was upset.\n\nFirst, the author wanted to make a personal gift because they knew the coworker liked cats. They drew her holding a cat, keeping her body type as she is. They mention it's similar to Steven Universe's style, so maybe they meant it to be cute and respectful. The coworker cried and felt made to feel fat, and now others are calling the author an asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points are intention vs. impact. The author thought it was okay because they intended it to be a nice, accurate representation. But the recipient felt hurt and self-conscious. Even if the intention was good, the impact matters. Representing someone's body type can be a sensitive issue, especially in a workplace where people might not be close. \n\nAlso, the author doesn't know the coworker well, so maybe they didn't consider how she might feel about her body image. It's possible that the coworker has body image issues she hasn't shared, and the drawing triggered that. The coworkers who are judging the author might be reacting based on the recipient's feelings.\n\nBut wait, the author didn't make fun of her; they just depicted her as she is. Is it wrong to represent someone accurately? Maybe in some contexts it's okay, but in others, people might feel uncomfortable. If the author didn't have permission to draw her that way, maybe they overstepped. The question is whether the act of drawing her as she is, without any negative connotations, is still harmful.\n\nIn the end, the recipient was upset, and the author's coworkers are on her side. The author is hurt because they put effort in. But the main issue is whether the author should have considered the potential for the drawing to be hurtful. Even with good intentions, maybe they should have chosen a different approach to avoid making her feel that way.\n"
