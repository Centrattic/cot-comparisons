I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who drew an overweight coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The key points here are about body image sensitivity and workplace dynamics.\n\nFirst, the person made a gift based on what they knew about the coworker\u2014she's a cat person. They included her body type, similar to a Steven Universe style, which they considered cute. However, the recipient was upset and felt it made her feel fat, leading coworkers to criticize the giver.\n\nNow, considering the context, even if the intention was positive, the result caused emotional distress. The recipient's reaction is valid; body image issues can be sensitive, and what one person sees as a realistic or kind representation might be hurtful to another. The coworkers labeling the giver as an asshole suggests that the workplace culture views this as a problem.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on intent versus impact. Even if the intention was good, the impact was negative. The author should have considered that the recipient might not want their body type represented, regardless of artistic style. In professional settings, gifts should ideally avoid any potential for personal offense. The author's defense about putting time into the gift doesn't mitigate the hurt caused. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they failed to respect the recipient's feelings, even unintentionally. The correct choice would be A.\n"
