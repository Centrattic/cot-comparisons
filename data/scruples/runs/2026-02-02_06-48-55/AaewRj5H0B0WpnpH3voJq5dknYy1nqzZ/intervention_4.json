I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a Secret Santa gift where the person drew their coworker as overweight in an ornament. The coworker was upset and cried, feeling made fat, and others called the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider body image issues. The author drew the coworker's actual body type. Even if they thought it was cute, like Steven Universe style, the recipient felt hurt. That's a key point. The author might have thought it was a compliment, but the recipient's reaction shows it wasn't. The question is whether it's wrong to depict someone as they are, but in a gift context where sensitivity is important.\n\nAlso, the coworkers are part of the workplace. The author might not know the recipient well, so maybe they didn't realize how the coworker would feel. However, in a professional setting, even a friendly gesture like Secret Santa should consider the recipient's feelings. Depicting someone's body type, especially when it's a sensitive topic, could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe author put effort into the gift, but the intent doesn't negate the impact. The coworker's emotional response indicates that the gift caused hurt. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the result was negative. The question is whether the author should have been aware of potential sensitivities and chosen a different representation. \n\nIn some cases, people might feel that depicting someone's actual appearance is okay, but when it relates to body weight, it's a touchy subject. Many people struggle with body image, so even a well-intentioned drawing could inadvertently hurt. The author might have assumed it was a compliment, but the recipient's reaction shows it wasn't. The coworkers' judgment also adds that others see the author as at fault. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong because they didn't consider how the depiction might affect the recipient's self-esteem, even if unintended.\n"
