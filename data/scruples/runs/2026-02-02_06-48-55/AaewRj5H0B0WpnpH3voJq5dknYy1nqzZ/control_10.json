I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who drew an overweight coworker in a gift is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context is a Secret Santa exchange. The person drew their giftee, who is overweight, on shrinking paper. The drawing was supposed to be a cute ornament, and they mentioned the body type was similar to Steven Universe, which I know is a show that's praised for diverse representations. The coworkers are upset because the drawing depicted her as overweight, leading her to cry. The author is confused because they thought it was a nice, accurate representation and put time into it.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are intent vs. impact. The author's intention was to create a personalized and thoughtful gift, using the recipient's interests (cats) and acknowledging her body type in a way they found cute. However, the recipient's reaction was negative, feeling it made her feel fat. \n\nI need to consider the social norms and sensitivities around body image. Even if the intent was positive, the depiction of someone's weight in a gift can be problematic. Weight is a sensitive issue for many, and what one person sees as a compliment or a harmless representation, another might find offensive or hurtful. The author might not have considered that the recipient could feel self-conscious about her body, especially in a professional setting where people might be protective of their personal boundaries.\n\nAlso, coworkers are telling the author they're an asshole, which suggests that there's a social expectation in their workplace that such a depiction is inappropriate. Even if the author didn't mean harm, the act might still be seen as crossing a line by others. The fact that the gift was a personal drawing adds to the issue because it's a direct representation of the person, which can feel more intrusive or sensitive than a general comment.\n\nThe author's argument is that they were being honest and the drawing wasn't unflattering. But the problem here isn't just about honesty; it's about respecting others' feelings. The recipient's emotional reaction (crying) is a strong indicator that the gesture was hurtful, regardless of intent. In such cases, the impact on the person's feelings is more important than the original intention. \n\nMoreover, Secret Santa is supposed to be a lighthearted, positive event. If the gift causes distress, it's a failure to meet that expectation. The author might have thought they were being inclusive or kind, but they didn't account for the recipient's perspective and how the depiction could affect her self-esteem. \n\nSo, while the author's intent was good, the action's result was harmful. In situations where someone's feelings are hurt, even if unintentionally, the onus is usually on the person who caused the hurt to apologize and consider future actions. The author is in a workplace environment where such a gift could be perceived as unkind, and the coworkers' reaction supports that. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
