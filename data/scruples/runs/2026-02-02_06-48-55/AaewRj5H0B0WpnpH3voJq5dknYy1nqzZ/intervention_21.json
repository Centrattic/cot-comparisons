I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for drawing their coworker as overweight in a secret Santa gift. The author didn't know the coworker well but knew she liked cats. They made an ornament with her and her cat, keeping her body type accurate. The coworker was upset and cried because she felt the drawing made her feel fat, and coworkers now call the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions. The author thought it was a nice gesture and put time into it. They mention it was a realistic representation similar to Steven Universe's diverse body types. But the gift recipient took it as an insult. The key here is the effect versus the intention. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt, the result was hurtful. \n\nBody image issues are a sensitive topic. People can have different sensitivities. The coworker might have body image concerns and felt that being depicted as overweight in a gift, even if done with care, was a negative reflection. The coworkers' reaction suggests that in their workplace, such a depiction is seen as unkind or offensive. \n\nThe author might not have considered the recipient's personal feelings about their body. While they didn't intend to mock, the act of highlighting someone's weight, even realistically, can trigger negative emotions. It's possible the author didn't realize the weight was a sensitive topic for their colleague. \n\nIn these situations, empathy and awareness are crucial. Even with good intentions, not considering how the recipient might feel about their body can lead to unintended harm. The coworkers' judgment implies that in their context, the author overstepped by focusing on the recipient's appearance, regardless of the artist's view on body diversity. \n\nSo, even if the author had positive motives, the outcome was negative. The answer might hinge on whether the act of depicting someone's body type, even accurately, is considered offensive if it makes them feel bad. The fact that the coworker cried and the author's colleagues support her suggests that the author is in the wrong here. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
