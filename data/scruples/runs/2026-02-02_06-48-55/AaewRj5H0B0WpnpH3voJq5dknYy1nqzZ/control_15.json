I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a secret Santa gift where the person drew a portrait of their coworker, who is overweight, and included her body type. The coworker was upset, saying it made her feel fat, and others are calling the giver an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user intended it as a nice gesture, inspired by Steven Universe's body diversity, which is generally seen as positive. They put effort into the gift, which is a good point. But the recipient was hurt and cried. That's significant.\n\nThe main issue here is whether depicting someone's actual body type without their input is respectful. Even if the artist thought it was cute and intended no harm, the recipient felt bad. Body image is a sensitive topic. People have different comfort levels with how their bodies are portrayed. What one person sees as a celebration of diversity, another might see as highlighting their insecurities.\n\nI should think about intent vs. impact. The artist's intent was to be kind and inclusive, but the impact was negative. Even if the drawing wasn't unflattering, the act of highlighting someone's weight without their consent can be hurtful. It's possible the coworker might have felt self-conscious about her weight, and the portrait inadvertently reminded her of that. \n\nAlso, the artist didn't know the coworker well. Maybe they didn't realize how the recipient would perceive it. However, in a workplace setting, it's important to consider how personal gifts might affect others. Even with good intentions, the artist might have overstepped by including a personal trait that could be sensitive.\n\nIn cases like this, the recipient's feelings are valid. If someone is upset, the person who caused the hurt might be at fault, even if unintentionally. The key is whether the action respected the other person's boundaries and feelings. Since the coworker was hurt and the artist didn't consider that possibility, it's likely they are in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
