I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who made the ornament is in the wrong. The situation is about a Secret Santa gift where the author drew their coworker as overweight, even though they tried to make it \"cute\" like in Steven Universe. The coworker was upset and cried because it made her feel fat, and now the author is being criticized by coworkers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't know the recipient well but thought of their interests (cat person). The drawing was a realistic representation of the coworker's body type, which is a sensitive topic. The key points here are body image and intent vs. impact.\n\nThe author claims they didn't intend to hurt, but the coworker felt offended. Even if the intent was good, the impact was negative. The question is whether the author should have realized that depicting someone's actual body type in a gift could be hurtful. Body size is a sensitive issue, and while some people might appreciate realistic depictions, others might not. The author didn't ask for the coworker's preferences or consider how it might be received, especially since they didn't know her well. \n\nAlso, the coworker's reaction indicates that it was a real emotional impact. The author's coworkers are now calling them an asshole, so there's a social consequence too. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the act of drawing someone's actual body type without their input or consent can be seen as inappropriate, especially in a professional setting where relationships might not be close. \n\nSo, in this case, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't take into account the possibility of how the gift could be received. The intent was to be kind, but the action had a negative effect, and the author should have considered the sensitivity of the subject. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the impact on the coworker was significant, and the author could have made a different choice to avoid causing distress, even if unintentionally.\n"
