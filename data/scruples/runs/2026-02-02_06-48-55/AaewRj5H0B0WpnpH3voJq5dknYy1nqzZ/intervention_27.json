I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a secret Santa gift where they drew a portrait of their coworker, who is overweight, and included her body type. The coworker was upset and cried because she felt it made her feel fat, and now the author is being called an asshole by coworkers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author says they wanted to make a personal gift, using the coworker's love for cats. They mention drawing her body type to represent her accurately, similar to the Steven Universe style, which is known for diverse body types. They thought it was cute and a compliment.\n\nBut the recipient was hurt, which is a key point. Even if the intent was good, the impact matters. The coworker felt fat and was upset, leading to emotional distress. The author might not have realized the sensitivity around body image issues. It's possible that the coworker has a history of body image problems, which the author wasn't aware of.\n\nAlso, the coworkers are calling the author out, which adds social pressure. The question is whether the author should have drawn her as thin instead. The author's defense is that they wanted to be accurate, but maybe they should have considered that representing someone's body as they are might not always be appropriate in a gift setting, especially if the person is sensitive about it.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"body positivity.\" While the author might have intended to show the coworker as she is, in reality, body size can be a sensitive issue for many people, especially in workplaces where such topics might not be discussed openly. Even well-meaning gestures can backfire if the recipient has different feelings about their body image.\n\nThe author's hurt feelings are valid because they put effort into the gift. However, the main issue is whether their action was respectful and considerate. The coworker's reaction indicates that the drawing was harmful, regardless of intent. Respecting others' feelings often requires more than just good intentions; it involves empathy and awareness of potential sensitivities.\n\nSo, balancing intent and impact, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the coworker's feelings about their body image, leading to harm. The coworkers' criticism could be valid if they believe the drawing was unkind. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
