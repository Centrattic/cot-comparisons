I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they did something wrong by drawing their coworker as overweight for a secret Santa gift. They mentioned the coworker is a cat person, so they made a drawing of her with her cat and shrunk it into an ornament. The coworker got upset and cried because she felt it made her feel fat.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to be nice, using a style similar to Steven Universe, which is known for its diverse body types. They thought it was cute and put a lot of time into it. The problem is that the recipient took it as an insult. Now, the coworkers are calling the author an asshole, and the author is hurt because they thought their gift was well-meaning.\n\nBody image is a sensitive topic. Even if the artist's intent was positive, the recipient's reaction is valid. People have different sensitivities, and weight is a common insecurity. The author might not have realized how the drawing could affect the coworker. While the artist didn't have malicious intent, the fact that the gift caused emotional harm matters. The key here is that intentions don't always align with the impact. Even if the artist thought it was a compliment, the recipient's experience is what counts. So, even if the artist had good intentions, causing someone to feel bad about their body is problematic. The author might have been unaware of the coworker's feelings about her weight, but that doesn't excuse the outcome. It's important to consider others' perspectives, especially in a workplace setting where relationships can be affected. The answer might lean towards the author being at fault because the gift caused harm, regardless of the intent.\n"
