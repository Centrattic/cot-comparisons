I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question drew a Secret Santa gift for a coworker, an overweight girl. They depicted her as she is, using a style similar to Steven Universe, which is generally body-positive. The coworker was upset and even cried, feeling that the drawing made her feel fat. The author is confused because they thought it was cute and put effort into it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent versus the impact. The author intended to be kind and personal, but the recipient had a negative reaction. While the drawing wasn't unflattering, the act of highlighting someone's weight in a gift might be problematic. Even if done with good intentions, people have different sensitivities. The coworker might have body image issues that the author wasn't aware of. \n\nNext, the response from coworkers labeling the author an asshole suggests that they see the action as hurtful. It's possible that the author didn't consider how the recipient might perceive it, especially in a professional setting where such topics can be delicate. The key here is whether the author should have been more considerate of the recipient's feelings about their body image. \n\nEven if the drawing was respectful, some people might still find it triggering. The author should have considered that not everyone is comfortable having their weight represented, regardless of the artist's perception. The fact that the recipient was upset indicates that the author's approach had negative consequences. \n\nIn conclusion, while the intent was good, the outcome was harmful. The author should have anticipated that depicting someone's weight in a gift could be distressing. So, the answer leans towards A\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
