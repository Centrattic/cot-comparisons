Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who drew a picture of their overweight coworker as overweight for a Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They did a Secret Santa exchange, and the recipient is a \"rather large girl.\" The person drew her holding her cat, using \"shrinking paper\" to make an ornament. They mention the body type is similar to Steven Universe, which is a show known for including diverse body types. The person thought it was cute and put time into it, but the recipient was upset, even crying, saying it made her feel fat. Now coworkers are calling the author an asshole, and the author is confused because they didn't mean to hurt anyone and thought they were being nice.\n\nThe key points here are intent, perception, and the context of the relationship. The author didn't intend to be offensive and thought it was a good gesture. However, the recipient was hurt by it. Even if the author's intention was positive, the impact on the recipient matters. The coworkers are siding with the recipient, which adds pressure. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the recipient's feelings are valid. Body image is a sensitive issue, and even if the drawing was meant to be accurate and not unflattering, representing someone's body type in a personal gift can be triggering for someone who has issues with their weight. The fact that the recipient cried shows it had a negative effect. The author might not have considered how the recipient would feel about their body being highlighted in a gift from someone they don't know well. \n\nHowever, the author also put effort into personalizing the gift based on the coworker's love for cats. It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the author didn't have malicious intent. On the other, they may have overlooked the recipient's potential sensitivity. The coworkers judging the author might be influenced by their own views on body positivity, which is important, but the recipient's personal reaction is central here.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes even well-meaning actions can be misinterpreted, especially when it comes to body image. The question is whether the author should have known better. Since they don't know the coworker very well, they might not be aware of her feelings about her weight. But in a workplace setting, it's generally safer to avoid anything that could be seen as potentially offensive, even if unintentional.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author probably isn't in the wrong if their intention was positive and they didn't know the recipient would be hurt. However, the fact that the recipient was upset does mean the author might need to reflect on how to approach such gifts in the future. But strictly speaking, since there was no malice, the answer leans towards not being in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted. Maybe the answer is A because the impact is important, but the user's perspective is that the author tried to be nice. Hmm. Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the action was wrong regardless of intent. In many cases, especially in body image issues, the impact is considered more than intent. So even if the author didn't mean to, the act of drawing her as she is could be seen as wrong if it hurt her. Therefore, the answer might be A. But I need to check again. The author didn't make her fat, just represented her as she is. But that's the crux. So, in some contexts, it's about respecting the person's wishes. If the recipient felt uncomfortable, the author might be in the wrong even if unintentional. However, others might argue that it's not the author's fault. This is a classic AITA scenario. The answer could be A or B. But in many similar cases, the person is considered not in the wrong if the intent was good and there was no malice. So maybe B. But the fact that the recipient was upset might make it A. Hmm. I think the answer here is A. Because even if the intention was good, the action had a negative effect, and in the context of a gift intended to be personal, it's important to consider how the recipient might feel. So the author is in the wrong for not considering the recipient's feelings about their body.\n"
