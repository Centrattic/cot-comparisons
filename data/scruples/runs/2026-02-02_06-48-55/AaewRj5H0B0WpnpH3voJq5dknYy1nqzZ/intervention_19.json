I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they drew a Secret Santa gift for a coworker. They didn't know her well but knew she liked cats, so they drew her holding a cat on shrink paper and made an ornament. The coworker is overweight, and the author drew her body type to reflect that. They mention it's nothing super unflattering, more like a Steven Universe style. But the coworker was upset, cried, and now coworkers are saying the author is an asshole.\n\nHmm. The author thought it was cute and put time into it, but the recipient felt hurt. The key here is whether the author's action crossed a line into making someone feel bad about their body. Even if the author didn't intend to be unflattering, the recipient felt it made her feel fat. That's a big emotional reaction. \n\nNow, body image is a sensitive issue. Even if the drawing was accurate and not mean-spirited, representing someone's body in a way that's not typical might cause discomfort. The author might not have considered that the recipient could be self-conscious about her weight. Also, in a workplace, there's a need to be considerate of others' feelings, even if you didn't mean harm.\n\nBut then again, the author tried to be respectful by avoiding anything unflattering. They might have thought it was a positive gesture, showing her as she is. But the recipient interpreted it as negative. Intention vs. impact is a common ethical dilemma here. Even if the intent was good, the impact was harmful. \n\nIs it the author's fault? They didn't know the recipient well, so maybe they couldn't have known about her sensitivities. But on the other hand, the coworker's reaction shows that the drawing had a negative effect. The author might have been wrong to include the body type, even if it was accurate. Maybe they should have drawn her in a way that's universally flattering, regardless of her actual body type.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people often avoid depicting others in ways that might highlight aspects they're self-conscious about. Especially in a gift, which is supposed to be a positive gesture. If the recipient feels hurt, then the author might be in the wrong for not anticipating that. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong. Even if unintended, the action caused harm, and they should have considered the recipient's feelings more carefully.\n"
