I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who drew an overweight coworker as such in a gift is at fault. The situation is a secret Santa exchange where the person drew a picture of their coworkee, who is overweight, accurately representing her body type. The coworkers are upset, and the person is confused because they thought it was a nice, respectful gesture, similar to how characters in shows like Steven Universe are depicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider intent. The person's intention was to create a personalized, thoughtful gift. They didn't make fun of her weight; they represented her as she is. However, the recipient was hurt and even cried. That's a red flag. Even if the intention was good, the result caused emotional harm. \n\nThen there's the matter of body image. Being overweight can be a sensitive topic for many people. Even if the drawing wasn't meant to be unflattering, the recipient might have felt it highlighted her weight in a negative way. The author mentions it's similar to Steven Universe's body types, but maybe that comparison isn't helpful here. Steven Universe is a cartoon with exaggerated features, and viewers might not take that the same way as a personal portrait of a real person.\n\nAlso, the context of coworkers is important. They don't know each other very well, so maybe the recipient didn't expect such a personal gift. The act of drawing someone with their actual body type in a public or shared work environment could make them feel exposed or embarrassed. The coworkers are now calling the author an asshole, which adds social pressure. \n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, they had good intentions and put effort into a personalized gift. On the other hand, the recipient felt hurt, and the author might not have considered how the recipient would perceive the drawing. It's possible that the author didn't realize that representing someone's body type, even respectfully, could still be triggering. \n\nIn similar situations, people often argue that the intent vs. impact matters. But in this case, the impact was negative, and the author should have considered the potential for their gift to be hurtful. The fact that the recipient was upset enough to cry suggests that the author did miss the mark, even if unintentionally. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because despite good intentions, the action caused harm and didn't consider the recipient's potential sensitivity around their body image.\n"
