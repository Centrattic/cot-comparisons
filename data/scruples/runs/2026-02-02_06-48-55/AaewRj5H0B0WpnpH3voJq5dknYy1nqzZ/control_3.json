I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who drew an overweight coworker as such in a Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The situation is that the coworker was upset and cried, feeling made to feel fat, and others are calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, intention is key here. The author thought their drawing was cute and respectful, similar to the body types in Steven Universe. They mention it wasn't unflattering, just represented her body type. But the coworker took it as offensive, leading to emotional distress.\n\nNow, even if the intention was good, the outcome matters. The coworker's reaction shows that the gift caused her harm. The author might not have realized how the drawing affected her. But in terms of right or wrong, the act of drawing someone's actual body type can be problematic if it's not consensual. People often have insecurities about their body image, and even a well-meaning drawing can trigger negative feelings.\n\nAlso, workplace dynamics play a role. Secret Santa is supposed to be a lighthearted event. Using a personal characteristic, especially one that can be a sensitive topic, might cross a line. The coworkers' reactions support the idea that the author overstepped, regardless of intent.\n\nSo, while the author didn't mean to be mean, the result was hurtful. The question is whether the author should have known better. Since body image issues are common and the drawing focused on a physical trait that caused distress, it's likely that the author is in the wrong because they failed to consider the potential impact on the coworker's feelings.\n"
