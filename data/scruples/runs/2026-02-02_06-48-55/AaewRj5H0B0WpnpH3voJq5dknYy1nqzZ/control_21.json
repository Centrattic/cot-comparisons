I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who drew an overweight coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The coworkers are upset because the recipient cried about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person made a gift based on what they knew about the recipient, which was that she likes cats. They drew her holding a cat, using shrinking paper, and made it into an ornament. The key point is that they depicted her body type as she is, which is overweight.\n\nThe user is confused because they thought it was a nice, cute gesture, similar to Steven Universe's style, and put a lot of effort into it. But the recipient felt hurt and upset, leading others to say the author is an asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Body image issues are a significant factor here. Even if the drawing isn't unflattering, some people might be sensitive to being depicted as they are, especially in a public or shared context. The author might not have considered that the recipient could feel self-conscious or that the colleagues might perceive it as targeting her weight.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't intend to be unkind and perhaps even meant it as a compliment. However, the impact on the recipient is what matters most. If the recipient felt hurt, then the action had a negative effect. The author's intent is good, but the outcome was harmful. \n\nIn such situations, it's often about the recipient's feelings. The author might not be malicious, but the act of highlighting someone's body type, even if it's positive, can trigger negative emotions. The coworkers' reaction suggests that they see it as inappropriate, possibly because it's a sensitive topic. \n\nI should also consider cultural or social norms. In many workplaces, it's advisable to avoid any art or gifts that could be seen as pointing out someone's physical characteristics, especially body weight. It's a sensitive area, and even well-meaning gestures can cross a line if they make someone feel uncomfortable or targeted.\n\nSo, even if the intention was good, the author might have overlooked the recipient's potential insecurities. The answer could lean towards \"Yes, the author is in the wrong\" because the action caused emotional harm. However, some might argue that the author wasn't in the wrong because they didn't intend harm. But in situations where the recipient is upset, the responsibility is on the giver to be more considerate of possible sensitivities, especially regarding body image.\n"
