I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who drew their coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The coworker ended up being upset, crying in the bathroom, and the author's coworkers say they're an asshole. The author is confused because they thought the drawing was cute and respectful, similar to Steven Universe's body type representation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The drawing was for a Secret Santa exchange. The coworker didn't know it was them, so maybe there's an element of surprise. The author didn't know the coworker well, so maybe they didn't realize how sensitive the coworker is about their weight.\n\nThe coworker's reaction was strong\u2014crying because they felt \"made to feel fat.\" That suggests the drawing had a negative impact on them. The author's coworkers are criticizing them, which adds social pressure. The author is hurt because they put time into the gift and thought it was nice.\n\nBody image issues are personal and can vary a lot. Even if the author intended no harm, the recipient felt hurt. The key here is whether the drawing was flattering or not. The author mentions it's similar to Steven Universe's body types, which are diverse and accepted in a positive light. However, the context here might be different because it's a personal gift. Even if the drawing is technically accurate, if it makes someone feel uncomfortable, it might be problematic.\n\nI should consider cultural norms and sensitivity. Weight is a common sensitive topic. People have different comfort levels. Even if the author didn't intend to be unkind, the act of drawing someone's body as they are could be seen as insensitive if the recipient is self-conscious about it. The author's motivation is to represent the person as they are, but in a social context like Secret Santa, where the gift is a surprise, maybe they should have considered that aspect.\n\nAlso, the coworkers are saying the author is an asshole. That's a strong reaction, but maybe they're taking the coworker's side without knowing the full story. However, the coworker's emotional response is a clear indicator that the gift had a negative effect.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their coworker might perceive the drawing. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was harmful. The question is whether the author should have known better. Since the coworker's reaction was unexpected, but weight is a sensitive issue, the author might have a responsibility to avoid features that could hurt someone's feelings.\n\nSo, weighing the intent against the impact, even if the intent was neutral or positive, the impact was negative. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not anticipating how the recipient might feel.\n"
