I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who drew the overweight girl as overweight during a Secret Santa exchange was in the wrong. The person thought it was a cute gesture, using a Steven Universe style, but the recipient was upset and cried, feeling it made her feel fat. The coworkers are now calling the author an asshole. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't know the recipient well. They made a gift with effort, thinking it was nice. The issue is that representing someone's body type can be sensitive. Even if the intention was positive (like the Steven Universe style, which is more about personality than body issues), the recipient felt hurt. \n\nBody image is a big issue. Even if the artist didn't mean to be offensive, the recipient's feelings are valid. The key here is that the recipient felt bad, and that matters. The author should have considered that not everyone might appreciate being depicted as they are, especially regarding body type. It's possible that the artist didn't realize their own assumptions about body positivity, but in situations where people might have insecurities, it's safer to avoid such depictions unless certain the recipient would appreciate it.\n\nThe coworkers' reaction also suggests that they see this as a problem, so the author might not have been aware of the sensitivity. However, the impact of the gift on the recipient is significant. The author's hurt feelings about the gift not being appreciated are understandable, but the recipient's emotional response is more critical here.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) logic, the standard is about whether the person's actions were inconsiderate or hurtful. Since the recipient was upset and the gift, while meant as a compliment, caused emotional distress, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
