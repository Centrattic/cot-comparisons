I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person asked if they're in the wrong for drawing their coworker as overweight in a secret Santa gift. They drew her as she is, with her body type, which they thought was cute, but the coworker was upset and cried. Now coworkers are calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't know the coworker well. The gift was a drawing of her holding a cat, made into an ornament. The coworker is overweight, and the author depicted her body type. They mentioned it's similar to Steven Universe's style, which is generally body-positive. So the artist might have thought they were being respectful.\n\nBut the recipient was upset, so maybe the author missed something. Even if the artist didn't intend to be unkind, the recipient felt hurt. The key here is that body image issues are personal and sensitive. Even if the artist's intention was good, the recipient's reaction is valid. The author might not have considered the recipient's feelings about their body. It's possible the recipient is self-conscious about her weight and didn't want to be reminded of it, even in a drawing meant as a gift. The coworkers judging the author might be right in that it's better to avoid potentially hurtful depictions, especially in a professional setting where you don't know someone's personal insecurities.\n\nSo, even if the artist didn't mean to be unkind, the act of drawing someone's body type as they are can be problematic if the person isn't comfortable with it. The author should have considered that possibility and maybe asked for preferences or chosen a more generic design. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the recipient's feelings on their body image, leading to hurt feelings. The answer would be A.\n"
