I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a Secret Santa gift where the person drew a picture of their coworker, who is overweight, as she is. The coworker was upset and cried, feeling that the gift made her feel fat. The coworkers now think the author is an asshole, but the author is confused because they thought it was cute and respectful, similar to a Steven Universe style.\n\nFirst, I need to consider body image issues. People can be very sensitive about their weight, especially if they've struggled with self-esteem related to it. The author says they depicted her body type as she is, which might be a positive thing in terms of body positivity, but in this case, it had the opposite effect. The coworker's reaction is a key point here. If someone feels hurt, even if the intention was good, the outcome matters. The author might not have realized that the depiction could trigger negative feelings. \n\nNext, the context of a workplace Secret Santa. Gifts are meant to be thoughtful and considerate. The author didn't know the coworker well, so maybe they didn't have enough insight into her feelings about her body. Even if the drawing is respectful, the act of highlighting her weight might be seen as unkind in a professional setting. The coworkers' support of the upset coworker suggests that the workplace culture prioritizes being inclusive and not making others uncomfortable about their size.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the Steven Universe style, which is known for diverse body representations. However, the effectiveness of such representation can vary based on individual perception. What's empowering for one person might be hurtful to another. The author's intention vs. the recipient's experience is a classic problem in communication.\n\nAnother angle: the author could have avoided this by choosing a different approach. Instead of focusing on body type, maybe they could have drawn her in a scene with her cat without emphasizing physical attributes. Since they didn't know her well, they might not have realized the sensitivity around her weight. But in a professional environment, it's better to be cautious and avoid potential triggers.\n\nSo, putting it all together: while the author didn't have malicious intent, the result was hurtful to the coworker. The responsibility lies in considering how others might receive the gift, especially in a workplace where maintaining a respectful environment is crucial. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not anticipating the emotional impact and not choosing a more neutral representation.\n"
