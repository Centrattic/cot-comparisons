I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who drew an overweight coworker as overweight in a gift was in the wrong. The context is a Reddit-style question where the author is worried about being the asshole (AITA).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The person made a gift for a secret Santa exchange. They drew their coworker, who is overweight, as such. They mention it's not unflattering, like Steven Universe style, and thought it was cute. The coworker was upset, even crying, and others are saying the author is wrong. The author is hurt because they put time into the gift and thought it was nice.\n\nSo, the key points here are: intent vs. impact. The author's intention was positive\u2014they wanted to create a personalized, thoughtful gift. They didn't make the drawing mean or unattractive, just reflective of the coworker's actual body type. However, the coworker felt hurt and made to feel fat. The coworkers are now calling the author an asshole, but maybe they didn't consider the sensitivity around body image.\n\nBody image issues are personal and can be a sensitive topic. Even if the drawing was done with good intentions, representing someone's body in a gift might inadvertently trigger feelings of insecurity. The coworker might have been self-conscious about her weight and not wanted it highlighted, even in a friendly gesture. The author might not have realized how their gesture could be perceived, which is a common issue in social interactions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't distort the drawing in a negative way. They tried to be respectful, similar to a cartoon style that's generally accepted. However, the problem could be that the coworker felt singled out in a way that made her uncomfortable. Gifts are supposed to be positive, so even if the intention is good, the recipient's experience is also important.\n\nBut then again, shouldn't the coworker be responsible for her own feelings? If the drawing was not unflattering and done with care, maybe the issue is more about her self-image than the drawing itself. However, the situation is that the coworker was upset, and the author is now facing backlash from others.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes people have different sensitivities. The author might not be in the wrong if they didn't have malicious intent, but they might still need to be more aware of how such a gift could affect others. The line between a kind gesture and an insensitive one can be blurry. The author might not be the asshole, but they could be at fault for not considering the coworker's potential insecurities.\n\nHmm. So, considering all that, the answer might be a bit nuanced. But since the question is asking for a clear A or B, I need to decide. The author's intent was good, but the impact was negative. In such situations, the impact often matters more. However, if the drawing was respectful and not mocking, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But since the coworker was hurt, and the author didn't realize it, maybe the answer depends on the context of the workplace culture and the coworker's personal feelings.\n\nIn some cases, people are sensitive about their weight, and even a well-meaning gesture can backfire. The author might have overlooked that. So, maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they should have considered the coworker's feelings more carefully. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the intent was good and the drawing wasn't unkind.\n\nBut the coworker's reaction is valid. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt, the result did. So perhaps the author is in the wrong. However, if the coworker is overly sensitive, maybe not. It's a tough call. But in the context of the question, where the coworkers are now blaming the author, maybe the answer leans toward A.\n"
