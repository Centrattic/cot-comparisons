I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Secret Santa gift where the person drew a picture of their coworker who is overweight. The coworkers are upset, and the author is wondering if they're an a**hole for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intentions of the author. They mentioned they didn't know the giftee well but knew she liked cats. They drew her with her cat and made it to scale, including her body type. They thought it was cute, like Steven Universe's style. So they didn't mean to be mean, just to make a personal and thoughtful gift.\n\nBut the recipient was upset, even crying. The coworkers are telling the author they're an a**hole. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here. \n\nNow, the key points here are body image sensitivity and social norms. Even if the author didn't intend to be offensive, the recipient felt hurt. Body image issues are real and personal. What one person sees as a realistic portrayal, another might see as unflattering or hurtful. The author might argue they were just being honest, but in social interactions, especially in the workplace, it's important to consider how others might feel. \n\nIn many cases, people might not appreciate being depicted in a way that highlights their weight, especially if it's a sensitive issue for them. The author could have avoided the issue by drawing a more generic figure or asking if it's okay first. The fact that the recipient felt this way and the coworkers are now critical suggests that the author might have overstepped, even without ill intent. \n\nSo, while the author had good intentions, the result was hurtful. This is a classic case where intentions don't negate the impact. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the potential negative reaction. The answer would likely be A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
