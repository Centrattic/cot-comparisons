I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for drawing an overweight coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift. The situation is that the coworker was upset and cried because the drawing made her feel fat, and now others are calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author drew the coworker in a way that reflected her body type, using a style similar to Steven Universe, which is supposed to be cute. They put a lot of time into it and thought it was nice. But the recipient felt hurt. \n\nThe key issue here is body image sensitivity. Even if the author didn't intend harm, the recipient's reaction is valid. People can have different sensitivities about how their bodies are represented, especially in a workplace setting where relationships might be more formal. The author might not have considered that drawing someone's body type, even in a cartoonish way, could trigger negative feelings about their weight.\n\nAlso, workplace dynamics matter. Secret Santa is usually about lighthearted, friendly gifts. If the recipient felt targeted or made to feel uncomfortable, that could affect the workplace environment. The author's coworkers are now criticizing them, which suggests there's a social expectation here that the author might have violated.\n\nAnother angle: was the drawing respectful? If it's a flattering or neutral portrayal, maybe not. But if the recipient felt it was mocking, even if it wasn't intended, the author should still consider the impact. Intention vs. impact is a common debate in these scenarios. The author might have good intentions, but the impact on the recipient is what matters here.\n\nAlso, the fact that the recipient didn't know them well might mean that the author didn't have enough insight into her feelings about her body. Assuming it's okay to draw someone's body type without knowing their personal feelings about it could be risky. It's possible the coworker has body image issues that the author wasn't aware of.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author didn't mean to harm, the act of drawing someone's body type in a way that made them cry is problematic. The author should have considered the potential impact and perhaps opted for a more neutral or abstract representation. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
