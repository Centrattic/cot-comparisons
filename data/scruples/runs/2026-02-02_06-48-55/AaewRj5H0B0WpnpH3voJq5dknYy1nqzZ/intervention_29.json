I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about a secret Santa exchange where the person drew their coworker, who is overweight, as overweight in a drawing on an ornament. The coworker was upset and cried because it made her feel fat, and other coworkers are upset with the author.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they didn't know the giftee well but knew she liked cats. They drew her holding a cat, and they included her body type, making her look overweight. They thought it was cute and put time into it. The question is whether they were wrong to do that.\n\nBody image and body positivity are big topics. People can have different reactions to how their bodies are portrayed, especially in art. Even if the artist intended it to be flattering, like the Steven Universe style which is known for diverse body types, the recipient might still feel hurt. The key here is intent versus impact. The author's intent was to create a nice, personalized gift, but the impact was negative. \n\nThe coworker's reaction is important. She felt upset enough to cry, which suggests the drawing affected her deeply. The author's coworkers also think they were wrong, adding social pressure. However, the author feels hurt because they put effort into the gift. \n\nI need to consider if it's wrong to depict someone as they are in a gift, even if it's a sensitive subject. Some might argue it's not the author's fault because they didn't intend harm. Others might say that regardless of intent, making someone feel self-conscious about their body is hurtful. \n\nIn many cases, people have different boundaries about how their bodies are represented. What one person finds flattering, another might find offensive. The author didn't know the coworker well, so maybe they didn't realize that depicting her weight could be an issue. However, the act of drawing someone's body type as they are might not be the issue itself, but the context and how it's received.\n\nIt's possible that the author is in the wrong because even if the intention was good, the result was hurtful. The coworker's emotional response indicates that the action had a negative effect. In such situations, the impact is often what matters most, regardless of intent. So, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted because the author didn't have ill intent. It's a tricky situation where good intentions can still lead to harm.\n"
