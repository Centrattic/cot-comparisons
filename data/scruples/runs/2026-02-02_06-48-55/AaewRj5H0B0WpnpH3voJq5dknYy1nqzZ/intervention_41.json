I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post about drawing an overweight coworker as overweight is in the wrong. The situation is a Secret Santa exchange where they made an ornament with the person's body type, which led to the coworker crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider body image and sensitivity. The author didn't know the person well, so maybe they didn't realize the impact of the drawing. They mentioned it was a Steven Universe-style body type, which is more inclusive, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's acceptable in all contexts. \n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. The author's intention was to create a personalized, thoughtful gift, which is positive. However, the impact was negative\u2014making the coworker feel self-conscious about her body. Even if the drawing wasn't unflattering, the act of highlighting weight could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the coworkers are now telling the author they're an asshole, which suggests that the workplace culture might be sensitive about such issues. The author might not have considered how body weight is a sensitive topic and that even well-meaning gestures can have unintended consequences. \n\nBut wait, the author did put effort into the gift and tried to be respectful by not making it unflattering. Should they be expected to anticipate that? It's a tough spot. On one hand, the author didn't mean to hurt, but on the other, body image is a real issue. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author should have known. Since the coworker is overweight and the author chose to include that in the drawing, even if it was a respectful style, it's possible that the coworker felt judged or made to feel bad. The author might have overlooked the emotional impact, so they might be in the wrong unintentionally. \n\nHowever, if the coworker's reaction was out of proportion, maybe not. But the fact that she cried and the author's coworkers support her suggests that the author did something inappropriate. The author should perhaps have avoided highlighting weight unless they had a close relationship with the coworker where such a personal detail was acceptable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards AITA being in the wrong. The author's intent was good, but the action led to harm, so they might be at fault for not considering the sensitivity of the coworker's body image.\n"
