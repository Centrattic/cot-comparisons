I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who drew an overweight coworker as such in a gift is in the wrong. The situation involves a Secret Santa exchange where the gift was a drawing of the coworker holding a cat, made to her actual size. The coworker was upset and cried, feeling that the drawing made her feel fat, and coworkers are calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the drawing was a realistic representation of the coworker's body type, similar to Steven Universe's inclusive approach. They thought it was cute and put time into it. However, the recipient was hurt. The key here is whether the author should have modified the drawing to avoid making the coworker uncomfortable.\n\nBody image issues are significant. Even if the author didn't intend to offend, the result was that the coworker felt bad. Intentions matter, but so do the impact of actions. The question is whether the author should have anticipated that representing someone's actual body type in a gift could be hurtful. In a workplace, it's important to be sensitive to colleagues' feelings, especially in a context like Secret Santa where the gift is personal.\n\nThe coworkers' reaction suggests that there's a social norm against representing someone's appearance in a way that could be perceived as unflattering. Even if the author thought it was a compliment or realistic, the coworker's emotional response indicates it wasn't received that way. The author might have failed to consider the coworker's potential insecurities about weight, which is a common issue. \n\nHowever, the author didn't have any malicious intent. They based the drawing on the coworker's preference for cats and tried to make it personal. The problem arises from the misjudgment of the coworker's feelings. In professional settings, it's often safer to avoid any personal features that might be sensitive unless the relationship is very close and the person has expressed comfort with such things.\n\nSo, while the author didn't mean to hurt, the act of drawing the coworker's body type as is could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since the coworker was upset. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they should have been more mindful of the potential impact, even if unintended.\n"
