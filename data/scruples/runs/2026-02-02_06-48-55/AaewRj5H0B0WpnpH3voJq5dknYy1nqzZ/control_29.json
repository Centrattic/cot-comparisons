I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who drew an overweight coworker as such in a secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The key points here are body image sensitivity, the context of the gift, and the reaction it caused.\n\nFirst, the person drew their coworker accurately, noting they represented her body type as in Steven Universe, which is known for diverse body types. They intended it as a nice, personal gift. But the coworker was upset, felt hurt, and even cried. The coworkers are now calling the gift-giver an asshole. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author didn't intend to be offensive. They thought it was a kind gesture, and the drawing wasn't unflattering. On the other hand, the recipient was hurt, which is a valid reaction. Body image issues can be very sensitive, and even well-meaning actions can have unintended negative effects.\n\nThe author might not have considered how the recipient would feel about their body being highlighted, even if it's accurate. While the drawing wasn't mean-spirited, the context of a gift should prioritize the recipient's comfort. Maybe the author could have asked if it's okay to include a personal touch or opt for a less personal approach next time. Since the recipient was clearly hurt, even if unintentional, the impact matters. So, there's a case to say the author is in the wrong for not foreseeing the emotional impact. But some might argue that the author isn't at fault for the recipient's reaction. However, given the outcome, the answer is likely A.\n"
