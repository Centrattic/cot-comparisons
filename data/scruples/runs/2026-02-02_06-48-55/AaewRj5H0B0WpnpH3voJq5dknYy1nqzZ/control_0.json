I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who drew an overweight coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The situation is that they made an ornament with the girl and her cat, and the coworker was upset because it made her feel fat. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person didn't know their giftee that well, but they noticed she was a cat person. They drew her accurately in terms of body type, which is a real characteristic. They mention it's similar to Steven Universe's style, which usually represents characters with diverse body types. The person thought it was cute and put time into it. However, the recipient was upset, even crying.\n\nNow, the key points here are intentions versus impact. The author intended to represent the coworker accurately and even found it cute. However, the recipient felt made to feel fat. Even if the intention was neutral or positive, the impact was negative. The coworkers are now calling the author an asshole, which adds social pressure.\n\nBody image is a sensitive issue. Representing someone's body type can be a touchy subject, especially in a workplace where people might not be close. Even if the drawing wasn't unflattering, the fact that it highlighted the person's size might have triggered insecurities. The author might not have considered that the recipient could feel self-conscious about it.\n\nOn the other hand, altering someone's appearance for a gift might be seen as dishonest. The author could argue they were being respectful by representing the person as they are. But there's also a responsibility to consider how others might perceive things. Maybe the author should have been more cautious, perhaps by offering to change it if needed or considering that the recipient might not want their body type highlighted.\n\nIn situations like Secret Santa, people often expect a fun, light-hearted gift. If the drawing was meant to be a personal touch, but it caused distress, then the author might have overlooked the recipient's potential sensitivity. It's possible that even a well-intended gesture can cause harm if the recipient interprets it negatively.\n\nSo, weighing intentions against impact, while the intention was good, the impact was harmful. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how the recipient could feel about their body type being depicted, even if accurately. It's a classic case where good intentions don't excuse the hurt caused. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
