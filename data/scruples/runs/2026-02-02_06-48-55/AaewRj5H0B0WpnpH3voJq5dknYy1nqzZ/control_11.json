I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who drew an overweight coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The key points here are the intent, the context of the relationship between the individuals, and the impact of the gift.\n\nFirst, the author intended a kind gesture, creating a personalized ornament. They included the coworker's cat, which they knew she liked. The drawing included her body type, which they thought was similar to characters like in Steven Universe, which is known for diverse body representations. However, the coworker was upset and even cried, feeling that the drawing made her feel fat. Now the author is confused because they didn't mean any harm and put effort into the gift.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The coworker's reaction is important here. While the author didn't have a malicious intent, they might not have considered that the coworker could be sensitive about her weight. The issue here is about respecting someone's feelings and boundaries, even if unintentional. The coworkers are calling the author an asshole, which suggests that in their office culture, this might be seen as inappropriate. \n\nThe author's assumption that it was \"cute\" based on their own perspective might not have considered the recipient's possible insecurities. Even if the body type was drawn in a stylized, non-unflattering way, the mere act of highlighting weight could be triggering. The problem isn't necessarily the drawing's style but the content. The author should have considered whether drawing someone's specific body type in a group setting could be perceived as a personal jab, especially when they don't know the person well.\n\nIn terms of cultural context, there's a growing awareness about body image issues and the importance of being sensitive to how others perceive such things. While the author's intention was positive, the impact on the recipient is what matters here. The author might not be in the wrong entirely because there was no malice, but they did fail to consider the potential negative impact. Therefore, the answer would lean towards AITA (they are in the wrong) because they should have been more cautious about the content given the personal nature of the gift and the recipient's sensitivity to the issue.\n"
