I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who drew their coworker as overweight in a gift was in the wrong. The situation is that they did a secret Santa exchange, and the person made an ornament drawing of their coworkee, a cat person, which they shrunk down. The coworkee is overweight, and the author drew her body type as such, intending it to be cute, like the Steven Universe style. But the coworkee was upset and cried, feeling it made her feel fat, and now coworkers are saying the author is an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether representing someone's actual body type in a gift is offensive or not. The author thought it was a good, cute gesture, but the recipient felt hurt. The question is about intent versus impact. The author's intention was positive, but the impact was negative. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nBody image issues are real and sensitive. Even if the artist didn't intend to be unflattering, the reality is that the recipient felt hurt. The author might not have considered how the recipient would perceive the representation. While art can be subjective, using someone's likeness, especially in a personal gift, requires sensitivity. Even if the artist believed it was respectful, the fact that the recipient felt bad could mean the artist was in the wrong. However, some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't intend harm and were trying to be kind. But generally, when someone's action causes hurt feelings, even without intent, there's a responsibility to acknowledge the impact and perhaps apologize.\n\nAlso, the coworker's reaction is significant. Crying and feeling upset indicates a strong negative reaction. The author might need to consider that body shaming, even unintentionally, can be damaging. The key here is whether the author should have anticipated the sensitivity around body image. Since the coworkee is overweight, and representing that in art could be triggering, the author might have been careless. Even if it's a common body type in media, like Steven Universe, people's personal experiences vary. The author's lack of awareness of the coworkee's feelings is a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author's portrayal was respectful and not mocking, maybe it's a misunderstanding. But the fact that the coworkee was upset enough to cry suggests that the author's portrayal crossed a line. So, in terms of accountability, the author should be in the wrong for not considering the recipient's feelings and body image issues, even if the intention was good. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
