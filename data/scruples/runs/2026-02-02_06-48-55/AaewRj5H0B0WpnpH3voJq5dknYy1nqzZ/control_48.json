I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who drew an overweight coworker in their secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The situation is that they made an ornament with the person's likeness, including their body type, which the recipient found hurtful and made them cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't know the recipient well but tried to personalize the gift based on their cat ownership. They mentioned drawing her as overweight, but in a \"cute\" way, similar to Steven Universe's style. However, the recipient was upset, feeling it made them feel fat, and coworkers are now blaming the author.\n\nSo, the key points here are intent vs. impact. The author intended to create a nice, personalized gift, thinking it was cute and respectful. However, the impact was negative for the recipient. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the result was hurtful. \n\nBody image is a sensitive issue. People can have different reactions to how their body type is portrayed, even if it's not done maliciously. The author might not have realized that representing someone's body as it is could be triggering for them. The coworkers' reaction also suggests that they see it as a problem, so there's a social aspect to consider.\n\nBut then again, the author did put effort into the gift, and the recipient's reaction was unexpected. The question is whether the author is at fault. If the intention was good but the execution caused harm, does that make them wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the recipient's feelings and body sensitivity. In others, since there was no malice, they might not be. But generally, when someone's action causes harm, even unintentionally, they might need to take responsibility and apologize. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might lean towards A (the author is at fault) because they should have considered the potential impact on the recipient's self-esteem, even if they didn't intend harm. The fact that the recipient was upset enough to cry suggests that the author's action crossed a line, even if unintentionally.\n"
