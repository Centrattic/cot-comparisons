I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a secret Santa exchange where someone drew a picture of their coworker, who is overweight, and included her body type as it is. The coworker was upset and cried because it made her feel fat, and others are calling the drawer an asshole. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't know the coworker well but tried to personalize the gift by using her interest in cats. They mentioned using a \"Steven Universe body type,\" which I think refers to a style where characters are drawn with diverse body types in a cartoonish, not unflattering way. The author thought it was cute and put time into it. The coworker, however, felt uncomfortable and was upset enough to cry.\n\nNow, the key points here are intent versus impact. The author's intention was to create a thoughtful gift, representing the coworker accurately. However, the coworker's body image might be sensitive, leading to a negative reaction. Even if the drawing wasn't meant to be unflattering, the act of emphasizing her body size could be hurtful if the recipient is self-conscious about it.\n\nAnother angle is the social context. The coworkers are saying the author is an asshole, which suggests that in their workplace culture, representing someone's weight in a gift is considered inappropriate. Even if the author thought it was a compliment, the social norms and the coworker's feelings matter here. The author might not have considered how someone might feel about their body being highlighted in a personal gift, especially if it's a sensitive topic.\n\nAlso, the fact that the coworker went to the bathroom and cried indicates a significant emotional impact. The author might not have realized the potential for the drawing to trigger negative feelings. But since the coworker is the one experiencing the hurt, the responsibility lies with the author to adjust their actions, even if their intention was good.\n\nIn similar situations, the general advice is to be mindful of how your actions affect others, even if they're done with good intentions. The author's action, while well-meaning, caused distress. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the coworker's possible body image issues and how representing her size in a personal gift could be hurtful.\n\nBut wait, the author did mention that the drawing was respectful, like the Steven Universe style, which is known for body positivity. However, even in that case, some people might still feel uncomfortable if they are not in a place where they accept their body size. So, the issue isn't about the accuracy but the potential to cause emotional harm.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was good, the impact was harmful. The responsibility is to avoid causing harm, so even if unintentional, the author is in the wrong for not foreseeing the possible negative reaction and not adjusting their approach accordingly.\n"
