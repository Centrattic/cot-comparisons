I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who drew the overweight girl as overweight in a Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The situation is that the coworker was upset and cried because the drawing made her feel fat, and now others are saying the author is an asshole. The author is hurt because they put time into the gift and thought it was nice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider body image issues. The coworker is apparently overweight, and the drawing depicted her actual body type. Even if the author intended it to be flattering, like in a Steven Universe style, it still made the recipient feel bad. The key here is whether the author had the right to depict someone's body as they are in a gift, especially when they don't know the person that well.\n\nThe author didn't know the coworker well, so maybe they didn't realize that the coworker might be sensitive about her body image. However, the responsibility to be considerate might still lie with the giver. Even if the intent was positive, the result caused emotional harm. The question is about intent versus impact. While the author didn't mean to hurt, the impact was negative. In such cases, the impact often takes precedence.\n\nAlso, considering that the coworker had an emotional reaction, it's important to acknowledge her feelings. The author might have thought it was a compliment, but body positivity isn't universal. Some people, regardless of their size, may not appreciate having their appearance highlighted, especially if they have insecurities. The author's lack of awareness about the coworker's feelings could be seen as a failure to be considerate.\n\nMoreover, the coworkers are calling the author an asshole, which suggests a social backlash. In workplace settings, people often expect a certain level of sensitivity. The author might have overstepped by including a personal feature that wasn't universally positive. Even if it was a good-natured gesture, the result was hurtful, which could make the author at fault.\n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to be thoughtful by creating a handmade gift and based it on the recipient's interests (cats). They might feel they were being genuine. However, the issue is that they included a feature (body type) that the recipient found offensive. Since the author didn't ask for permission or consider the possibility of the recipient's sensitivity, it's a valid point to question their judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was positive, the action caused harm. The responsibility lies in considering how the gift might be received, especially when dealing with personal characteristics that can be sensitive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being more cautious about the recipient's potential feelings about their body image.\n"
