I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who drew their coworker as overweight in a Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The situation involves a gift meant to be personal and thoughtful, but it backfired because the recipient felt hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent. The author made the ornament based on the coworker's love for cats and wanted to include her body type accurately. They mention it was nothing unflattering, like a Steven Universe style, which is known for diverse body types. The intention seems positive, but the outcome was negative. \n\nNext, the recipient's reaction is key. She was upset to the point of crying, which indicates a strong emotional response. Even if the artist didn't mean to offend, the impact is what matters here. The coworkers are now saying the author is an asshole, adding to the social tension.\n\nBody image is a sensitive issue. Even if the artist thought the representation was neutral or positive, the recipient might have a different perspective. People's feelings about their body can vary, and even well-intentioned actions can cause harm. The fact that the author put a lot of time into the gift shows effort, but the result was hurtful. \n\nIt's important to consider that the recipient might feel that having her weight depicted, even accurately, in a gift from a coworker she doesn't know well could make her feel singled out or mocked. The workplace environment adds another layer\u2014Secret Santa is supposed to be fun and positive, and the reaction suggests the gift crossed a line.\n\nSo, even if the artist didn't intend to be offensive, the action caused distress. The question is whether the artist is in the wrong. Since the recipient felt hurt and the coworkers are criticizing the artist, it's likely the author is at fault here. The answer would be AITA (Am I the Asshole) in this case. Therefore, Answer A (Yes) seems appropriate.\n"
