Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe person did a secret Santa gift for a coworker they don't know that well. The coworker is a big cat person, so they drew her holding a cat, shrunk it into an ornament. The coworker is overweight, and the author drew her body type as such, using a style similar to Steven Universe, which they describe as not unflattering. They thought it was cute. However, the coworker was upset, even crying, because the drawing made her feel fat. Now the author is being called an asshole by coworkers for drawing her as overweight. The author is hurt because they put a lot of time into the gift and felt it was nice. The question is whether they should have drawn her as thin even if she isn't, and if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's intent was good, but the recipient was offended. The author didn't know the person well enough to know how she might feel about her body image. The coworkers are now criticizing the author, leading to the question of whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the aspect of body image and sensitivity. Drawing someone's body type accurately can be a sensitive issue. Even if the artist thinks it's a positive or flattering depiction, the recipient might not see it that way. Body image issues are personal and vary a lot from person to person. Even if the author didn't mean to be unkind, the result caused emotional distress. That's a problem.\n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't make it unflattering, using a style they compare to Steven Universe, which is known for diverse body types. However, the recipient's reaction is the key here. If the gift caused her to cry and feel bad about herself, that's a strong indicator that the action was hurtful, regardless of the artist's intent.\n\nAnother angle is the level of familiarity. The author mentions they don't know the coworker that well. If they had a close relationship, they might be more aware of how the coworker feels about her body. But since they don't, they might not have the knowledge to make that artistic choice. It's a classic case of not knowing enough about someone's personal sensitivities.\n\nThe coworkers' reaction also suggests that in their workplace culture, depicting someone's body type in a gift is considered inappropriate or offensive. The author might have violated an unspoken norm, even if they didn't intend to. So, even if the author's intention was good, the action still caused harm, which could make them at fault.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did put effort into the gift, based on the coworker's interests (cats). The fact that the coworker was upset doesn't mean the effort was wrong, but the choice to depict her body type might have been the issue. The question is whether accurately representing someone's body is ever wrong, especially when it's not malicious.\n\nI think the crux here is that while the author had good intentions, they may not have considered the potential impact on the recipient's self-esteem. The recipient's feelings are valid, and causing someone to feel bad about their body, even unintentionally, is a mistake. So the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider how the recipient might perceive the drawing, and the result was emotional harm. The author should have either avoided depicting the body type or asked the recipient about their preferences if possible.\n"
