I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person drew a coworker as overweight for a Secret Santa gift. The coworker was upset and even cried because she felt it made her feel fat. The coworkers are now calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, the author's intention was to make a personalized gift, using the recipient's love for cats. They included her body type in the drawing, which is different from her actual size. The key point here is whether depicting someone's actual body type is inappropriate, especially in a gift setting where the recipient might feel sensitive about it.\n\nThe author mentions they thought it was \"cute\" and similar to Steven Universe's style, which is known for diverse body representations. But the recipient's reaction suggests it was hurtful. Even if the author didn't mean to be unkind, the impact is what matters here. People can have body image issues, and even a well-intentioned drawing might trigger negative feelings. \n\nIn a workplace context, using someone's body type in a gift, especially when not close, can be risky. The coworkers' response indicates that they saw it as a mistake. The author could have opted for a more generic representation to avoid potential hurt feelings. \n\nSo, while the author didn't intend harm, the result caused emotional distress. The question is whether the author is at fault. Given the outcome and the social context, the answer leans towards AITA being the author's fault. The key factors are the recipient's reaction and the potential insensitivity, despite good intentions.\n"
