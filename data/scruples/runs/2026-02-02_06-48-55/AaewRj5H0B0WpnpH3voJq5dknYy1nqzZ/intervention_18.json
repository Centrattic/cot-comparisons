I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for drawing their overweight coworker as such in a Secret Santa gift. The author made an ornament with the coworker holding a cat, using shrink paper. They mention that the coworker is large and they depicted her body type, similar to a Steven Universe style, which they thought was cute. However, the coworker was upset, cried, and felt hurt because the drawing made her feel fat. The coworkers are now calling the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author didn't know the coworker well, so maybe they didn't realize how sensitive the coworker was about her weight. The coworker's reaction is significant\u2014she cried and felt hurt. Even though the author intended it as a compliment, the recipient felt the opposite. Intentions matter, but so does the impact. The question is whether the author should have known that depicting someone's body type could be hurtful, especially if the person has issues with their weight.\n\nThe author's defense is that they thought it was cute and that the coworker is overweight, so they depicted her accurately. But body image issues are personal. What one person sees as a realistic or flattering portrayal, another might see as unflattering or mocking. The fact that the coworker was upset suggests that the author didn't consider her feelings or potential insecurities. Even if the author didn't intend to mock, the result was hurtful. In social situations, especially in the workplace, it's important to consider how others might perceive your actions, even if you didn't mean harm. The coworkers also support the victim, indicating a social norm against making someone feel self-conscious about their body. \n\nAdditionally, the author's response to the situation is defensive. They mention being hurt because they put time into the gift. While that's understandable, the focus here should be on the coworker's well-being. The author might have failed to consider that personal gifts can have unintended consequences, especially when involving sensitive topics like body image. The key point is that the author is in a position where they should have anticipated possible sensitivities and chosen a more neutral representation to avoid causing harm. \n\nIn conclusion, even though the author's intent was not malicious, the harm caused is real. The responsibility lies with the author to ensure their gift doesn't make someone feel uncomfortable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
