I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Secret Santa. The person drew a picture of their coworker, who is overweight, as overweight in an ornament. They thought it was cute, like the Steven Universe style. But the coworker was upset, even crying, because she felt it made her feel fat. Now the coworkers are saying the author is an asshole.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. The coworker didn't know who was giving the gift, so it was a surprise. The author might not have intended to hurt her feelings. They put time into the gift, which shows they tried to be thoughtful. But the outcome was negative. \n\nBody image issues are sensitive. Even if the author thought it was a realistic or kind representation, the recipient interpreted it as making her feel bad about her weight. The problem here is that the author may not have considered how the recipient would feel. Even if the coworker is overweight, depicting that in a gift could trigger insecurities. \n\nAnother angle: the author says they drew her body type to \"represent that,\" which implies they were being truthful. But maybe the issue is that they didn't realize that body type can be a sensitive topic. Also, in a workplace setting, colleagues might have different comfort levels. The author might have assumed it was a compliment, but the receiver didn't see it that way. \n\nSteven Universe has diverse body types, which is often praised for inclusivity. So the author might have thought referencing that style was positive. However, the context here is a personal gift, not a public animation. The personal nature might make it more hurtful because it's directed at an individual.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They didn't mean to harm her, but they didn't consider her feelings. Intentions vs. impact. The coworkers are upset now, so maybe the author should have been more cautious. Even if the intention was good, the effect was harmful. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't take into account the recipient's possible sensitivity about her body image.\n"
