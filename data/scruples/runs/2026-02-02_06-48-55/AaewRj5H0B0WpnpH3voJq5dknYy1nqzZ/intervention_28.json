I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who drew the overweight girl as she is in the Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The context says that the coworker received an ornament drawing of herself as overweight, which she found upsetting, leading to her crying and others calling the author an asshole. The author thought it was a nice gesture, using a Steven Universe style, and is hurt because they put time into it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is body image and whether it's appropriate to depict someone's actual body type in a gift. The author's intention was to create a personalized, cute gift based on the coworker's interest in cats. They didn't intend to be unflattering, but the result made the recipient feel bad.\n\nBody image is a sensitive topic. Even if the author didn't mean any harm, the act of highlighting someone's weight, especially in a way that differs from common media representations (like Steven Universe's inclusive approach), might still be problematic. The recipient's reaction is important here\u2014she felt it made her feel fat. That's a significant emotional impact.\n\nThe author's defense is that they didn't draw anything super unflattering, but the fact that the recipient was made to feel bad is the key point. Even if the drawing is accurate and not exaggerated, representing someone's weight in a gift might not be the best choice, especially when you don't know the person well. It's possible that the recipient is particularly sensitive about her body image, which the author couldn't have known. \n\nAlso, the coworkers are on the author's side? Wait, the coworkers told the author they're an asshole. Wait, the user said \"my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as overweight.\" So the author's coworkers think they're wrong. The author might be in a position where their good intentions were overshadowed by unintended harm. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's mistake might be in assuming that representing someone's actual body type is acceptable without considering the recipient's feelings. Even with good intentions, not all actions are appropriate. The author might have failed to consider the potential for hurt feelings, which is a common issue in similar situations. \n\nIn similar \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenarios, the resolution often hinges on empathy and considering the other person's perspective. The author might have thought they were being kind and personalized, but the act of drawing someone's weight in a gift could be seen as insensitive. The fact that the recipient was upset and cried suggests that it was hurtful. \n\nSo even if the author didn't intend to be unkind, the result was harmful. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the sensitivity around body image, which is a valid concern. Therefore, the correct choice is A.\n"
