I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who drew an overweight coworker in a Secret Santa gift is in the wrong. The situation is about a Secret Santa exchange where the gift was a drawing of the coworker as overweight, which upset her. The coworkers are saying the author is an asshole, but the author is hurt because they put time into the gift and thought it was nice.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author drew the coworker accurately in terms of body type, which the coworker is self-conscious about. The coworker was upset and even cried, indicating that the gift made her feel fat. The coworkers are judging the author, but the author is confused because they meant well and thought it was a cute gesture, similar to a Steven Universe style.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether representing someone's body type as they are, even if it's different from societal standards, is appropriate in a gift. The author didn't exaggerate, just depicted her as she is, which might not be flattering to her. The coworker's reaction suggests that she was sensitive about her weight, and the gift made her feel uncomfortable. \n\nThere's a balance between artistic representation and respecting someone's feelings. Even if the author intended it as a compliment, the recipient perceived it negatively. The fact that the coworkers are calling the author an asshole implies that there's a social expectation to avoid such depictions, especially in a workplace setting where people might have different sensitivities.\n\nAlso, the author might not have considered that even if the drawing is accurate, it could trigger insecurities. The question is about intention versus impact. The author's intention was to be kind, but the impact was hurtful. In such cases, the impact is often what matters more in social contexts. \n\nThe author could have chosen a different artistic style or avoided depicting the body type if they were unsure. Since it's a gift, the recipient's comfort should be a priority. The author might have a valid argument about the time and effort, but the hurt caused is significant. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the recipient's feelings about their body image. Even if it was accurate, it was hurtful. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
