I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe user did a secret Santa exchange and drew their coworker, who is overweight, in a drawing that included her body type. They mentioned that they tried to make it cute, similar to Steven Universe's style. The coworker was upset, cried, and now others are calling the author an asshole. The author is confused because they thought their coworker would appreciate the effort and the personalized gift.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context of body image. Being overweight can be sensitive for some people, even if the intention wasn't to be unflattering. The coworker felt hurt, which is a valid emotional response. The author might have thought they were being kind and respectful by including her actual body type, but perhaps the coworker was self-conscious about it. The key here is whether the author should have considered the coworker's feelings about their body before including that detail.\n\nThe author argues that they didn't make it unflattering and thought it was cute. However, even if the intention was good, the outcome caused emotional distress. The coworker's reaction shows that the gift had a negative impact. The author's defense is that the coworker is \"not thin,\" implying that it's not their fault for representing her as she is. But the issue is about how the recipient perceived it. The author might be missing the point that the coworker's self-image is important, regardless of the author's intent.\n\nAnother angle is the workplace dynamic. Secret Santa is supposed to be a fun, light-hearted event. Causing someone to cry and feel hurt undermines the purpose. The author might not have considered the potential for the drawing to make the coworker feel uncomfortable, especially if they don't know her well. The coworkers' reaction that the author is an asshole suggests that their actions were seen as insensitive.\n\nThe Steven Universe reference is a bit tricky. Steven Universe is known for diverse body types, which is a positive representation. However, the author's own interpretation of that style might not align with how the coworker experienced it. Even if it's a positive representation in media, in a personal context, the individual's sensitivity takes precedence.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the principle of not harming others applies here. The author intended no harm but caused harm regardless. The question is whether the author should have foreseen that possibility. Since body image is a sensitive topic, it's possible that the author should have refrained from including the body type, especially since the coworker might have felt self-conscious.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did put effort into personalizing the gift, which is commendable. The intention was to create a meaningful and thoughtful present. However, the outcome indicates that the gift was not well-received, and the author needs to take responsibility for that. The coworkers' judgment that the author is an asshole might be a bit harsh, but the fact that the coworker was upset means the author did something wrong, even if unintentionally.\n\nIn summary, while the author had good intentions, they failed to consider the coworker's feelings about her body type. The coworker's emotional reaction shows that the action, though well-meaning, was inappropriate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being sensitive to the coworker's self-perception.\n"
