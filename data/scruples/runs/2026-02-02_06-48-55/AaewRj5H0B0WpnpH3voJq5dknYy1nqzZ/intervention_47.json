I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to understand the situation properly.\n\nThe person, let's call them the author, did a Secret Santa exchange and drew a gift for a coworker who is overweight. The coworker didn't like the gift, cried because it made her feel fat, and now the author is being called an asshole. The author is confused because they thought their drawing was cute and tried to represent the coworker's body type realistically. They're wondering if they should have drawn her as thinner instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author created a personalized gift, which they put a lot of time into. The coworker is described as \"a rather large girl,\" and the author chose to depict her actual body type in the drawing. They mention that it's similar to a Steven Universe body type, which I know from the show often has diverse body types represented in a non-stereotypical way. The coworker's reaction was negative, leading to her emotional distress.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). From the user's perspective, they think the author is in the wrong but are curious about others' opinions.\n\nI need to analyze this from different angles. One angle is intent versus impact. The author's intention was to create a thoughtful, personalized gift. They didn't mean to be unkind, just to represent the person as they are. However, the impact was negative. The coworker felt hurt and upset, which is a significant emotional reaction. \n\nAnother angle is the context of body image and societal pressures. Body image issues are sensitive topics. Even if someone is trying to be realistic or inclusive, others might perceive it as focusing on their appearance in a way that's hurtful. The coworker might have felt that being depicted as overweight in a gift was a reminder of her self-image struggles. \n\nAlso, the coworker didn't know the author well, so the author might not have been aware of the coworker's feelings about her body. Without that knowledge, the author might not have realized that this representation could be problematic. However, in a workplace setting, even if the coworker is a stranger, the author should consider that people have different sensitivities regarding how their body is portrayed.\n\nAnother point is the concept of \"representation\" in art. The author thought it was cute and similar to Steven Universe's style, which is known for diverse characters. But maybe the issue here isn't just the body type but the context of a gift from a coworker. Perhaps the coworker felt it was inappropriate for someone else to draw her body type, especially in a personal gift. The act of drawing someone's body type could be seen as intrusive or as making a comment on their appearance, which the coworker didn't appreciate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could argue that they were trying to be inclusive and realistic. They didn't make fun of her or draw her in an unflattering way, just as she is. The problem might stem from the coworker's personal insecurities rather than the author's intent.\n\nIn similar AITA scenarios, the common advice is that even if the intent is good, the impact matters. If someone's actions cause harm, they should take responsibility and apologize. The author here did cause emotional distress, even if unintentionally. So, the onus is on the author to acknowledge the coworker's feelings and make amends.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's action, while well-intentioned, had a negative impact. Since they didn't consider that their coworker might be sensitive about her body image, they might be at fault for not anticipating that reaction. Therefore, the answer could lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but there's a nuance here because the intent wasn't malicious.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the coworker overreacted, and the author isn't in the wrong. But given that the coworker was hurt and the author didn't take into account the possibility of body image issues, the author should have been more cautious. The key here is about empathy and sensitivity to others' potential insecurities, especially in a workplace environment where such issues can be particularly delicate.\n\nTherefore, I think the correct answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because, even with good intentions, the act of drawing someone's body type in a gift without knowing their comfort level with that representation can lead to hurt feelings. The author should have anticipated that this could be an issue and perhaps chosen a different approach to the gift.\n"
