I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author made a Secret Santa gift for a coworker, an overweight girl. They drew her as she is, with her actual body type, which they say is similar to the body types in Steven Universe, which are more rounded but not unflattering. The coworker reacted badly, crying in the bathroom because she felt the drawing made her feel fat. Now the author is confused because they thought it was cute and put effort into making a personalized gift. Their coworkers are calling them an asshole for drawing her as overweight. The author is hurt and wants to know if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The coworker didn't know each other very well. The author tried to personalize the gift based on what they knew\u2014she's a cat person. Drawing her body type accurately might have been intended as a compliment, but the recipient felt offended. The author's intention was positive, but the outcome was negative for the recipient. \n\nBody image is a sensitive topic. Even if the author didn't mean any harm, the recipient's reaction is valid. The key here is whether the author should have considered that their portrayal might be hurtful. Even if the drawing is accurate, it's possible that the recipient is self-conscious about her weight. The author might not have realized that, especially if they don't know the person very well. \n\nThe coworker's emotional response (crying) indicates that the gift caused significant distress. The author's coworkers are also criticizing them, which adds to the situation. The question is whether the author had a responsibility to avoid drawing the recipient as she is, especially if they knew she might be sensitive about her weight. \n\nOn one hand, the author tried to be thoughtful by making a personalized gift. On the other hand, they might not have considered the recipient's feelings about their body. The author's defense is that it was drawn in a cute, stylized way, but if that still made the recipient feel bad, then maybe the author should have chosen a different approach. \n\nIn public forums like r/AmITheAsshole, the community often considers both intent and impact. Even if the intent was good, the impact on the recipient matters. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider that their portrayal could be hurtful. However, it's also possible that the recipient overreacted, but that's not for the author to decide. The fact that the author's coworkers are calling them an asshole suggests that there's a social expectation here to avoid body-related comments or depictions that could be hurtful, especially in a workplace setting.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A\u2014the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the recipient's potential sensitivity about their body, leading to emotional harm. However, it's a nuanced situation where the author's intentions were good, but the outcome was negative.\n"
