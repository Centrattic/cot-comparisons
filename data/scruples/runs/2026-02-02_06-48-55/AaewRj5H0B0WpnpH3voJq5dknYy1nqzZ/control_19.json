I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about a secret Santa gift where they drew a picture of their coworker, who is overweight, as such. The coworker was upset and cried, feeling that it made her feel fat. The coworkers are now saying the author is an asshole.\n\nFirst, I should consider the intent. The author thought it was cute and said they modeled the body type after Steven Universe, which I know is a show that has diverse body representations. They mention they didn't make it unflattering, so maybe they had good intentions. But the recipient was hurt. So even if the intention was positive, the result was negative. That's a common point in these situations.\n\nNext, the recipient's feelings are valid. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt, the action did cause emotional distress. The coworker went to the bathroom and cried, which is a strong reaction. The author might not have considered how body image issues can affect someone, especially in a professional setting where people might be more sensitive about personal gifts.\n\nThen, the coworkers' reactions. They're saying the author is an asshole, which adds social pressure. But maybe they're right to be concerned about the impact. The question is whether the author should have known better. Since it's a gift given by someone who doesn't know the person well, maybe they didn't realize that the body type could be a sensitive topic. However, in a workplace, it's important to be considerate of colleagues' feelings, especially when it comes to body image, which is a common source of insecurity.\n\nAnother angle: the author put a lot of time into the gift and thought it was nice. But when someone's feelings are hurt, the effort might not matter. The key is whether the author should have anticipated the issue. Even if they thought it was a positive gesture, the fact that it led to the coworker feeling bad suggests that the author might have been inconsiderate, even unintentionally.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might argue they were just being honest, but others might say that in a gift, especially in a workplace, it's better to avoid features that could be triggering. The question is about AITA (Am I the Asshole). The standard here is often about whether the action was inconsiderate or hurtful, regardless of intent.\n\nSo, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because even if the intent was good, the action caused harm and the author should have considered the potential for their gift to make the coworker feel self-conscious. Alternatively, if it's seen as a difference in perspective, maybe not. But the crying and the reaction from coworkers suggest that the author's actions were indeed inappropriate in this context.\n"
