I don't know my giftee that well, but I knew she was a big cat person so I drew her on shrinking paper holding her cat and shrunk it down into an ornament. Now my giftee is a rather large girl and I drew her body type to represent that.. nothing super unflattering kinda like a Steven Universe body type. I thought it turned out really cute, and was excited to give it to her. \n\nWell we exchanged gifts last night and she seemed less than thrilled with it, I later find out she went to the bathroom and cried because \"I made her feel fat\" and now my coworkers are telling me I am an asshole for drawing her as over weight. Honestly I am a bit hurt myself because I put a lot of time into her gift and thought it was nice. Should I have drawn her as thin even if she is not? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who drew an overweight coworker as such in a Secret Santa ornament is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author made a gift based on the recipient's interests (big cat person) and used shrinking paper. The key point is that they depicted the coworker's actual body type, which is larger. They mention it's similar to Steven Universe's body diversity, which is usually seen as positive. However, the recipient was upset and cried, feeling it made her feel fat. Coworkers now think the author is an asshole.\n\nNow, thinking about the possible angles. On one hand, the author didn't intend to be offensive; they thought it was cute and respectful. They put effort into the gift. On the other hand, body image is a sensitive topic. Even if the artist meant to be inclusive, the recipient's reaction is a key factor. The question is whether the author should have known better, even if they didn't intend harm.\n\nIn discussions about body positivity, people with larger bodies often face stigma. Even a well-meaning depiction can trigger negative feelings if the person is already self-conscious. The author might not have realized the emotional impact. However, when someone is upset, it's important to acknowledge their feelings, even if the intent was good. The coworkers' reactions also matter; their judgment could influence the perception here.\n\nIs it the author's fault for not foreseeing that? It's a tricky line. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to represent the person as they are, but they should consider that different people have different sensitivities. So, while the intention was good, the result caused harm, which could mean they're at least partially responsible. But the answer depends on whether the act itself was wrong regardless of the outcome. \n\nIn similar situations, often the person's feelings are prioritized. So even if the artist didn't mean to, causing someone to feel bad can be a mistake. The answer might lean towards A (Yes, in the wrong) because the recipient's experience is valid, and the artist should have considered potential sensitivities. But there's also a counterargument that they were honest and the recipient overreacted. However, in social dynamics, the impact is what matters. Hence, the answer is likely A.\n"
