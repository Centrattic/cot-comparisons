Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 26-year-old woman, broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual. He mentioned he had hooked up with guys before, but she didn't care about his sexuality per se. The problem seems to be that their relationship wasn't as physically intimate as she expected. They had sex once a week, she usually initiated, and she started wondering if he was using her to hide being gay. She ended up breaking up, but later admitted it was actually because of his bisexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend came out to her. He was honest, even though it made him nervous. The author says she's okay with people being gay or bi, but this is her first time dating someone who isn't straight. She felt taken aback and then started doubting their relationship dynamics. She broke up, but lied about the reason. The question is whether she was in the wrong.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The boyfriend did communicate his sexuality upfront. The author's reaction might stem from her own insecurities or expectations. She mentions they don't have sex often and she usually initiates. Maybe she felt insecure about his lack of initiative, which could be leading her to question his attraction. However, the fact that she ended the relationship because of his bisexuality, even if she didn't fully admit it, is a problem.\n\nBisexuality isn't a reason to end a relationship unless it's incompatible with the terms of the relationship. Since they were monogamous before, and he didn't mention any desire for a non-monogamous relationship, his sexuality alone shouldn't be the issue. The author's problem seems to be her own feelings of uncertainty and lack of physical connection, which might have been issues even if he was straight. She didn't address those concerns directly with him. Instead, she broke up and lied, which might be seen as avoiding the real issues.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because she ended the relationship over his sexuality, even if it wasn't the only factor. It's possible that her insecurities and unmet expectations about the relationship's physical aspect were the real issues. She didn't confront those with him, leading to a breakup based on his identity rather than their relationship's dynamics. Therefore, the answer might be A, yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
