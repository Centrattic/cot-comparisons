Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. The scenario is from the AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit, so they're looking for community judgment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend confessed he's bi and had hooked up with guys before. The author is 24, male, and the ex is 26, female. The author is straight and had never dated a non-straight person before. She's not opposed to bisexuality but felt uncomfortable and started doubting his attraction to her. She ended the relationship and later admitted he was right about his bisexuality being the real reason.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The boyfriend came out as bi, which is a personal matter. The author's decision to break up is based on his sexuality, which is a personal choice. However, if the author realized that her true issue was his bisexuality, then she might be in the wrong for not being honest and for ending the relationship for a reason that's not about his actions but his identity.\n\nBut wait, people have different deal-breakers. If the author wasn't comfortable with a bisexual partner, even if she says she's accepting, maybe it's her own values or preferences that led to the breakup. It's not about him being unfaithful or dishonest. He came out to her. The problem is her own discomfort with his sexuality.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of honesty. She told him the breakup was due to her personal issues, but the real reason was his sexuality. This deception could be a factor. But the main question is whether the reason for the breakup is valid. Since bisexuality is about attraction to both genders, and he's not in a polyamorous relationship or being unfaithful, the author's reason for breaking up is based on his identity, not his behavior. \n\nIn relationships, people have different boundaries. If someone can't accept their partner's sexuality, even if it's not affecting the relationship (no cheating, etc.), then they might have to end it. But that's their choice. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. The community usually looks at intent. If the author is breaking up because of his identity, which isn't harmful, then some might say she's not in the wrong because it's her personal choice. Others might say she's using his identity as an excuse when the real issue is lack of chemistry or other factors. But in this case, the author admits that his sexuality was the real reason. So, if someone can't accept their partner's sexuality, even if it's not causing actual harm, it's their own choice, but they might be seen as the asshole for not being fully accepting.\n\nBut wait, the user says they don't care about a person's orientation and that people should find happiness. However, she's still not comfortable. It's possible she's projecting her own discomfort onto him. The boyfriend didn't do anything wrong; he just shared his identity. The author's breakup is based on a personal conflict she's not fully ready for. In that case, the author is in the wrong because she's ending the relationship for reasons that are her own and not about his actions. The boyfriend was honest and open, and the author can't accept that. So, the answer would be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she's using his sexuality as a reason to end the relationship without valid cause beyond her own discomfort.\n"
