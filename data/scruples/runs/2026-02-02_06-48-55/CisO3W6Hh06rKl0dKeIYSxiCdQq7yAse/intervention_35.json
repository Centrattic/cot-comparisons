Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that she broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend comes out as bisexual after two years of dating. He mentions he hooked up with guys before her. The author says she doesn't care about his sexuality but isn't used to dating someone not straight. After the conversation, she starts doubting if he's even attracted to her, since their sex life is low and she usually initiates. She then breaks up with him, lying about the reason.\n\nThe key points here are about the validity of her reasons for breaking up. The question is whether she's in the wrong. So, from a relationship standpoint, honesty is important. He was honest about his sexuality, which she claims she's okay with. But she couldn't get past it and ended the relationship. \n\nBisexuality is a valid sexual orientation. If she's okay with people being gay or bi, then his orientation shouldn't be the issue. However, her personal experience with dating only straight guys might make her uncomfortable. But she's the one who ended the relationship because of his sexuality, even if she didn't admit it. \n\nAlso, she lied about the reason for the breakup. He thinks it was because of his bisexuality, she says it's personal stuff. That could add to the problem. If she wasn't comfortable with his orientation, she should have been honest. By lying, she might be avoiding taking responsibility for her feelings.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of whether she's allowed to have those feelings. People have different preferences, and it's okay to realize a relationship isn't working for personal reasons. However, if she knew she couldn't accept his bisexuality, maybe it's her own issue rather than his. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to be on the same page. If she couldn't accept his orientation, then breaking up might be the right choice, but she should be honest about it. However, if she's making a big deal out of something she said she's okay with, then she's in the wrong. \n\nThe fact that she didn't care about his sexuality but couldn't get past it suggests that her feelings were more about her own insecurities or expectations. Maybe she needed to confront her own feelings rather than blame him. But since he was honest, and she ended the relationship, maybe she's not in the wrong for ending it if it's not working for her. \n\nBut the community might see it as her being in the wrong because she ended the relationship based on his sexuality, even if she claims she's okay with it. The fact that she lied about the reason complicates things. If he had to confess and she couldn't handle it, maybe she should have been honest earlier instead of breaking up after the fact. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer depends on whether the break-up was justified. If she's not okay with bisexuality despite her claims, then she's in the wrong. If it's her personal choice to end the relationship because it's not working for her, then maybe not. But the deception in the breakup might tip the scales. I think the general consensus would be that she's in the wrong because she ended the relationship based on his sexuality, even if she didn't admit it, and lied about the reason. So answer A.\n"
