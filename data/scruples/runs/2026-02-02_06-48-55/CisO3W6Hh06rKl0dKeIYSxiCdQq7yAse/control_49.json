Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that she broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual and had previously hooked up with guys. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The boyfriend came out as bisexual and admitted to past hookups with men. The woman says she doesn't care about his orientation, but she's never dated a non-straight person before. She was taken aback but claims she's accepting. However, after the confession, she started doubting his attraction to her and broke up, lying about the real reason.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and mutual respect. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality before they were in a relationship? Wait, no, he told her during their two-year relationship. So he didn't come out to her before they were together. But that's not uncommon\u2014people can come out at any time. The issue is whether her reaction was justified.\n\nShe mentions that their sex life wasn't frequent, she usually initiates, and she felt he wasn't attracted to her. Maybe she had lingering doubts even before he came out. But when he told her about his bisexuality and past hookups, it made her question his true feelings. So she broke up but lied about the reason.\n\nIs she wrong? Well, in a relationship, it's important that both partners are comfortable with each other's orientation. If someone isn't comfortable with their partner being bisexual or gay, that's a personal issue, but choosing to end the relationship because of that is a personal choice. However, the problem here might be that she didn't address her own insecurities or discuss them openly. Instead, she broke up and lied about the reason, which could be seen as dishonest.\n\nOn the other hand, if she genuinely couldn't accept his bisexuality, even though she claims she's accepting, then she's being hypocritical. But if her issue was more about his past hookups rather than his current feelings, maybe that's a different angle. But since she broke up because of his disclosure, it seems like the bisexuality was the main issue for her.\n\nAnother angle: he was honest. She might have had underlying issues about attraction before his disclosure. But after he told her, it made her question things. She could have talked to him about her feelings instead of breaking up. However, it's also valid for her to realize she's not comfortable with his orientation even if she initially thought she was okay with it.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the community often considers if the person acted with bad intent. If she broke up because she couldn't accept his bisexuality, then technically, she's not wrong unless she had other issues. But lying about the reason might be considered dishonest. However, the main question is whether she was wrong for breaking up due to his sexuality.\n\nIn many AITA cases, people aren't in the wrong if their actions are based on their own boundaries, even if others disagree. So if she felt uncomfortable with his bisexuality, breaking up isn't inherently wrong. However, the lie might be a point against her. But the main question is about being in the wrong for breaking up. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because people have the right to set boundaries, even if others disagree. But some might argue she should have been more honest.\n"
