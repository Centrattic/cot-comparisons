Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. The story says that the girlfriend found out he was bisexual, which made her uncomfortable even though she claims she doesn't judge people for their sexuality. They had been together for two years, and she ended the relationship mainly because of his bisexuality, even though she tried to blame it on personal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality. He didn't hide it; he came out to her. The girlfriend, while accepting of different sexual orientations in general, felt uneasy because he had hooked up with guys before. She started doubting his attraction to her and decided to break up. \n\nNow, the question is whether she was wrong to do so. In terms of right and wrong, it's a bit subjective. However, there are some factors to consider. The boyfriend didn't do anything deceptive. He was upfront, which is important in a relationship. The issue here is the girlfriend's personal discomfort with his bisexuality. If her decision to break up was based solely on his sexual orientation, which he disclosed honestly, then she might be at fault. \n\nBut wait, she also mentions that their sexual frequency was low and she initiated it. Maybe her insecurity was compounded by other factors, but the main reason she gives for the breakup is his bisexuality. If she can't accept that aspect of him, even if she claims she doesn't judge, then her actions might be seen as hypocritical. \n\nOn the other hand, people have different deal-breakers. If being with someone who is not exclusively heterosexual is a problem for her, even if it's not about judgment, she's not legally or morally obligated to stay in the relationship. But ethically, if she accepted his bisexuality but still broke up because of it, that could be considered in the wrong, especially since he was honest. \n\nThe community's view on AITA posts often leans towards the person who was honest and upfront being in the right. The person who ends the relationship over something that was disclosed truthfully might be seen as the one at fault, unless there were other issues. Here, the main issue seems to be her personal discomfort, not any betrayal or deceit from his side. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because the breakup was based on his honest disclosure of his sexuality, which he didn't hide. She had the choice to stay or leave but chose to end it for that reason, which could be seen as her issue rather than his.\n"
