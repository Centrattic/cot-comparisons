Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a 24-year-old woman) is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. The situation is that he told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author doesn't care about his sexuality but felt something was off in their relationship, like low sex frequency and lack of lust. She ended the relationship, claiming it was personal stuff but really because of his bisexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Open communication is key in relationships. The boyfriend did come out to her, which is a responsible step. The author's reasons for breaking up are based on her discomfort with his sexuality even though she claims to accept it. She mentions she's never dated a non-straight person before, so maybe she's not ready for that. \n\nNext, the ethical aspect. Is it fair to break up someone based on their sexuality when they were honest from the start? The boyfriend was upfront, so the author had the choice to stay or go. She chose to leave, which isn't inherently wrong, but the question is if she's in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning: she felt he wasn't attracted to her because of the low sex drive and lack of lust. But that could be unrelated to his sexuality. Maybe he's just not as sexually active, which is common. She might have been projecting her insecurities onto him. \n\nShe lied about the reason for the breakup, which shows she might not have been honest with him. Honesty is important, so her dishonesty could be a point against her. However, her feelings are valid. She felt uncomfortable and couldn't move past his sexuality, which is her choice, but not necessarily wrong. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, people have the right to date who they choose, and the author can't be blamed for not wanting to be in a relationship with a bisexual partner. But since he was honest, she's not at fault for breaking up, just maybe for lying about the reason. \n\nSo, the key points are: the boyfriend was honest, the author acted on her feelings, and while her dishonesty is a negative, the breakup itself isn't her fault. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she made a decision based on her comfort, even if it wasn't the healthiest approach.\n"
