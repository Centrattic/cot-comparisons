Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. The scenario is presented as an \"Am I the Asshole?\" question.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend came out as bisexual and admitted to hooking up with men before the relationship. The author states they don't have a problem with his sexuality but were taken aback because they've only dated straight guys. They ended the relationship, but the boyfriend claims it was about his bisexuality, while the author initially blamed personal issues. The author later admits that the boyfriend's sexuality was the real reason.\n\nNow, evaluating the situation. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality from the start, which is important. The author's issue isn't with bisexuality per se but with the fact that their ex had been with other men before. But the author had been in a two-year relationship without knowing this. Did the boyfriend have a responsibility to disclose his bisexuality earlier? Well, people can self-identify later in life, and if he only realized he was bi after the relationship started, maybe he wasn't aware earlier. However, if he had hooked up with men before, perhaps that should have been discussed earlier.\n\nThe author's main issue seems to be about not feeling a certain level of attraction from the boyfriend. They mention initiating sex and not feeling lust. But they didn't address this during the relationship, only after the breakup. The author's decision to break up based on the boyfriend's sexuality, even if they claim to accept it, might be problematic. They ended the relationship because they couldn't get past his bisexuality, even though they stated it's okay. That could be seen as hypocrisy or a lack of self-awareness.\n\nAlso, the author lied about the reason for the breakup, which adds layers of dishonesty. Even if they felt uncomfortable, being honest about their feelings could have led to a more transparent resolution. The boyfriend, on the other hand, was upfront about his identity, which is a positive step.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's actions led to the breakup based on a personal discomfort rather than a clear incompatibility. While everyone has the right to choose their partners, acting on personal biases without addressing them constructively could be seen as wrong. The author might not be at fault for feeling a certain way, but acting on those feelings without considering the relationship's context and the boyfriend's honesty might place some responsibility on them.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they ended the relationship based on their own unresolved feelings and biases, and they were dishonest about the real reason. The boyfriend was upfront about his identity, and the author didn't address the underlying issues in their relationship effectively.\n"
