Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. The scenario is from an \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) context, so the answer should be either A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend told the author he's bisexual and had previously hooked up with guys. The author didn't care about his sexuality but felt uncertain because they had a low sexual frequency and she felt she always initiated. She ended the relationship, lying about the real reason. The boyfriend thought he was the cause, but she actually couldn't get past his bisexuality.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The author is a woman who's been in a two-year relationship. Her issue isn't with the fact that he's bisexual, but maybe with the fact that he had past experiences with men. However, she clarifies that she doesn't care about someone's orientation. The problem arises from her uncertainty about his attraction to her and the lack of sexual intimacy, which she might be attributing to his bisexuality.\n\nIn relationships, honesty and mutual understanding are important. The boyfriend came out to her, which is a significant step. The author's reaction was based on her own insecurities rather than his actions. She broke up because she couldn't get past his past, even though she said it's okay. Lying about the reason for the breakup might add to the complexity.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, it's her prerogative to end a relationship if she's unhappy. However, the way she handled it\u2014lying and not being honest about her feelings\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. On the other hand, if she felt that his bisexuality made her question their connection, even if she doesn't condemn it, it's a personal decision. In AITA scenarios, people are often considered \"not the asshole\" if they're making a personal choice, even if it's hard to hear.\n\nThe key here is that the author's issue isn't with bisexuality itself, but with her own doubts about the relationship's dynamics. Since she's the one ending it, and the boyfriend was honest from the start, the AITA community usually sides with the person who's being honest and upfront. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily the asshole for ending the relationship, even if her reasons are a bit self-doubt based. The answer would be B (No).\n"
