Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend confessed to being bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author says she's not against bisexuality but felt conflicted because she's only dated straight guys before. She broke up with him, citing her own personal issues, but the real reason was his sexuality. She's asking if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The boyfriend came out as bisexual, which is a personal aspect of his identity. The author had a right to her feelings, but breaking up solely because of his sexuality might be problematic. However, maybe there were other factors. Let's look at the details.\n\nThe couple had been together for two years. The boyfriend's actions (hooking up with guys before) were in the past. The author mentions that their sex life was low, she usually initiated, and she started questioning if he's even attracted to her. But he compliments her appearance. She felt he might be using her to cover being gay. But the main issue was his bisexuality.\n\nThe author lied about the reason for the breakup. She denied it was because of his bisexuality and blamed it on her personal stuff. This deception could be a point against her. Also, she's conflicted about whether she should accept his identity or not, given her previous experience.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, relationships require mutual respect for each other's identities. If the author couldn't accept his bisexuality, even if she's okay with it in general, maybe it's not her fault. But if she ended the relationship for that reason, she might be in the wrong if bisexuality was not a deal-breaker for them. However, if she felt it was incompatible, maybe she's justified.\n\nBut since she lied about the reason, that could be seen as dishonest. Also, she's conflicted, which is human. However, the main question is whether she was wrong to break up over his sexuality. In many ethical frameworks, one's sexual orientation is a personal matter and shouldn't be a reason to end a relationship unless both parties agree. If the boyfriend's actions (cheating) were the issue, but he was only honest about his past, then maybe the problem was compatibility in terms of emotional connection, not just bisexuality.\n\nBut she's breaking up because he's bi, not because of cheating or current behavior. So if she can't accept his sexuality, even if he's faithful, then maybe she's not in the wrong. However, it's more complex because she's projecting her insecurities onto him. She might be using his bisexuality as an excuse for her own issues with the relationship dynamics. The key is whether his bisexuality was a direct cause for the breakup. If she's not comfortable with that aspect of him, even if he's not cheating, then it's a personal choice. But in terms of societal norms, it's considered wrong to end a relationship solely because of the other person's sexuality, especially when it's not affecting the relationship negatively. However, if she felt it's incompatible, she could be justified. The deception in the breakup might make her seem inconsiderate, but the core issue is the reason for the breakup. If the answer is about being in the wrong, the answer could be A (yes) because she's ending the relationship due to his identity, which is not her fault if she can't accept it. But the community often sides with the person upholding their boundaries. However, in this case, bisexuality isn't harmful. So maybe she's in the wrong. I think the answer is A.\n"
