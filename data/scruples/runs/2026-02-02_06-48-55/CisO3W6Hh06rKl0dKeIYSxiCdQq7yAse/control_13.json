Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a breakup after the boyfriend comes out as bisexual.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The author dated the boyfriend for two years. He told her he's bisexual and had previously hooked up with guys. She didn't care about his sexuality in general but was taken aback because she's only dated straight guys. She broke up with him, but she lied about the reason, blaming personal stuff instead of his bisexuality. She later admitted that his coming out was the real issue.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's at fault. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, she had the right to her own feelings and boundaries. If she couldn't accept that he's bisexual, even though he was honest, maybe it's not entirely her fault. People have different deal-breakers. However, she did lie about the reason for the breakup, which could be seen as dishonest. Also, she had known him for two years and had issues with the frequency of sex and lack of lust, which might have contributed to her decision. But she only broke up after he came out, which he didn't hide. \n\nIs being bisexual a reason to break up? It depends on her values. If she can't be with someone who is attracted to others, even if they're not acting on it, that's a personal choice. But she's not wrong for having those feelings. However, lying about the reason for the breakup might be considered unethical. Also, maybe she should have addressed her own insecurities or communication issues before breaking up.\n\nBut the core issue is whether she's in the wrong for ending the relationship. Since his bisexuality was a factor, and she's honest about it now, maybe she's not at fault. People can have different deal-breakers. However, the lie about the reason might be a point against her. But the main question is about the breakup itself. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if he was being honest and she couldn't accept that, it's her choice. She's not in the wrong for ending it. People can't be forced to stay in a relationship if they have personal issues. So maybe the answer is B, No, she's not in the wrong. But the lie complicates things. However, the lie is about her own feelings, not about the actual reason. So maybe the main issue is her decision to break up, which is her right. So B.\n"
