Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that she broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. She claims she's okay with bisexuality but couldn't get past it, leading to the breakup. She lied about the reason for the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend came out as bisexual and admitted past hookups with guys. The author, while accepting of others' orientations, had never dated a non-straight guy before and felt uncertain. She ended the relationship, but denied the true reason and blamed personal issues instead. \n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. Relationships require honesty and mutual compatibility. If her main issue was his bisexuality, even though she said she's accepting, then that's a problem. She might have values or needs that aren't compatible with a bisexual partner. But she should have been honest about her feelings. By lying about the breakup reason, she's not being truthful, which can hurt her ex. However, if being with someone who's bisexual isn't something she can accept, even if she says she should, then her decision to leave might be justified from her perspective. \n\nBut is it her fault? If she's not ready to be in a relationship with a bisexual partner, she's not wrong for leaving, but she was wrong to lie about the reason. The AITA often hinges on intentions and honesty. The fact that she lied to protect her feelings might not make her the \"wrong\" one, but the question is whether she's in the wrong for breaking up due to his sexuality. Since she stated she doesn't care about others' orientation but had issues in practice, that inconsistency might make her the wrong one. Alternatively, if she's not in a position to be in a relationship with a non-straight partner, then her choice is valid. However, the core issue is her lack of honesty during the breakup. \n\nIn AITA contexts, being dishonest about the reasons for a breakup can lead to the person being in the wrong. So even if her feelings are valid, lying about the cause might tip the balance. So maybe answer A (yes, she's in the wrong) because of dishonesty and possibly acting on insecurities rather than clear incompatibility.\n"
