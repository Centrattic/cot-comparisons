Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for breaking up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author says she doesn't care about his sexuality but was taken aback because she's only dated straight guys before. She then started feeling insecure about their sex life\u2014low frequency, her initiating, not feeling enough lust. Eventually, she broke up with him but lied about the reason.\n\nNow, the question is if she's in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. \n\n1. **Disclosure of Sexuality**: The boyfriend came out as bisexual. Some might argue that his sexuality isn't a valid reason to break up. However, if the author wasn't comfortable with his bisexuality, maybe she should have considered that before entering the relationship. But others might say that coming out isn't a betrayal, and it's the other person's truth.\n\n2. **Reasons for the Breakup**: The author admits the breakup was because of his bisexuality but lied about it. She felt insecure about the sex life, wondering if he's not attracted to her. However, the frequency of sex and initiation can vary in relationships and don't necessarily indicate a lack of attraction. Her insecurity might be her own issue rather than his.\n\n3. **Communication**: Did she address her insecurities? It seems she didn't. She broke up instead of talking about her feelings. Open communication is important in relationships. If she couldn't handle his bisexuality, maybe she should have discussed it rather than ending things abruptly.\n\n4. **Honesty in Breakup**: She lied about the reasons for the breakup. Honesty is crucial in such situations. Her lie might have caused unnecessary hurt and confusion for him.\n\n5. **Valid Reasons for Breakup**: If the problem was his bisexuality, then it's a personal choice. But if she's using that as an excuse for her own insecurities (sex frequency, lack of lust), then maybe she's projecting. However, her discomfort with his past actions is valid if it affected her trust or emotional state.\n\n6. **Context of Their Relationship**: The relationship had been two years. If she had never dated a non-straight person before, maybe this was a cultural or personal belief she hadn't addressed. She might have realized this wasn't compatible for her. But coming out as bisexual isn't a deal-breaker for everyone, and the breakup might be her way of coping with insecurities she hadn't resolved.\n\nConsidering all this, the key factors are whether bisexuality is a valid reason to break up and if the author acted inconsiderately. While the author's actions might stem from personal issues (insecurities about sex and attraction), lying about the reason for the breakup and not communicating properly could make her at fault. However, if she genuinely couldn't accept his sexuality despite her initial stance, then it's a personal choice. But given that she admitted she's not in a position to judge and the breakup was more about her insecurities than his sexuality, she might be at fault for not handling it better. Also, the lie about the reason could be seen as dishonest, adding to her being in the wrong.\n"
