Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual. The key points from her story are:\n\n1. The boyfriend is 24, she's 26. They were together for two years.\n2. He confessed he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. She says she doesn't care about people's orientation, but she's never dated a non-straight person before.\n3. She felt taken aback and started questioning their relationship's issues, like infrequent sex and her initiating it. She blames his bisexuality for not feeling desired.\n4. She breaks up with him, lying about the real reason to avoid hurting his feelings, but admits it's because of his sexuality.\n\nNow, the main question is whether she was wrong to break up. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, from a moral standpoint, people have the right to their own boundaries and comfort in relationships. If she's uncomfortable with her partner's bisexuality, even if she claims not to have an issue with it, that's her personal choice. However, if she's breaking up solely because he's bisexual and not because of any other issues, that's where the problem might lie. The fact that she's lying about the reason suggests she might feel guilty or that her reasons aren't justified. \n\nBut in a relationship, honesty is key. If one partner's sexual orientation is a deal-breaker for the other, there's no inherent moral wrong in choosing to leave. However, if she's making assumptions about his feelings or attractions based on his orientation (like thinking he's using her to cover being gay), that's where her judgment might be unfounded. The boyfriend admitted to past hookups but didn't necessarily indicate any issues in the current relationship. \n\nAlso, the frequency of their sex and her initiating it might be separate from his bisexuality. She's conflating his identity with her own insecurities or issues in the relationship. If she didn't have those problems before he came out, then maybe the break-up is based on his orientation. But if his bisexuality is exacerbating existing issues, then it's a valid reason. \n\nFrom a societal perspective, some might argue that she's being judgmental, especially given her age and the time in the relationship. Others might say that everyone has different deal-breakers and she's within her right to end things if she can't accept his bisexuality, even if she claims to support it. \n\nBut the fact that she's lying about the reason to protect his feelings might indicate she's aware that her actions could be seen as wrong. However, her right to her own feelings and boundaries is important. \n\nIn summary, the author is breaking up because of her partner's sexual orientation, which is her personal choice. However, if her decision is based on assumptions about his sexuality affecting their relationship rather than actual behavior issues, that could be problematic. Since the question is about being in the wrong, morally, if she's acting on her own values and boundaries without malicious intent, she's not necessarily in the wrong. But if the break-up is solely based on his orientation without other valid reasons, some might see it as judgmental. The answer might hinge on whether the break-up is justified by the actual issues in the relationship or solely his bisexuality.\n"
