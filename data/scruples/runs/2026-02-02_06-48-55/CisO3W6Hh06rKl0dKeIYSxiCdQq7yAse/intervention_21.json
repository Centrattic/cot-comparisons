Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple was together for two years. The boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author says she doesn't care about his sexuality but wasn't used to dating someone who wasn't straight. She felt uneasy and started doubting his attraction to her, leading her to break up, even though she admitted it was because of his bisexuality, even though she claimed it wasn't the reason.\n\nNow, the key points here. The boyfriend disclosed his bisexuality, which the author wasn't expecting. She broke up, but later admitted that was the real reason. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nI should consider consent and honesty. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which the author found unsettling. The author's reaction might stem from discomfort with his past or her own expectations. But in a relationship, both parties need to feel comfortable with each other's orientation and past. If the author couldn't accept that her partner was bi, even if she said she didn't care, maybe the breakup was her way of dealing with her own feelings. \n\nBut is it fair to break up solely because of his bisexuality? If she said she doesn't care about his orientation, but her actions contradict that, maybe she's in the wrong for not being honest with herself and him. Also, he came out to her, showing trust, and she ended it, which could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nHowever, relationships are about mutual compatibility. If she couldn't accept his bisexuality despite her initial statements, maybe it's not her fault entirely. It's possible she had unresolved issues or insecurities. But the fact that she lied about the reason for the breakup and later admitted the truth suggests she's avoiding responsibility. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because she ended the relationship not because of his bisexuality itself but because of her inability to accept it, even if she claimed she didn't care. The boyfriend's honesty isn't the issue; the issue is her reaction. Since she couldn't handle his bisexuality, which he had the right to disclose, she might be in the wrong for not being able to move past her discomfort.\n"
