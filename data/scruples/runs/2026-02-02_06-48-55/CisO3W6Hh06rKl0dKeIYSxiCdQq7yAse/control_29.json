Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. So, the person is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up with their boyfriend after he told them he's bisexual. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend came out as bisexual. The author mentions they don't care about someone's sexual orientation, but this was a surprise to them since they've only dated straight guys. The boyfriend admitted to hooking up with guys before. The author then started questioning their relationship, thinking maybe he's gay and using her to cover it up. They also mention that their sex life isn't very active, with the author usually initiating. They broke up, but the boyfriend thought it was because of his bisexuality, while the author blamed personal issues. The author later admits the bisexuality was a key factor.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is that the author ended the relationship because they couldn't accept the boyfriend's bisexuality. The boyfriend was honest about his identity. The author's reasoning seems to be based more on uncertainty and possibly their own discomfort with the situation rather than the boyfriend's actions violating any boundaries or causing harm. \n\nBisexuality is a valid sexual orientation, and being in a monogamous relationship doesn't negate that. If the author had agreed to a monogamous relationship, the boyfriend's past actions might not be relevant. However, the author's reaction was based on their personal discomfort and perhaps misconceptions. \n\nThe key point is whether the author's reason for breaking up was justified. Since the boyfriend didn't hide his sexuality and was upfront, the author's decision to end the relationship might be seen as their own insecurity rather than the boyfriend's wrongdoing. Relationships require mutual acceptance, and if the author couldn't accept his orientation after he was honest, then it's a personal choice. However, lying about the reason for the breakup might make the author look dishonest, but not necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship itself.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for breaking up due to personal reasons, but their dishonesty about the breakup reason complicates things. However, the main question is about being in the wrong for the breakup. Since the boyfriend was honest and the author had personal issues accepting it, the answer might be B (No). But I need to make sure. \n\nAnother angle: if the author was in a committed relationship and couldn't accept the partner's identity, which is a core part of who he is, then the breakup is more about the author's inability to accept it, which isn't the partner's fault. So, the author isn't in the wrong for breaking up, but might be in the wrong for lying about the reason. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the breakup itself. Since the partner disclosed his orientation honestly, the author's decision is their own choice, not the partner's fault. So answer B.\n"
