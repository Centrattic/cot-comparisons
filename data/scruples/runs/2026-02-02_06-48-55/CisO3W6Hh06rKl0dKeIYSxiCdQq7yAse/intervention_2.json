Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for breaking up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The boyfriend came out as bi and admitted to hooking up with guys before. The author says they don't care about his orientation but had never dated a non-straight person before. The break-up happened because the author felt maybe he wasn't attracted to her and was using her to cover being gay. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the boyfriend was honest about his bisexuality and past relationships with men. The author broke up because they felt uncomfortable or uncertain about the relationship after that disclosure. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, honesty is important. The boyfriend was upfront. The author's issue seems to be about discomfort with his sexuality and possible insecurities about the relationship's nature. They admitted it's not about his orientation per se but about their own feelings and doubts after learning this.\n\nThe author lied about the reason for the break-up, which might add to the problem. Honesty in break-ups is usually considered better. However, the core issue is whether the break-up itself was justified. If the author couldn't accept his bisexuality or had insecurities that made them unhappy, maybe it's not the boyfriend's fault. But the problem is the author's reaction, not the boyfriend's identity.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. Being in a relationship with someone of a different sexual orientation isn't a valid reason to break up if the author is fine with it. But in this case, the author had doubts and couldn't move past the disclosure. The fact that the author lied about the reason might make them question their own motives, but the main issue is their inability to accept the situation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the break-up was because of the boyfriend's sexuality, then maybe. However, the author's reasoning might be that they felt the relationship wasn't working, and the disclosure made them see that. But the underlying issue is their own insecurities and past experiences. \n\nIn many cases, people are allowed to have different boundaries. If the author's issue is not about his orientation per se but about the behavior (like not having sex enough), maybe it's not about bisexuality but other factors. But the author tied it to his sexuality. So the answer could be A, the author is in the wrong because they broke up due to his sexuality, which isn't a valid reason if they claim not to care. Alternatively, if they found out he was hiding something, but he was honest. \n\nHmm. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they broke up due to his sexuality despite saying they don't care, and their insecurities shouldn't be his responsibility. However, the situation is complex. But the user's own thought is they think the author is wrong, so the answer might agree with that.\n"
