Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with their boyfriend after he confessed to being bisexual. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author states she doesn't care about his sexuality but is uncomfortable because they haven't been having sex much, and she's wondering if he's even attracted to her. She then breaks up with him, but blames it on her own issues instead of his sexuality. She admits that if he hadn't come out as bi, they'd still be together, so she feels guilty.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me think about the key points here. The boyfriend disclosed his bisexuality, which the author didn't anticipate. She says she's accepting of other people's orientations but had only dated straight guys before. This is a new situation for her, causing her anxiety. Her main issues seem to be about not having sex often and feeling unattracted, which she links to his sexuality. But is that a valid reason to break up?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. When a partner comes out, it's important to discuss how that affects the relationship. If the author felt uncomfortable, maybe she should have talked about her feelings directly instead of letting them build up. By hiding the real reason for the breakup, she might have avoided a tough conversation. \n\nAlso, bisexuality doesn't inherently mean he's not attracted to her. The low sex frequency could be due to other factors like stress, lifestyle, or even a mismatch in needs. The author's assumption that his bisexuality is the root cause might not be fair. She's making a judgment based on his sexuality rather than addressing the actual issues in their relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, it's okay for someone to feel that a partner's sexuality affects their comfort. If she realized that being in a relationship with a bisexual partner made her anxious, maybe it's a personal compatibility issue. However, breaking up because of something that doesn't directly impact the relationship's functionality (like his past hookups with men) could be seen as unfair, especially if she's okay with his sexuality in theory but not in practice.\n\nBut wait, the author says she's okay with others' orientations, but this is her own situation. People can have valid reasons for discomfort even if they're accepting. The problem is whether her reaction is justified. If she's not attracted to him, maybe that's a separate issue from his sexuality. She might need to address her own feelings of attraction rather than attributing them to his bisexuality. \n\nAlso, the fact that she lied about the breakup reason complicates things. Being honest with a partner is important. By not being truthful, she might have caused him unnecessary distress and not given them a chance to work through her concerns. \n\nIn summary, while the author's feelings are valid, her decision to break up because of his bisexuality, without addressing the underlying issues like attraction and communication, might be seen as her being in the wrong. She could have had an honest conversation about her feelings instead of letting them lead to a breakup. So I think the answer is A.\n"
