Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend told the author he's bisexual and admitted to hooking up with guys before. The author doesn't care about bisexuality in general but felt uneasy because she's only dated straight guys before. The relationship had other issues: infrequent sex, usually initiated by her, and she started doubting his attraction to her. She broke up, claiming it was personal issues but later admitted it was because of his sexuality.\n\nSo, the key points are: 1) The author ended the relationship because of his bisexuality. 2) He was honest about it first. 3) The author had pre-existing doubts about their sex life and his attraction. \n\nNow, considering if she's in the wrong. The boyfriend came out upfront. The author admitted her issue wasn't with bisexuality per se but with the fact that he had past relationships with men. She felt she couldn't move past that, leading to the breakup. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important, and he was truthful. However, the author's decision to end it based on his sexuality might be seen as her issue, not his. But if she can't accept his orientation despite not being against it, maybe she is in the wrong. Also, she lied about the reason for the breakup, which adds to the complexity. \n\nBut some might argue that if you can't accept a partner's sexuality after they come clean, it's valid to end things. The question is whether the problem was his bisexuality or the fact that he had past relationships. If the issue is his past actions, maybe that's a different matter. However, since the author said she doesn't mind others' sexuality, her reaction seems hypocritical. \n\nOn the other hand, if the main issue was her uncertainty about his attraction due to their sex life, which existed before he came out, then maybe the breakup was influenced by other factors. But she admitted the bisexuality was the actual reason. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to break up because of his sexuality, despite his honesty, might be seen as her not being ready for a relationship with a bisexual partner. Since he was upfront, and she knew this before committing, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if the problem was his bisexuality itself, then she might be in the wrong. However, the author clarified she doesn't care about others' sexuality, so the issue might be more about her own insecurities rather than his sexuality. Therefore, the answer could be that she's not in the wrong because breaking up over personal reasons, even if it's about a partner's sexuality, is a personal choice. But since the boyfriend was honest and there were other underlying issues, it's more complicated. Hmm. I think the correct answer is B (No), because the author's decision is based on her own inability to accept his past actions related to his sexuality, even if she claims not to care. Since she couldn't accept it, it's her choice, but in the context of AITA, maybe not in the wrong. Alternatively, if the problem was his bisexuality itself, then A. Need to decide based on the scenario.\n"
