Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is at fault. The scenario is from the AITA (Am I the Asshole) subreddit, so it's a real-life situation presented by someone seeking opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend came out as bisexual after two years, admitting he had hooked up with guys before. The author says they don't care about his sexuality in general, but this revelation made them uncomfortable. They mention that their relationship wasn't very sexual, with the author usually initiating, and they started doubting if he was even attracted to them. The breakup was framed as due to the author's personal issues, but they admit it's because of his bisexuality.\n\nNow, I need to consider the ethics here. Bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation, and coming out should be respected. However, the author is conflicted because they haven't dated non-straight men before. The issue is whether breaking up over this is the author's fault.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they couldn't get past his bisexuality, even though they claim to accept others' orientations. The boyfriend didn't do anything wrong by being honest. The author's decision to end the relationship based on his sexuality might be seen as discriminatory. However, people have different comfort levels, and the author might not be at fault if they're not ready for a relationship with a bisexual partner.\n\nBut wait, the author had a two-year relationship. If the issue is that the boyfriend is bisexual and the author isn't comfortable with that, then the author is within their rights to end the relationship. However, if the author is making assumptions or letting stereotypes influence their decision, that could be problematic. The author is also projecting their insecurities onto the boyfriend, like questioning his attraction to them, which might stem from their discomfort with his bisexuality.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the boyfriend was honest. The author made a choice based on their own feelings. While it's not right to be discriminatory, if the author genuinely can't make the relationship work because of the partner's orientation, that's a personal choice. However, in a healthy relationship, both partners should be comfortable and accepting of each other's identities. If the author's discomfort is leading to the breakup, it's a personal decision but not necessarily the author's fault if they're not ready. However, if it's based on prejudice, then they might be at fault.\n\nThe key here is whether the breakup is based on prejudice against bisexuality. The author says they don't care, but their actions suggest otherwise. However, they're not being intentionally discriminatory; they're just not comfortable. It's a complex issue. The answer likely leans towards not in the wrong because the author has the right to their feelings, but some might argue they should work through it. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The answer might be A (Yes) if the author is being discriminatory, or B (No) if it's a personal choice despite not being comfortable.\n"
