Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with her boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend came out to her. That's a big step, and he was honest about his past. The user says she's not against bisexuality in general, but she's never dated a non-straight guy before. She felt taken aback and then started doubting the relationship. \n\nShe mentions that their sex life is infrequent and she usually initiates. She started wondering if he was using her to cover up being gay. That sounds like insecurity or maybe a lack of connection in the relationship. Then she broke up with him, but lied about the reason. \n\nSo, the question is whether she's at fault. Well, the boyfriend was upfront, and she had the choice to stay or leave. She chose to leave because she couldn't get past his bisexuality, even though she said she didn't care. That might reflect more on her own feelings and readiness for a relationship with a bisexual partner rather than his actions. \n\nIs she wrong? It depends. If she felt uncomfortable with his sexuality affecting their relationship, then maybe it's not entirely her fault. But since he was honest and she decided to leave, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, lying about the breakup reason could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut in the \"Am I the Asshole\" context, people often judge based on whether the person acted unfairly. Since the boyfriend was truthful and she had the choice, she's not necessarily in the wrong for leaving. But the issue is her dishonesty and possible inconsiderate reasoning. However, the community might say no because she had her reasons and he was honest. So, answer B.\n"
