Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is at fault. The scenario is that the boyfriend revealed he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author then broke up, but admitted it was because of his sexuality, even though they told him it was about their personal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend came out as bisexual, which the author says they don't have a problem with in general. However, the author realized they were in a relationship with a man who isn't exclusively straight, which made them uncomfortable. The author ended the relationship, but lied about the reason, which adds a layer of dishonesty.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, people have the right to their own comfort in relationships. If the author can't be in a relationship with someone who is bisexual, even if they claim they don't judge, then maybe it's valid for them to end the relationship. However, the fact that they lied about the reason could indicate they were avoiding confrontation or not being honest about their true feelings, which might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut also, the boyfriend had already engaged in relationships with men before the author. The author might feel that they were not given the full picture from the start. However, the boyfriend did come clean, which is responsible. The author's issue is more about their own feelings rather than something the boyfriend did wrong. \n\nIn relationships, compatibility is key. If someone can't accept their partner's sexuality, even if the partner is committed, it's okay for them to step back. But the author's lie about the breakup reason complicates things. They might be in the wrong for not being honest, but not necessarily for ending the relationship itself. So it's a bit of a gray area.\n\nStill, the author made a choice based on their own needs and comfort, even if it meant the relationship wouldn't work. The key here is that the author isn't being malicious, just honest with themselves, albeit dishonest with the boyfriend about the reason. The boyfriend, on the other hand, was upfront. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship, but the lie is a point against them. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong overall. Since they're allowed to have their own boundaries, even if those boundaries lead to ending the relationship, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But the lie could tip it to A. Hmm.\n"
