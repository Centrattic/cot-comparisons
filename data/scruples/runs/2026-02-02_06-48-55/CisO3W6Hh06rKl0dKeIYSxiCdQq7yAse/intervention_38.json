Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author, a 24-year-old woman, broke up with her 26-year-old boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual. He mentioned he had hooked up with guys before, which surprised her. She says she doesn't care about his sexuality in general, but she's never dated a non-straight guy before. The relationship had some issues, like infrequent sex initiated by her, leading her to question if he's even attracted to her. She ended things by blaming personal issues but admitted the real reason was his bisexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Bisexuality is a valid orientation, and someone's choice to be honest about it shouldn't be a deal-breaker unless there's a fundamental incompatibility. The author's main issue seems to be his past hookups, but she didn't care about his orientation per se. However, she was using his sexuality to justify her decision, even though she had other concerns about their sexual relationship. \n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend was honest about his sexuality early on, would she still have dated him? Since she said she's open to people being gay or bi, maybe it's her own insecurities or the fact that he's not exclusively into women that's the issue. Also, the fact that she lied about the reason for the breakup might be a factor. She didn't confront him about her feelings or discuss boundaries if he's bisexual. Maybe she should have communicated better before ending things. \n\nBut the other perspective is that if someone's core values or deal-breakers include not wanting to date someone who's bi, even if they're honest, then the author isn't wrong in choosing to end things. However, the problem here is that the boyfriend didn't hide his sexuality; he came clean. So perhaps the author is at fault for ending the relationship over something he disclosed, especially since she initially said she doesn't care about his orientation. \n\nAnother angle: the author's insecurities about the sexual aspect of the relationship might have been exacerbated by his bisexuality. But the root issue could be the lack of attraction from him, which might be separate from his orientation. If he's not into her, regardless of being bi, then maybe the breakup is justified. However, the problem is she didn't address the sexual issues directly, instead using his sexuality as a scapegoat. \n\nIs it fair to break up over bisexuality when the person is honest and the relationship had other issues? The author might not be wrong if the core issue was his bisexuality, but she might be wrong if the real issues were the sexual frequency and lack of attraction, which she didn't address properly. \n\nAlso, the fact that she lied about the reason for the breakup complicates things. If she was honest, maybe they could have worked through it or he understood. But she didn't, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong because she prioritized his bisexuality over their other issues and didn't communicate her concerns. Alternatively, if she felt uncomfortable with his orientation despite her initial acceptance, she's not wrong for ending the relationship. However, the way she handled it (lying) and using his sexuality as a reason after claiming she didn't mind could be problematic.\n"
