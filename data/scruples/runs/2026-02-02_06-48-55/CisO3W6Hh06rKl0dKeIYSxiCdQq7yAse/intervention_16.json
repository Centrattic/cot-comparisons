Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual. The boyfriend mentioned he had hooked up with guys before, which made her question if he's really gay and using her to hide it. She also mentions that they don't have sex often, and when they do, she usually initiates. She felt she couldn't get past his bisexuality, even though she claims not to care about people's sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend came out as bisexual, which is a valid sexual orientation. The author's reaction was based on her own insecurities or discomfort with his past and possible attractions. The key point is whether her decision to break up was unfair or not. \n\nBisexuality means attraction to both genders, so if he's in a monogamous relationship with her, then being bi isn't a reason for the breakup unless there's an issue with fidelity. The author didn't mention infidelity, just that he had hooked up before. But after the disclosure, she started doubting his attraction. However, she later admits that if he hadn't told her, they'd still be together, which suggests her decision was based on his sexuality rather than any actual issues like cheating. \n\nThe author lied about the reason for the breakup, which adds another layer. Her reasoning was that she couldn't get past his bisexuality, leading to paranoia. But that's her personal issue. The question is whether it's fair to break up over this. Relationships require mutual acceptance of each other's traits. If she isn't comfortable with his bisexuality, even in a monogamous context, maybe she was being dishonest about her own boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, if the relationship was already having underlying issues (like low sexual frequency), maybe the disclosure was the final straw. But the author attributes the breakup solely to his bisexuality. The boyfriend might feel he was honest and the relationship was broken over something he can't control. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if the author broke up because she couldn't accept his bisexuality, even though he's committed to her, that could be seen as being in the wrong. People should be able to love others regardless of their sexual orientation. However, if the author felt that his bisexuality made her uncomfortable in the relationship, that's a personal choice, but hiding the real reason might be the issue. \n\nSo, the answer seems to be that the author is in the wrong because her breakup was based on his sexuality, which is not a valid reason if the relationship was otherwise healthy. She should have communicated her feelings honestly instead of lying and ending it. Therefore, AITA (Am I the Asshole) would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
