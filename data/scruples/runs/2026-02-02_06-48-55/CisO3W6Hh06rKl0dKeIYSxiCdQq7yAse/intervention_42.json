Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who broke up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. I need to think about the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author says she doesn't care about people's sexuality and that she's happy for them. But she's never dated a non-straight person before, so this was new for her. She felt taken aback and started questioning if he was using her to hide his true orientation. She ended up breaking up with him, but she admitted that the real reason was his bisexuality, even though she told him it was her personal issues. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, relationships are about mutual understanding and compatibility. If someone can't be okay with their partner's sexuality, even if it's not about the sexuality itself but about their own feelings or insecurities, then maybe the break-up is their choice. But was it fair? The boyfriend came out to her, which is a big step. She claims she's non-judgmental but admitted she couldn't get past it. Maybe she didn't handle it well by lying about the reason for the breakup. However, her feelings are valid\u2014she felt insecure and couldn't move past it. \n\nBut the key point is whether she's in the wrong. If she's honest, she's not in the wrong for choosing to end a relationship where she felt insecure. However, lying about the reason might have been hurtful. But the question is about being in the wrong regarding the breakup itself. Since she felt it was necessary for her own well-being, maybe she isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that she should have worked through her insecurities. \n\nOn the other hand, bisexuality doesn't necessarily mean he's not attracted to her. The fact that he's in a committed relationship suggests he's choosing to be with her. Her paranoia might be her own issues, not his. So maybe she's projecting her insecurities onto him. But if she can't accept his bisexuality, even after understanding it's not about her, then the breakup is her choice. \n\nIn the AITA format, people often debate whether the person's reasoning is justified. Since she admitted the real reason, and she felt it was necessary, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B for No.\n"
