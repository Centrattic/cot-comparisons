Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual. The boyfriend is 26, the author is 24. They were together for two years. The key points here are the boyfriend's disclosure of his bisexuality, the author's reaction, and the reasons given for the breakup.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend came out as bisexual. He mentioned he had hooked up with guys before. The author says she's not against his sexuality but found it surprising because she's only dated straight guys. The main issue here seems to be the author's discomfort with his bisexuality leading her to break up. She also mentions that their sex life isn't very active, with her initiating most of the time, which made her question if he's even attracted to her. She ended up breaking up, but she lied about the reason, not telling him it was because of his bisexuality.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, when someone discloses their sexuality, it's a personal choice and often a brave step. The author's reaction was to break up because of his bisexuality, even though she claims she's okay with people being gay or bi. However, her actions contradict her stated acceptance. It's possible she felt insecure or had unspoken expectations about her partner's sexuality, which led to her decision.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, there's no clear legal or moral framework here, but in terms of ethical considerations, the author made a choice based on her own feelings. However, the fact that she lied about the reason for the breakup might indicate she felt guilty or didn't want to confront her own biases. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which is not a wrongdoing. The author's decision to end the relationship because of something that doesn't affect her directly (as she says she's okay with his identity) could be seen as unfair. But maybe she felt it was necessary for her own happiness. Relationships require mutual understanding, and if her needs weren't being met (like emotional or physical connection), that's a valid reason. However, the root cause here seems to be her reaction to his bisexuality, which shouldn't be a deal-breaker if she truly believes in his right to be happy. So, she might be in the wrong for ending the relationship based on his sexuality rather than actual issues in the relationship.\n"
