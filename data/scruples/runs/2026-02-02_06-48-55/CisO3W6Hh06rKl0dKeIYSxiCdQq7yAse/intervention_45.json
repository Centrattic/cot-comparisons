Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a breakup after the boyfriend confessed he's bisexual. The author is questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend came out as bisexual and admitted he had hooked up with guys before. The author says they don't care about someone's sexuality but were taken aback because they've only dated straight guys. They mention that their relationship had low sexual frequency, with the author usually initiating. They started to get paranoid if the boyfriend was really into them and eventually broke up, but lied about the reason.\n\nThe author claims they don't care about bisexuality but maybe felt uncomfortable because it's new to them. They broke up because of his bisexuality but told a different reason. Now they're asking if they're at fault.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, in a healthy relationship, honesty is key. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which he had before the relationship. The author's issue seems to be more about his past and maybe their own insecurities rather than his current feelings towards them. However, people have different boundaries. If the author couldn't accept his bisexuality, even if they don't hate it, maybe they broke up because it made them uncomfortable. But the problem is the reason for the breakup. The author didn't trust their own feelings, maybe, and let insecurities from his past actions affect their current relationship. Also, lying about the breakup reason might not be fair to him. But in terms of being in the wrong, maybe the author isn't because everyone has the right to set boundaries in a relationship. However, the fact that the boyfriend was honest and the author couldn't handle it might mean the author is more at fault for not being secure in the relationship. Or is it his fault for not being open? Hmm.\n\nI think the key points are: Did the boyfriend do something wrong? He came out and was honest. The author's issue is his bisexuality and possible past actions. If the author couldn't accept that, then the breakup is their choice, but they might feel wrong because they lied about the reason. But if the author's problem is that they're uncomfortable with his bisexuality, then maybe they are in the wrong for not being accepting. However, the author did mention they don't hate bisexuality, just that it's new to them. So maybe they're not in the wrong because they have the right to feel that way. But relationships should be based on mutual respect. If the boyfriend didn't cheat and was honest, then the author's issue is their own insecurity. So maybe the author is in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe not, because they have the right to choose their partner based on their comfort. It's a bit of a toss-up. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because they broke up over something the boyfriend was honest about and didn't affect their current relationship, just the author's personal discomfort. So answer A.\n"
