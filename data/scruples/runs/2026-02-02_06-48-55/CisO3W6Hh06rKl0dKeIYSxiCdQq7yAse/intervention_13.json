Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong after breaking up with her boyfriend because he's bisexual.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author says she doesn't care about his orientation but was shocked because she's only dated straight guys. She started questioning if he's using her to hide being gay and that he's not really attracted to her. The breakup was because of his bisexuality, but she lied about it. She admits if he hadn't come out, they'd still be together.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether it's wrong to end a relationship based on the partner's bisexuality, even if it's not about acceptance but personal discomfort. The key points are: the boyfriend was honest, the author found out and broke up, but she knows he's a good person and they could stay friends. She's lying about the real reason for the breakup.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nIn relationships, honesty and mutual respect are important. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which is a valid identity. The author's issue isn't with his bisexuality as a person but as part of her personal comfort. However, she ended the relationship because of something that wasn't a deal-breaker for her before. She didn't have sex often, and she usually initiates. But she's projecting that maybe he's not really interested in her. \n\nThe problem here is that the author is breaking up based on her own insecurities or possibly internalized biases. The boyfriend hasn't done anything to violate the relationship terms unless she was in a monogamous agreement and he was cheating. The scenario doesn't mention cheating, just his past hookups and his identity. So, she's ending the relationship because she's uncomfortable with his sexuality, even though she claims not to care. That's a bit contradictory. \n\nAlso, she lied about the reason for the breakup, which is problematic because it hides her true feelings and might be manipulative. If she couldn't handle it, maybe she should have considered her own boundaries before entering the relationship or at least be honest about her feelings. \n\nThe community often looks at whether the actions are respectful and justified. Since the boyfriend was upfront and there's no betrayal, the author's reaction might be seen as using the \"bisexual\" label as a reason to cover her own issues. That's why the user thinks she's in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, is it fair for her to have personal boundaries? Like, if she's only been with straight guys and this is a new situation for her, maybe she's not ready for a relationship with someone who's not exclusively into women. However, bisexuality is about being attracted to both genders, not necessarily needing to be with someone of the opposite sex. If the boyfriend is in a monogamous relationship with her, his bisexuality doesn't affect their relationship unless she's uncomfortable with it. \n\nYet, the fact that she's not in the relationship because of his sexuality, even if she's not rejecting his identity, might still be a problem. It's about whether it's a valid reason to break up when there's no actual harm done. The boyfriend's honesty is something to appreciate, not a reason to end the relationship. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because she ended the relationship based on her own discomfort with his sexuality, even though she claims not to have a problem with it. She should have been honest with herself and him before making the decision. Also, lying about the reason is not respectful. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
