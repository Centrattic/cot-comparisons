Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend came out as bisexual and had previously hooked up with guys. The author says they don't care about someone's sexuality, but they were taken aback because they had only dated straight guys before. The relationship wasn't very sexual, and the author started doubting if their partner was really attracted to them. They broke up but lied about the reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The boyfriend came out as bi, which the author found unexpected. The author's main issue seems to be not with bisexuality itself but with the fact that their partner was hiding past relationships with men. They also mention that the physical aspect of the relationship wasn't as active as expected, leading to paranoia about his attraction. \n\nThe author ended the relationship, but when asked, they lied about the reason. The question is whether the author is at fault. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is important. The boyfriend did disclose his bisexuality and past hookups, which the author might have found difficult to handle. The author's reaction could stem from insecurity about the partner's attraction, especially since their sexual frequency was low and the author initiated most times. However, the author's decision to break up because of the partner's bisexuality, even though they claim they don't have an issue with it, might be problematic. \n\nBut wait, the author also mentions they were taken aback because they hadn't dated a non-straight person before. So maybe their reaction is based on personal discomfort rather than the partner's sexuality itself. The partner didn't hide his identity; he came forward voluntarily. The author then lied about the breakup reason. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, if someone can't accept their partner's sexuality, even if it's not something they've experienced before, that's a problem. The partner was honest, and the author's issue is more about their own insecurities or not understanding bisexuality. However, the author does state they don't care about sexuality, so maybe their actions contradict their stated beliefs. \n\nOn the flip side, the relationship was already having issues with intimacy, which could be a separate factor. But the author broke up specifically because the partner came out, which might be unfair. The partner might not have known about the author's potential issues with bisexuality before coming out, so maybe the author is at fault for not being honest about their own boundaries regarding their partner's past or orientation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is justified because they felt their partner wasn't truly attracted to them, leading to the breakup. However, the author's own feelings of insecurity might have been the real issue, not the partner's sexuality. \n\nI think the main point is that the author ended the relationship because of the partner's bisexuality, despite saying they don't care. The partner was honest, so the author's reaction could be considered in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be \"A\" (the author is in the wrong).\n"
