Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend came out as bisexual after two years of dating. The author says they don't care about others' sexuality but were taken aback because they'd never dated someone not straight before. They broke up, lying about the real reason, claiming it was due to personal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The boyfriend's honesty about his sexuality isn't a betrayal per se. Bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation, and coming out isn't something to be ashamed of. The author's reaction might stem from personal insecurities or discomfort with bisexuality, even if they say they don't care. The fact that the author broke up because of this, despite agreeing with his right to be happy, could indicate that their own biases played a role.\n\nAlso, the author mentions issues in the relationship like infrequent sex and lack of lust. These could have been existing problems that contributed to the breakup, but the key factor here is the bisexuality disclosure. The author lied about the reason for the breakup, which might add to the complexity. If the main reason was his sexuality, then the author's actions could be seen as wrong because it's not a valid reason to end a relationship. However, if the relationship was already strained and the disclosure was the final straw, that's different.\n\nIt's important to note that being bisexual doesn't mean someone isn't committed. The author's paranoia about him being gay and using her might not be valid either. The boyfriend didn't do anything wrong by being honest. The author's decision to end the relationship might be their own choice, but if it's solely based on his sexuality, that could be problematic. However, people have the right to leave a relationship for any reason they feel is right, even if others might not understand it. So, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the bisexuality was the main issue or if there were other underlying problems. Since the author admits they broke up because of his disclosure, and there's no mention of infidelity or other issues, the main reason seems to be his sexuality, which is a personal issue the author had to reconcile.\n"
