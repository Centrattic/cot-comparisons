Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who broke up with her boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. The situation is that they were in a two-year relationship. He told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. She didn't care about people's sexuality but was uncomfortable because she'd never dated a non-straight guy before. The relationship wasn't very sexual, with her initiating. She broke up with him, but lied about the reason, saying it was her personal issues instead of his bisexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The woman broke up because she couldn't handle his bisexuality, even though she claims she doesn't judge others. She admitted she's never dated someone non-straight before, which might indicate discomfort. The fact that she lied about the reason for the breakup is important. She said he's bi and she couldn't get past it, but blamed herself instead.\n\nNow, in relationships, honesty is key. She was honest with him about her feelings, but she lied about the reason for the breakup. That's a red flag. Also, the core issue is that she broke up because of his sexuality, even though she claims she doesn't care. That seems hypocritical. However, it's also possible that she felt that the mismatch in values or comfort levels made the relationship unsustainable. But since she admitted the issue was his bisexuality, which she claimed not to judge, that's a problem. She should have been honest with herself and him about her feelings. \n\nAnother angle: she might have felt insecure or not fully accepted his bisexuality, leading to her paranoia about his attraction. But if she couldn't accept him for who he is, then the breakup isn't her being in the wrong per se, but the way she handled it (lying) could be. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong for breaking up. If the reason is because she couldn't accept his bisexuality, then yes, she is. But if she had other valid reasons (like lack of sexual chemistry) but used his bisexuality as an excuse, then maybe not. However, she admitted that the disclosure was the real reason. \n\nSo, considering all that, she broke up because she couldn't accept his sexuality, even though she said she doesn't judge. That's a contradiction. Therefore, she's in the wrong because she didn't accept him as he is and misrepresented her reasons. The answer should be A.\n"
