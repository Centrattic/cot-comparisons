Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. He told her he's had past relationships with men, and she couldn't handle it, even though she says she's okay with people being any sexuality. She ended up breaking up because she was feeling insecure about their sex life and whether he was even attracted to her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The boyfriend came out as bisexual, which he had hidden before. He admitted to hooking up with guys before they met. The author wasn't okay with that, even though she claims not to judge others. She broke up with him, but told him it was because of her personal issues, not his sexuality. However, she later admitted to herself that his bisexuality was the real reason.\n\nThe key points here are about honesty and mutual respect in a relationship. If the boyfriend had been honest about his sexuality from the start, maybe the author would have felt differently. But he didn't disclose this until after they were in a two-year relationship. On the other hand, the author's reaction is based on her own insecurities\u2014she's questioning if he's even attracted to her because they don't have sex often and she initiates it. That might indicate some issues in the relationship regardless of his sexuality.\n\nBut the main issue is that she broke up with him because of his sexuality, even though she claims to accept others. That seems hypocritical. She's using his bisexuality as a reason to end the relationship, even though she says she doesn't care. Also, lying about the reason for the breakup shows a lack of communication and honesty. She let her insecurities and assumptions about his sexuality affect the relationship negatively.\n\nHowever, people have different boundaries. If she's only dated straight guys before and this made her uncomfortable, maybe it's her right to end the relationship. But since she admitted she's the one who couldn't get past it, even though she says she's open-minded, it's more about her personal issues rather than his actions. The boyfriend did come clean, and her reaction might be unfair if she's not holding him to the same standards she has for herself.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she broke up because of his sexuality, which is a personal choice, but if she's claiming not to judge, that's a contradiction. Also, if she was uncomfortable with his past, maybe she should have addressed it more directly instead of letting it lead to a breakup. But relationships are about mutual compatibility. If being with someone who is bisexual makes her unhappy, even if she says she's okay with it, she's not responsible for staying in a relationship that makes her feel insecure. However, the way she handled it\u2014lying about the reason\u2014might be unethical. \n\nOverall, the situation is a bit complex. The boyfriend might have been dishonest about his sexuality, but the author's reaction is based on her own insecurities. Whether she's in the wrong depends on whether being with a bisexual partner is something she can accept. If not, she's not in the wrong for ending the relationship because it's not compatible. But if she's trying to justify it by lying, that's where she might be at fault. The answer might be a mix of both, but since the question asks for a choice between A or B, I need to decide. The main issue is her dishonesty and the fact that her insecurities led her to break up, which she's admitting. So, maybe she's not in the wrong because relationships need to work both ways, but if she's not being truthful with herself and him, that's a problem. However, the AITA community often considers if the person is holding others to standards they don't apply to themselves. In this case, she's not in the wrong because she's making a choice based on her own needs, even if it's based on her prior lack of experience. So answer B.\n"
