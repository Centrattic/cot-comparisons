Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend confessed he's bisexual, and the author ended the relationship because of that. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend is 26, and the author is 24. They've been together for two years. The boyfriend mentioned he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author says they don't care about his sexuality, but they're confused because they've never dated a non-straight guy before. The author then starts questioning the relationship's sex frequency and their partner's attraction, leading to the breakup. The author admits that the real reason is the boyfriend's bisexuality but blames personal issues instead.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up because of his bisexuality. Let me break it down. \n\nBisexuality means being attracted to both genders. If the author is in a monogamous relationship and the boyfriend is bisexual, does that inherently mean there's a problem? The author says they don't mind his sexuality, but the fact that he had past relationships with men made them uncomfortable. Also, they mention not feeling lust from him. \n\nWait, the author is a woman, and the boyfriend is a man. If he's bisexual, he's attracted to women and men. But if he's in a relationship with a woman, his bisexuality doesn't necessarily mean he's not attracted to her. The author might be conflating bisexuality with being gay. Also, the author's discomfort comes from not having dated a non-straight person before, leading to uncertainty. \n\nAnother point is the author's admission that they lied about the reason for the breakup. They said it was personal stuff but actually it was his bisexuality. That might show dishonesty. Also, the author is projecting their insecurities onto the relationship. The boyfriend didn't do anything wrong by disclosing his sexuality. The author's decision to end the relationship is based on personal discomfort rather than any betrayal or action from the boyfriend. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to be comfortable with each other's identities. If the author can't accept bisexuality, maybe it's a deal-breaker for them. But in this case, the boyfriend didn't hide his past; he came out to the author. The author's reaction is based on their own personal issues and past experiences, not the boyfriend's actions. \n\nSo, while the author has the right to end a relationship if they're not comfortable, the problem here is that they're blaming their own insecurities and lack of experience on the boyfriend. The boyfriend's bisexuality isn't a reason to end the relationship unless the author is in a monogamous relationship and the boyfriend is being unfaithful, which isn't the case here. The author's choice to end it because of his sexual orientation, despite saying they don't care, might make them the one in the wrong for not being honest about their feelings and for making the breakup about the boyfriend's identity instead of their own issues.\n"
