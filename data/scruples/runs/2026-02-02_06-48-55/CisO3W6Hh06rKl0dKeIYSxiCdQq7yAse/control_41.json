Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong (AITA) for breaking up with her boyfriend after he admitted he's bisexual. The situation is presented in a Reddit-style post, so I need to analyze the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend came out as bisexual and mentioned he had hooked up with guys before. The author is okay with bisexuality in general but felt uncomfortable because she's only dated straight guys. She broke up with him, but she's not sure if the bisexuality was the real reason or if other factors were at play. She admitted lying about the reason for the breakup.\n\nNow, considering the elements here. Bisexuality is about attraction to more than one gender. It doesn't inherently mean he's not attracted to her. The author's main issue seems to be her own uncertainty and possible incompatibility in terms of his sexual orientation, even though she claims she's accepting of others' orientations. The fact that she broke up with him after his confession suggests her personal boundaries or insecurities were a factor. \n\nIs it wrong to break up because of someone's bisexuality? That depends on the context. If the relationship was monogamous and the other person's bisexuality didn't affect their commitment, then the breakup might be based on the author's inability to accept that aspect. However, being honest about one's needs and boundaries is important. If the author felt uncomfortable with the possibility of not being fully compatible (like not being attracted to him), then maybe the breakup is her way of acknowledging that. \n\nBut the key point here is that the author is not in the wrong for prioritizing her own feelings and boundaries. However, she is in the wrong for lying about the reason for the breakup. Honesty is crucial in relationships, especially when breaking up. By lying, she didn't give her ex a chance to address her concerns or potentially work through them. Also, the fact that she's questioning his attraction to her, but he's been in a two-year relationship with her might indicate her own insecurities rather than his lack of attraction. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because she didn't communicate her true reasons and broke up based on her own discomfort with his bisexuality, which is not a valid reason to end a relationship unless it's a deal-breaker they discussed beforehand. Since she admitted she's never dated a non-straight person, her discomfort is personal, and hiding the real reason for the breakup shows dishonesty.\n"
