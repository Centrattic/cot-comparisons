Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend disclosed his bisexuality and past hookups with men. The author of the post (a woman) says she doesn't care about his orientation, but she's struggling with the fact that he might not be attracted to her and the sex frequency is low. She ended up breaking up, but lied about the reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if being bisexual is a valid reason to break up. Bisexuality itself isn't inherently a deal-breaker. The key issue here is the author's reaction. She claims she's accepting of others' orientations but found herself unable to move past this. However, she also mentions that her boyfriend's disclosure led her to question his attraction to her, even though he compliments her. She didn't confront him directly but instead broke up, which he denied was the real reason.\n\nLying about the breakup reason could be problematic. If the real issue was his sexuality, then the breakup is based on something she now admits she can't accept, even though she claims to be okay with it. That might suggest inconsistency. Also, if the relationship was otherwise good except for this, her choice to end it might be seen as her being in the wrong because she couldn't accept his identity. However, people have different deal-breakers. If she's not comfortable being in a relationship with a bisexual partner, even if she says she is, then it's her right to end it. But the fact that she lied about the reason and didn't communicate honestly might make her the one in the wrong. The question is whether her feelings are valid or if she's being inconsiderate by not accepting his identity. Since she admitted she couldn't get past it, and the breakup was directly linked to his bisexuality, even though she denied it, that might show she's being dishonest with herself and him. So the answer is likely A.\n"
