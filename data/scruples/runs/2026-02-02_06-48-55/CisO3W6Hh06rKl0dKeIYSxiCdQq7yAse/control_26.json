Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual. She says she doesn't care about his sexuality, but the breakup happened because she couldn't get past his past relationships with men and started doubting his attraction to her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend came out as bisexual and mentioned he had hooked up with guys before they met. The author was surprised because she's only dated straight guys before. She felt the relationship lacked physical intimacy, with her usually initiating sex once a week. After his confession, she started questioning his attraction to her and ended the relationship, but lied about the real reason.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend made a personal disclosure, and the author's reaction led to the breakup. The user is asking if the author is at fault. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust and communication are important. The boyfriend came clean about his sexuality before any current issues, which is honest. The author admitted she couldn't accept the situation, which is her personal issue. However, breaking up because of someone's sexuality, even if it's a personal struggle, might be seen as problematic. The author's reasoning is that she felt the relationship wasn't fulfilling, but the timing of the breakup after the confession suggests her insecurities might have played a role.\n\nBut wait, the author states she doesn't judge others for their sexuality. She's just unaccustomed to dating someone who isn't straight. Her breakup was based on her inability to accept his identity and her own doubts about the relationship's intimacy. In that case, she's not necessarily in the wrong because people have different deal-breakers. However, it's possible that she was unfair because the boyfriend was honest and the author's insecurities were her own to work through. \n\nAlternatively, if the author was in a monogamous relationship and his bisexuality didn't affect their current dynamic, then her breakup might be based on his identity rather than any actions. That could be considered discriminatory. But if the lack of sexual chemistry and infrequent intimacy were existing issues, maybe the breakup is more about compatibility. However, she attributes the breakup to his sexuality despite lying about the reason. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether her decision to break up was based on his inherent identity (bisexual) rather than his actions. If she couldn't accept his identity, she might be in the wrong. But if the relationship had underlying issues, then the breakup could be justified. But the key here is the author's admission that the real reason was his bisexuality, even though she lied about it. That implies she made the decision based on his identity, which could be seen as her being in the wrong. However, people can have different reasons for ending relationships, and not all are considered \"wrong.\"\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author is in the wrong. While it's valid to have personal boundaries, breaking up solely because someone is bisexual\u2014especially after they were honest about their identity\u2014reflects a lack of acceptance rather than a justified decision. The author admitted her discomfort stemmed from his past and insecurities about the relationship's intimacy, not from any current behavior. Holding someone accountable for not meeting expectations tied to their sexuality, rather than addressing the relationship's existing issues openly, makes her at fault.",
