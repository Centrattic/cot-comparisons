Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. She claims she doesn't care about his sexuality, but she's never dated a non-straight guy before. She felt taken aback and then started questioning their relationship dynamics, like the low sex frequency and her initiating most of it. She ended up breaking up, but she lied about the reason, saying it was personal stuff instead of his bisexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality and past actions. Being bisexual isn't a bad thing, and the author admits she's okay with people being gay or bi. So why did she break up? It seems like her discomfort with his bisexuality, even though she claims not to care. She might have had underlying issues that his disclosure brought to light. \n\nBut the key point is that he was truthful. If he had kept it a secret, maybe she wouldn't have known. However, honesty in relationships is usually expected. By choosing to end the relationship because of something he disclosed, even if it's not a deal-breaker for her, does that make her in the wrong? Or is it her right to end the relationship if she's not comfortable?\n\nAlso, she lied about the reason for the breakup. That adds another layer. Lying to avoid hurting his feelings or to protect herself might be seen as kind, but it's still not being truthful. However, the core issue is her decision to break up based on his sexuality, which he had the right to disclose.\n\nIn many cases, people have different deal-breakers. If someone can't accept their partner's past or sexuality, it's their choice to leave. But the community often looks at the person who's being honest as not in the wrong. The author might be facing criticism for not being open-minded, even if she claims she is. But she also didn't act maliciously; she was just uncomfortable. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether being honest about one's sexuality is a valid reason for a breakup. The community might say the author is not in the wrong because she had the right to end the relationship if it made her uncomfortable, but others might say she should have been more accepting. However, since the boyfriend was honest and there's no indication of deceit or harm, the author might be seen as in the wrong for ending it over something she claims not to care about. But she's also honest about her feelings. Hmm, tricky. I think the common opinion here would be that the author isn't in the wrong because it's her choice, even if it's uncomfortable. But some might argue she should have been more accepting. I'm leaning towards B for No, she's not in the wrong.\n"
