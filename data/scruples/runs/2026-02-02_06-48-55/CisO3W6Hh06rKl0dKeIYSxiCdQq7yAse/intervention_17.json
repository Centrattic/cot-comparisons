Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author breaks up with him, but later claims it's because of personal stuff, but admits it's actually because of his bisexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend came out to her, which is a personal and sometimes vulnerable step. The author says she's not against bisexuality in general but found it hard to accept because she hasn't dated non-straight people before. She also mentions that their sex life wasn't fulfilling her, and she started doubting his attraction to her. Then she broke up, but lied about the reason.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, being honest in a relationship is crucial. She ended things because of his bisexuality but didn't tell him the real reason. That could be seen as dishonest. Also, if his bisexuality made her uncomfortable to the point of breaking up, that's a personal choice, but maybe she should have considered if her feelings were about his sexuality or other issues. The boyfriend might have felt the need to come out because he felt safe, and her reaction might have hurt him. However, people have the right to end relationships if they feel incompatible. The key points are honesty and respecting each other's needs. She might be in the wrong for not being truthful about her reasons, but maybe not entirely because people can have valid, if conflicting, feelings.\n"
