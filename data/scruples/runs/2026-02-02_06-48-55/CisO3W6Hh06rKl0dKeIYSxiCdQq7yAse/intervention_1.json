Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend came out as bi, the author was taken aback, started doubting his feelings, and eventually ended the relationship, but lied about the reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The boyfriend didn't hide his bisexuality; he came out to her. The author says she doesn't mind his sexuality but wasn't used to dating a non-straight person. They had a low sexual frequency, and she started questioning if he was using her to hide being gay. She ended the relationship but blamed it on her own issues instead of his sexuality.\n\nNow, the key here is whether her reaction is justified. She claims she's not prejudiced against bisexuality but still couldn't handle it. The problem is that she broke up with him because of his sexual orientation, even if she didn't directly state it. The boyfriend, on the other hand, was honest about his identity. \n\nBisexuality is about being attracted to both genders, not necessarily needing to be in relationships with others. The author's issue seems to stem from insecurity about his attraction to her and the low sexual frequency, which might not be directly related to his bisexuality. However, she conflated his sexuality with her insecurities.\n\nThe question is whether it's fair to end a relationship because of someone's sexual orientation, even if it's not a prejudice against them. The author's hesitation to be honest about her reasons adds another layer of dishonesty. If the real reason is her inability to accept his bisexuality despite her claims, then she's being hypocritical. \n\nOn the other hand, if her feelings were genuine and based on personal incompatibility, maybe it's not entirely her fault. But given that she admitted the breakup was due to his confession, even though she denied it, it seems like she's in the wrong for not being able to accept his identity and for lying about the cause of the breakup. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions stem from her inability to accept her partner's bisexuality, leading to a breakup based on his identity. That makes her the asshole in this scenario.\n"
