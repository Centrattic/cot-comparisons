Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend confessed he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before the relationship. The author says she doesn't care about his sexuality but was taken aback because she's only dated straight guys. She ended the relationship, claiming it was due to her personal issues, but later admitted it was because of his bisexuality.\n\nThe key points here are consent and honesty. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which is important in a relationship. The author, however, felt uncomfortable after the revelation and broke up without being truthful about the real reason. She lied about the cause of the breakup, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should feel comfortable with each other's honesty. The boyfriend shared his sexuality upfront, which is a valid and personal matter. The author's reaction was based on not just his current identity but past actions. She mentions that they had a low sex frequency and she initiated it, leading her to question his attraction. However, it's possible that the issue wasn't his bisexuality per se but other unaddressed issues in the relationship. \n\nBut the main problem here is the author's honesty. She kept the real reason hidden, which could make the breakup seem unfair. Even though she might have valid feelings, not being truthful about the cause could be seen as wrong. The boyfriend might have wanted to work through it if he knew the real issue. \n\nSo, considering the facts, the author is in the wrong because she broke up without being honest about the true reason, even though her feelings are understandable. The boyfriend was honest, and she didn't communicate her concerns properly.\n"
