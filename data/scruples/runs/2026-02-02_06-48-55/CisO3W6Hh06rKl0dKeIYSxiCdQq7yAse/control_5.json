Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The woman broke up because she couldn't get past that, even though she says she doesn't care about his orientation. She ended the relationship, but blamed it on her personal issues instead of the truth.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: She didn't care about his sexuality in principle but couldn't handle the fact that he had relationships with men before. She broke up because of this, even though they had a two-year relationship. The boyfriend probably felt betrayed or hurt by the breakup, especially since she lied about the reason.\n\nNow, considering relationship ethics. People have the right to set boundaries. If she realized that she couldn't accept his past actions or his bisexuality, then ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. However, lying about the reason for the breakup might be inconsiderate. But is she in the wrong for breaking up?\n\nAlso, bisexuality is a valid orientation. The boyfriend didn't hide his identity; he came clean. She had the choice to accept or not. If the issue was his past, then it's about whether she could move past it. Since she couldn't, it's her decision. However, maybe she should have considered if her reaction was fair, given that bisexuality is about being attracted to multiple genders, not a phase or a cover-up as he suggested.\n\nBut the main thing is that she's honest with herself. If she couldn't accept his bisexuality, then breaking up was her right. However, lying about the reason might have caused unnecessary pain. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether her decision was justified. Since she felt it was important to her well-being, maybe not. But if she didn't give him a chance to address her concerns, maybe yes. However, the scenario doesn't mention attempts to talk it out. She just broke up after some paranoia. So maybe she's not wrong because she acted based on her feelings, even if it was difficult for him.\n"
