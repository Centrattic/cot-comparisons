Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a woman who broke up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. He told her he's had relationships with guys before, and that made her question whether he's really attracted to her. She ended things, but she's not sure if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They were together for two years. The boyfriend is 24, she's 26. He came out as bisexual, which she didn't know before. She says she doesn't care about his sexuality, but she's confused because she's never dated a guy who wasn't straight. That might mean she wasn't prepared for this aspect of his identity.\n\nShe mentions that they don't have sex often, and when they do, she usually initiates. She started doubting his attraction to her. Maybe she felt insecure or thought he was using her to hide his bisexuality. But she broke up with him because of his bisexuality, even though she claims it's not about his sexuality. She lied about the reason, saying it was personal issues.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. In relationships, honesty is key. She didn't accept his bisexuality and ended the relationship because of it, even though she later admits he didn't do anything wrong. So, maybe she's in the wrong for not accepting a part of him. But on the other hand, people have the right to be with someone they feel comfortable with. If she couldn't accept his bisexuality, even if it's not about being attracted to others, maybe she's not in the wrong for ending the relationship because she felt it wasn't right for her.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend didn't do anything wrong by coming out. The breakup was her decision based on her feelings about his sexuality. If she can't accept someone's identity, then maybe the breakup is justified from her perspective. However, some might argue that she should have communicated this better instead of lying about the reason. But the main issue is her inability to accept his bisexuality, which is a personal choice. So whether she's in the wrong depends on the perspective. But since the question is about being in the wrong, if she ended the relationship because of something he didn't hide, even if it's a personal choice for her, it might not be her fault. But others might say she should accept his identity. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. I think the answer might be B, meaning she's not in the wrong because people have the right to their boundaries, even if those boundaries are based on personal preferences they didn't realize they had until later. She didn't lie about who she was when they started dating, so if she can't accept his sexuality now, it's her choice to end the relationship even if it's uncomfortable.\n"
