Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" story is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nSo, the author is a 26-year-old guy who dated his girlfriend for two years. She's 24. He told her he's bisexual and admitted to hooking up with guys before. The girlfriend breaks up with him because she's uncomfortable with his bisexuality, even though she claims she doesn't have an issue with it. She says she's never dated a non-straight guy before and that their sex life isn't very active. She starts to doubt his attraction to her and blames her own personal issues for the breakup instead of his sexuality.\n\nThe main question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate it. \n\nFirst, coming out as bisexual isn't something that inherently harms the relationship. If he's honest about his identity, that's usually a good step. But the issue here is the girlfriend's reaction. She breaks up because she can't get past his bi identity, even though she says she doesn't care. That seems hypocritical. She's acting like she's open-minded but her actions show otherwise. \n\nBut wait, maybe there's more. The couple already had a low-sex relationship, with the girl initiating most of the time. She might be using his bisexuality as an excuse for other underlying issues. Like, maybe she was already unhappy with the sex life or other aspects of the relationship but felt more comfortable blaming his sexuality. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend lied about the reason for the breakup. She told him it was her personal stuff, but it was actually his sexuality. That's not honest. Honesty is important in relationships. If she couldn't be truthful about her reasons, that's a problem. \n\nBut is the guy in the wrong? He came clean about his bisexuality. If the girlfriend couldn't accept that, maybe it's her issue. In a healthy relationship, both partners should be comfortable with each other's identities. If she's not okay with his bisexuality, even if she claims she is, then the breakup is her decision. However, the way she handled it\u2014lying about the reason\u2014could be seen as unfair. \n\nBut from the guy's perspective, he might feel that he was honest and it's not his fault if she can't accept him. On the other hand, maybe she should have addressed her discomfort before the breakup instead of keeping it a secret. \n\nSo, considering everything, the girl's decision to break up might be her right, but the way she did it (lying) and not being truthful about her feelings could make her the asshole. However, the guy isn't in the wrong for being who he is. So the answer would be that the author (the guy) is not in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
