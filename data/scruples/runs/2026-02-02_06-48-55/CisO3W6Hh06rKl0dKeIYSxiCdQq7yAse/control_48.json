Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: the boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. She says she doesn't care about his sexuality but then broke up with him, lying about the real reason. She admits that his sexuality made her question his feelings for her and led to the breakup.\n\nSo, the core issue here is whether it's fair to break up over his bisexuality. The user is asking if the author (the person in the AITA post) is at fault. \n\nI need to consider a few things. First, bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation, and being attracted to more than one gender doesn't inherently mean he's not committed or not interested in the relationship. The fact that he came out to her shows some level of trust. \n\nThen, the breakup was based on her inability to accept his sexuality, even though she claims she doesn't judge. However, her actions indicate that it did affect her. She felt insecure about his attraction to her, leading her to end the relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require mutual understanding and acceptance. If one person can't accept the other's sexuality despite their best efforts, it's a valid reason to end the relationship. However, the act of breaking up because of someone's sexuality could be seen as problematic because it's a personal choice and not a deal-breaker for everyone. \n\nBut here, the author admits she couldn't get past it, which is a personal issue. She's not wrong for feeling that way if it's affecting her happiness. However, by lying about the reason for the breakup, she might have been dishonest, which complicates things. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's previous hookups with men\u2014was that something he was open about before the relationship? If he was honest from the start, maybe the issue is the author's inability to accept his past. However, he only came out after they were in the relationship. \n\nIn many cases, people may not disclose their full sexual orientation or past unless asked. If the author didn't know before and it came as a surprise, but he was honest once he realized it, then she had a right to consider that in her decision. \n\nBut the key point is whether bisexuality itself is a valid reason to end a relationship. Since it's a personal choice, and the author couldn't accept it despite her initial stance, she's not wrong for ending it. However, the dishonesty in the breakup might make her seem less honest, but the main reason she's at fault is if she's wrong for breaking up over his sexuality, which is not a deal-breaker for many. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is personal, and she's not necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship due to her own insecurities and inability to accept his sexuality, even if that's a personal choice.\n"
