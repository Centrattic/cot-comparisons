Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual. He also admitted to hooking up with guys before, which surprised her. She says she doesn't care about orientation, but she's never dated a non-straight guy. She then broke up with him, but blamed it on her personal issues instead of his sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The boyfriend came out as bisexual and mentioned past relationships with men. The author was taken aback because she's only been with straight guys. She started questioning if he was using her to hide being gay and felt he wasn't attracted to her. She ended the relationship but lied about the reason, saying it was her own issues. Now she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nIn relationships, honesty and mutual compatibility are important. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which is a valid aspect of himself. The author felt uncomfortable with his orientation, leading to her breaking up. However, she didn't directly address her feelings about his bisexuality but instead gave a different reason. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, which I can see. The author's issue isn't with his behavior (like being unfaithful) but his identity. Since bisexuality is part of his identity, if the author can't accept that, it's a deal-breaker for her. But lying about the reason for the breakup could be problematic. However, the main question is if the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship because of his sexuality. \n\nIn many ethical discussions, people have the right to end relationships if they can't accept a partner's identity. However, the lie about the reason might make it seem like the author isn't being truthful, which could be a flaw. But the core reason is her incompatibility with his orientation. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for breaking up, but the way she handled it (lying) might be questionable. However, the main issue is whether her decision to break up due to his sexuality is wrong. Since she admitted she couldn't get past it, even though she claims to support others' orientations, it's a personal choice. But some might argue that it's wrong to end a relationship based on a partner's sexual orientation when it doesn't affect their behavior in the relationship. \n\nHowever, in AITA scenarios, people often judge based on fairness and whether the decision was justified. Since the boyfriend was honest, the author's issue is with his orientation, which is a personal choice. So, the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship because of his bisexuality, even if she's honest about her feelings now. Alternatively, it's her right to end the relationship if she can't accept it. \n\nBut since she's lying about the reason, maybe that's a red flag. However, the core issue is her decision to break up because of his sexuality. In many cases, this is seen as wrong, as it's a form of discrimination. So the answer is A.\n"
