Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. The boyfriend admitted to having hooked up with guys before, but the author had only dated straight guys before. They mention that their sex life wasn't very frequent and they usually initiated it. The author started doubting if the boyfriend was really into them and eventually broke up, but lied about the reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author has a valid reason for breaking up. The key points are the boyfriend's bisexuality and the author's discomfort with it. The author states they don't judge people's sexuality but are unsettled because they haven't dated a non-straight person before. The problem here is that the author's main issue seems to be the boyfriend's bisexuality, even though they claim to accept it. The boyfriend didn't do anything wrong by coming out, so the author's reaction is based on their own discomfort.\n\nAlso, the author lied about the breakup reason. The boyfriend thought it was about personal issues, but actually, it was his bisexuality. That could be seen as dishonest, especially if the author knew that the real issue was his sexuality. The author's paranoia about not being attracted to the boyfriend might stem from their own insecurities rather than the boyfriend's actions. The boyfriend didn't force anything or hide his past; he was honest. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial, and the boyfriend was upfront. The author's decision to break up because of his sexuality, even if they claim to accept it, might be considered the author's choice, but is it \"wrong\"? Since the author is the one who can't accept it despite their initial statement, they might be in the wrong for not being able to handle the situation maturely. However, everyone has their deal-breakers. But the lie about the reason for the breakup adds another layer of dishonesty. \n\nSo, the author's main fault is breaking up based on the boyfriend's sexuality, which they said they were okay with, and lying about it. That seems to make them at fault. So the answer would be A.\n"
