Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual. He mentioned he had hooked up with guys before, which made her uncomfortable. She says she doesn't care about his sexuality, but the breakup happened anyway.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The boyfriend came out as bisexual, which is a personal disclosure. The author felt it was a reason to end the relationship, even though she claims it's not about his sexuality but maybe his attraction towards her. Wait, she mentions that they don't have sex often, she usually initiates, and she's wondering if he's even attracted to her. So maybe her insecurity or concerns about his attraction were there before, and his bisexuality just became the catalyst.\n\nBut is it fair for her to break up because of his bisexuality if she doesn't care about that? She says she doesn't judge, but her actions suggest otherwise. In a monogamous relationship, the fact that someone is bisexual doesn't inherently mean they are unfaithful or not committed. However, if she's not comfortable with his orientation, even though she claims she is, that's a problem. \n\nAlso, she lied about the reason for the breakup. She told him it was due to her personal issues, but it was really his bisexuality. That's a red flag. Honesty in relationships is crucial. Maybe she felt guilty and didn't want to hurt his feelings, but lying about the reason can lead to resentment or unresolved issues. \n\nOn the other hand, people have different deal-breakers. If she wasn't comfortable with his past same-sex encounters or his orientation, it's her right to end the relationship. But the way she handled it\u2014lying\u2014might be unethical. However, she does express that she wants to stay friends, which shows she cares about his feelings. \n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend came forward with his sexuality, which took courage. The author's reaction might be seen as a rejection of his truth, even if she says she's accepting. The fact that she broke up after his disclosure could be seen as a problem, but if their relationship had underlying issues (like low sexual frequency, her initiating) then maybe the bisexuality was just the final issue.\n\nBut the key question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's not in a position to accept someone's sexuality despite her claims, that's an issue. Also, if the real reason for the breakup was her not feeling desired, which is more about their relationship dynamics, then the bisexuality might be a red herring. However, she admits that his coming out was the actual reason. \n\nIn summary, while it's her choice to end the relationship, the way she handled it (lying) and the fact that she claims acceptance but acted differently could make her at fault. But relationships are complex, and people have different boundaries. The answer might hinge on whether lying about the reason is the bigger issue than the breakup itself.\n"
