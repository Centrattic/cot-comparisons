Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who broke up with her boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the context.\n\nShe dated him for two years and he admitted he's bisexual, had hooked up with guys before. She says she doesn't have a problem with people's sexuality, but she's never dated a non-straight guy before. She was taken aback. Then she started questioning if he was using her to cover being gay, and felt he wasn't attracted to her. She broke up with him saying it was personal stuff, but later admits the real reason was his bisexuality.\n\nThe key points here are about honesty and whether her reaction is justified. Bisexuality is about being attracted to multiple genders. The fact that he had past relationships with men doesn't inherently mean he's not attracted to women. She's the one feeling insecure, maybe projecting her own feelings onto him. Breaking up because of his sexuality could be problematic, especially since she admitted she didn't have an issue with his orientation, but her personal experience led her to feel that way.\n\nAlso, she lied about the reason for the breakup. He thought it was his bi status, but she denied it. That could add to the issue, as not being honest about the real reason might cause more hurt. In relationships, communication is key. If she had issues with his past or his sexuality, she should have addressed them openly. Instead, she broke up and lied, which might be seen as unfair to him.\n\nBut then again, people have different deal-breakers. Maybe for her, knowing his past and bisexuality made her uncomfortable, even if she logically accepted it. It's about personal compatibility. However, breaking up based on his identity could be seen as discriminatory if she can't accept it despite her own stated acceptance. But she clarifies she doesn't care about his orientation, so maybe it's more about insecurity.\n\nIn some cases, people might have a hard time adjusting if their partner's past includes same-sex relationships, but that's more about personal bias. If she can't accept that, maybe it's not fair to him. But she also mentions that the sex life was infrequent and initiated by her, which might contribute to her feelings of incompatibility. However, she's attributing her breakup to his sexuality, even if other factors might be at play.\n\nSo, considering all that, the question is whether breaking up solely because he's bisexual is wrong. If the issue is that he's using her to hide being gay, but she admitted she doesn't care about his orientation, then her real issue might be with his past actions (hooking up with guys) rather than his identity. But if she can't accept that, then maybe she is in the wrong for breaking up over his sexuality, which is a personal choice and not something he can change. However, if the problem is that he wasn't honest earlier, but he did disclose it, then she's reacting to information that he provided.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong in relationships, it's subjective. But generally, if someone can't accept their partner's identity after they've been in a relationship for two years, it might be considered wrong to end it over that, especially if the person has stated they don't have an issue with it. But personal feelings and comfort are valid. The lying part complicates it because she didn't tell him the real reason, which might be inconsiderate.\n\nSo, the answer probably leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because she ended the relationship due to his sexuality, which she initially stated wasn't an issue, and lied about the reason, which could be seen as unfair. But some might argue it's her right to end the relationship if she feels incompatible.\n"
