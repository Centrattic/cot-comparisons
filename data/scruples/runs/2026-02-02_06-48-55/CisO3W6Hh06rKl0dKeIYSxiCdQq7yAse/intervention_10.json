Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user provided a situation where the author (the woman) broke up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend confessed he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The woman didn't care about his orientation per se but was uncomfortable because she's never dated a non-straight person. She ended the relationship, but she lied about the reason, saying it was due to personal issues. She admitted the real reason was his bisexuality.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, relationships are based on mutual compatibility. If someone can't accept a partner's identity, even if they say they don't care, maybe it's a problem. The boyfriend came out, which is a personal matter. The woman felt her values or needs weren't met in the relationship, leading to the breakup. \n\nBut wait, she didn't care about his orientation itself, but maybe felt it affected their sex life. She mentioned initiating sex most of the time and not feeling lust. Maybe she was using his bisexuality as a reason to break up because of other underlying issues. However, she did admit that if he hadn't come out, they'd still be together. That suggests his coming out was the catalyst for her decision, even if other factors were present.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit tricky. People have the right to end relationships if they feel incompatible. But if she's breaking up because of something that's not about mutual respect or genuine incompatibility, maybe she's in the wrong. The fact that she lied about the breakup reason could indicate she felt guilty or didn't want to hurt him, but still made a decision based on his sexuality.\n\nAnother angle: bisexuality is valid, and she's choosing not to be with someone because of it. Even if she's not judgmental, maybe she can't handle the implications for her own needs. But that's her prerogative. However, if she's not in conflict with his orientation but with other aspects that he brings up (like the sex frequency), maybe it's unfair to attribute the breakup solely to his bisexuality.\n\nThe community usually looks at AITA cases by considering if the person acted wrongly. In this case, the woman is not forcing the issue but is ending the relationship because she can't accept his identity, even if others might find that acceptable. It's a personal choice, but if the issue is about his sexuality and not about his actions (like cheating), then maybe she's not wrong. But if she's projecting other insecurities onto his orientation, then maybe she is.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether breaking up because of someone's sexuality is acceptable. Since it's not illegal or unethical, her decision is a matter of personal choice. However, if she's not actually opposed to bisexuality but is using it as an excuse for other issues, that's different. The story says she's okay with people being gay/bi but it's new for her, so she's conflicted. The breakup seems to be her way of dealing with her own discomfort rather than his actions. \n\nIn AITA terms, the community often considers if the person's actions were justified. Since she's ending the relationship for personal reasons, not malice, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if the community thinks accepting a partner's sexuality is a basic requirement, then she might be. But I think in modern discussions, people might side with her because it's her right to choose, even if it's based on personal incompatibility.\n"
