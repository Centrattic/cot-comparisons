Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend is in the wrong because he's bisexual. The boyfriend came out as bisexual, which shocked the author. The author was okay with his bisexuality but had underlying concerns about the relationship's dynamics, like infrequent sex and the boyfriend initiating it. The author ended things but admitted it was because of his bisexuality, even though they lied about the reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality. The author's issue isn't with bisexuality per se but with the implications of it. The author felt that maybe the boyfriend wasn't attracted to her, leading to the breakup. But the user is asking if the author is wrong for breaking up over this.\n\nBisexuality allows for attraction to multiple genders, so the boyfriend could still be attracted to the author. However, the author's insecurities led to the breakup. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Legally, no one is in the wrong; relationships are personal. However, in terms of right or wrong in social situations, like an AITA scenario, it's more about societal expectations.\n\nThe key points are: the boyfriend was honest, and the author had pre-existing issues. However, the author broke up because of his sexuality, which the boyfriend didn't hide. The author admitted they couldn't get past it, which is their personal issue. The boyfriend didn't do anything to warrant the breakup except being honest. So, is the author wrong for breaking up over something he didn't hide? Typically, in AITA, if someone is inconsiderate of another's feelings, they're at fault. The author was honest about their feelings but chose to hide the real reason. The boyfriend's honesty was met with a breakup based on his identity, which might be seen as the author being in the wrong. However, if the author's personal boundaries can't accept bisexuality, even if the person is committed, it's their choice. The answer might be A (Yes) because the author broke up over his being bi, which is his identity and he didn't hide it. The author's choice is valid, but in an AITA context, it's often considered wrong to end a relationship solely because of someone's sexuality if it's disclosed upfront. However, if the author had genuine concerns about compatibility, it's a gray area. The user says they don't care about bisexuality but couldn't accept it, so maybe the answer is B (No). Wait, the user says they don't care about bisexuality, but they broke up because of it. So maybe they are in the wrong because they contradicted themselves. If they can't accept someone's bisexuality despite saying they don't care, that's the issue. So the answer is A.\n"
