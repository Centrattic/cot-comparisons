Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend came out as bisexual and had past relationships with men. The author mentions they don't care about his sexuality but felt insecure about the sex frequency and whether he's attracted to her. They ended up breaking up but lied about the reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Bisexuality is about attraction to multiple genders, not necessarily a betrayal. The boyfriend was honest by telling her. The author's issue seems to stem from jealousy and insecurity rather than the bisexuality itself. The problem is that the author couldn't accept that the boyfriend might not be as physically attracted to her as she thought, which is a personal issue rather than the boyfriend's fault. Also, the author lied about the reason for the breakup, which could be seen as dishonest. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to be compatible in terms of needs and communication. If the author was uncomfortable with his past or his sexuality, maybe they should have addressed it earlier. Since he was upfront, and the author's insecurities led to the breakup, it's more about her personal comfort with his identity. However, if being in a relationship with someone who has a different sexual orientation causes her persistent insecurity, it might be valid for her to end it, but she's in the wrong for not being honest about the real reason. \n\nSo, the answer is A because the author is in the wrong for not accepting his sexuality and for dishonestly ending the relationship.\n"
