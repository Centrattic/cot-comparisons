Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation better.\n\nThe user is a woman who's asking if she's at fault for breaking up after her boyfriend told her he's bisexual. He had already hooked up with guys before they were together. She says she doesn't care about other people's sexuality but was surprised because she never dated a non-straight guy. The relationship had a low sex frequency, and she started wondering if he was using her to hide his sexuality. She ended up breaking up, but she admitted it was because of his bisexuality, even though she told him it was her personal issues. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation, and someone's orientation shouldn't be a dealbreaker if the person is honest and the relationship is working otherwise. The boyfriend was honest and shared his truth, which is important in a relationship. However, the woman felt uncomfortable and decided to end things. \n\nBut why did she feel that way? She mentioned that the sex was initiated by her and the frequency was lower. Maybe her discomfort came from insecurity or not feeling desired. However, the fact that he's bisexual shouldn't inherently affect his attraction to her unless there's a deeper issue. She admitted she couldn't get past it, which might be her own issue rather than his.\n\nAnother angle is the right to self-determination. She's not in the wrong if she realized the relationship wasn't fulfilling her needs. But the problem is that she ended it because of his sexuality, which is a personal choice but could be seen as discriminatory if she can't accept it. \n\nIt's important to note that she doesn't have issues with bisexuality in general but was unprepared for it in her own relationship. That's a common experience, but it's something she had to confront. If the relationship wasn't working for her due to this reason, maybe it's her prerogative. However, ending the relationship because of someone's sexuality might be seen as unfair unless there were other issues like dishonesty or infidelity.\n\nThe boyfriend was upfront, so he wasn't hiding anything. The woman had the choice to stay or leave. While ending the relationship is her right, the question is whether the reason is justifiable. If the core issue is her inability to accept his bisexuality despite her stated acceptance, that could be the problem. But if she felt it affected their dynamic and her happiness, then it's her choice.\n\nIn conclusion, breaking up because of someone's sexuality, even if stated upfront, can be seen as the person's choice, but it might be considered wrong if they claim not to care about it. However, the decision to end a relationship is complex and personal. The answer might depend on whether the woman's actions were based on prejudice or genuine incompatibility.\n"
