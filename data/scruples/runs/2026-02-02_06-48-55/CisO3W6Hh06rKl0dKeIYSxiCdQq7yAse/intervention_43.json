Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. She says she doesn't care about his orientation, but she's never dated a non-straight guy. She then started doubting if he's even attracted to her, since their sex life is infrequent and she usually initiates. She ended up breaking up with him, but denied it was because of his bisexuality and lied about the reasons. She admits that if he hadn't mentioned his sexuality, they'd still be together.\n\nHmm. So the main question is whether she's in the wrong. First, everyone has the right to their own boundaries in a relationship. If she realized that she needed someone who is exclusively attracted to her and her boyfriend isn't, then maybe breaking up isn't the wrong choice. But she did lie about the reason, which might be a factor. \n\nBut wait, sometimes people don't want to hurt someone's feelings directly, so maybe she chose to lie to protect his feelings. However, the core issue is that she couldn't accept his orientation, even though she claims she doesn't mind. The problem is that bisexuality is about attraction to multiple genders, not necessarily about infidelity. If the relationship was monogamous and he was honest, maybe her issue is more about insecurity or personal incompatibility rather than his sexuality itself. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's questioning if he's even attracted to her because of the sex frequency and her initiating might point to other issues in the relationship. Maybe the breakup is more about underlying problems, and the bisexuality was just the trigger. But since she couldn't accept his identity, which he disclosed honestly, is that valid?\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if being in a relationship with someone who isn't exclusively attracted to you is a dealbreaker, then she's not in the wrong for ending it. However, if she dismissed his bisexuality as a cover for being gay and not interested in her, that's problematic. Also, lying about the reason for the breakup could be seen as inconsiderate, but it's a common way people handle breakups to avoid direct blame.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because she made a decision based on her own needs and boundaries, even if it was uncomfortable.\n"
