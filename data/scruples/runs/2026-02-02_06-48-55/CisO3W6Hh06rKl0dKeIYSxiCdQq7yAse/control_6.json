Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So, the user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend confessed he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author says they don't care about his sexuality but ended up breaking up because they couldn't get past it. They admitted lying about the reason for the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which the author claims they accept. However, the author's main issues seem to be about the frequency of sex, the fact that they usually initiate it, and feelings of insecurity about his attraction. The author broke up because they couldn't handle the possibility that he might be gay or not fully into the relationship, even though they said they don't judge.\n\nIs it fair to break up because of someone's sexual orientation? In most cases, no, as everyone has the right to their identity. But the author's reasoning isn't just about his bisexuality\u2014it's about their personal feelings and doubts in the relationship. The author admits they didn't date any non-straight partners before, so maybe they weren't prepared for that aspect. The fact that they broke up after the confession suggests that the bisexuality wasn't the root problem but a catalyst. The root might be unaddressed issues about attraction and communication in the relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's coming out was honest, which is important. The author's reaction could be seen as invalidating his sexuality if they're breaking up just because he's not exclusively heterosexual. However, the author is also taking responsibility by acknowledging they lied about the breakup reason and that the issue was their own insecurities. They also mention that without the confession, they'd still be together, implying their comfort with his sexuality was the issue.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the relationship wasn't fulfilling for them, maybe they aren't in the wrong for ending it. However, using his sexuality as the reason, even if indirectly, could be problematic if it's a bias they weren't aware of. But the key here is that the author admits they don't judge and that the breakup was more about their own feelings of not being attracted and the existing issues in the relationship. The bisexuality was a factor they couldn't reconcile, but it's not the sole cause. Since the author is honest about their feelings and the breakup is based on their own insecurities rather than rejection of his identity, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But there's a nuance here. If the author had issues with bisexuality itself, that would be different. But they said they accept it. The problem seems to be more about their personal relationship dynamics. So, maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any clear wrongdoing. The author didn't lie about their reasons in the breakup with the boyfriend, they just didn't tell him the real reason. That could be seen as dishonest, but the question is about being in the wrong in the situation. The main ethical question is whether the author's decision is justified. Since they're taking responsibility and the issue is their own insecurities, it's more about personal difficulty than discrimination. So, the answer might be B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
