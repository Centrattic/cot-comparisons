Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend came out as bisexual and admitted to hooking up with guys before. The author was initially okay with it but then started questioning the relationship, leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the boyfriend's bisexuality and the author's reaction. The author says they don't have sex often, usually initiated by them, and started wondering if he's gay and using them. The boyfriend claims the breakup was about his bisexuality, but the author denied that and lied about the reason.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Relationships are about mutual respect and communication. The boyfriend came out, which is a personal matter, but the author felt unsettled. However, the author's decision to break up was based on the boyfriend's sexual orientation, which is a personal choice. \n\nBut wait, the author also mentions that they were already having issues with the frequency of sex and the boyfriend's lack of lust. Maybe the bisexuality was a trigger for existing insecurities. The author might have been projecting their own discomfort with the boyfriend's orientation onto the relationship's other issues. \n\nHowever, it's also important to note that the boyfriend was honest about his sexuality. The author had the choice to stay or leave. While it's not acceptable to break up just because someone is LGBTQ+, if the author couldn't be comfortable with the boyfriend's orientation despite not having issues with the person themselves, then the breakup could be seen as valid. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author admitted that the real reason was the boyfriend's bisexuality, even though they lied about it. That could be seen as dishonest. However, people have different comfort levels. If the author felt that the relationship wasn't fulfilling them due to other factors (like lack of sex) and the boyfriend's orientation made them question the relationship further, maybe they aren't entirely wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel hurt that the author lied about the reason, especially if they were trying to handle it sensitively. The author's initial reaction was to break up, which might be seen as a reaction to a personal characteristic rather than a behavior. However, in some cases, people can't reconcile differences in values or preferences, even if those are valid. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's decision was based on the boyfriend's identity versus actions. Since bisexuality is an inherent part of someone's identity and the author didn't express any issues with the boyfriend's behavior towards them, the breakup might be seen as the author's way of dealing with their own discomfort. But since they acknowledged the breakup was because of the boyfriend's bisexuality, it could be considered the author's choice, not necessarily being in the wrong. \n\nHowever, the community might argue that the author is in the wrong because they ended the relationship based on the boyfriend's sexual orientation rather than other issues, which is a personal choice but might not be justified. Alternatively, if the author felt their needs weren't met and the boyfriend's orientation contributed to that, it's a valid reason. \n\nIn the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the community often looks at whether the person acted with malicious intent. The author didn't hide the breakup but lied about the reason. However, the boyfriend's honesty might be a factor. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to end a relationship where they felt uncomfortable, especially if they can't get past the other person's orientation despite initial acceptance.\n"
