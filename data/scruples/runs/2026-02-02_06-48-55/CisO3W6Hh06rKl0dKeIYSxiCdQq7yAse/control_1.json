Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend came out as bisexual and admitted he had hooked up with guys before. The author says she's okay with people being gay or bi, but she's never dated a non-straight guy. She was taken aback but didn't have issues with his sexuality per se. However, she started questioning the relationship dynamics\u2014like the low sex frequency and her initiating sex. She became paranoid that he might not be attracted to her, even though he compliments her. She ended up breaking up, but she lied about the reason, saying it was her personal issues instead of his sexuality.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author broke up because she couldn't get past his bisexuality. She didn't want to be in a relationship where her partner had a different orientation than she expected. Even though she claims to support people's happiness, her actions led to the breakup because she wasn't comfortable with his identity. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require mutual compatibility. But when someone ends a relationship because they can't accept their partner's authentic self, that's usually seen as a problem. The author's issue wasn't with his past actions (he came clean), but with his sexuality itself. That makes her not in the wrong in the sense that she's choosing her comfort and needs, but ethically, it's better to be honest. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong for breaking up. Since she couldn't accept his identity, she's not in the wrong for leaving, but she's also not in the wrong for lying about the reason. Wait, but the lie is about the cause of the breakup. He might have the right to know the real reason. However, the core issue is whether she was wrong to end the relationship because of his bisexuality. Since bisexuality isn't a dealbreaker for most, but she had personal issues with it, the answer might be B (No), because it's her choice based on her comfort. But maybe the wrong is in not being honest about the reason. However, the question is about being in the wrong for breaking up. So if she's allowed to have her preferences, then no. But if she's wrong because she couldn't accept his identity, then yes. But the community often sides with people who end relationships if they realize it's not working for them, even if it's about sexuality. So the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
