Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend came out as bisexual and had past relationships with men. The author says they don't care about someone's sexuality but had never dated a non-straight person before. They broke up because they couldn't get past the fact that he's bi, even though their relationship wasn't meeting their sexual needs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality. The author's issue isn't with bisexuality itself but with the fact that he had past relationships with men. But the author admits they lied about the reason for the breakup, which complicates things. \n\nBisexuality itself isn't a dealbreaker, and the author claims they don't have a problem with people being bi. However, their action of breaking up after the disclosure suggests that there was an issue. The problem might be that the author's decision was based on the boyfriend's sexual orientation rather than other factors like behavior or compatibility. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that their relationship had low sexual frequency and lack of lust, which might have contributed to their discomfort. However, they didn't address these issues directly. Instead, they linked them to the boyfriend's sexuality, possibly as a way to rationalize the breakup. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author is unable to accept the boyfriend's bisexuality despite saying they don't have an issue with it, that could be seen as hypocritical. The boyfriend was honest, which is a positive step. The author's decision to break up based on something they claim not to care about might indicate underlying biases or fears. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be struggling with personal insecurities or unmet needs in the relationship. But the way they handled the breakup\u2014lying about the reason\u2014could be seen as unfair to the boyfriend. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because they broke up over something they claim not to have a problem with, and they didn't address the real issues in their communication. The boyfriend was honest, and the author's reaction seems inconsistent with their stated values. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
