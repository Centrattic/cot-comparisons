Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The main issue is whether her decision was justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend came out as bisexual and told her about his past experiences. The author says she's okay with people being gay or bi, but she's never dated someone who isn't straight. That might make her uncomfortable, but she's aware of her own bias. She clarifies that she's not against bisexuality in general, but this situation made her question his sexuality and whether she's attracted to him. \n\nShe mentions that their sex life isn't very frequent and she often initiates it. She starts feeling paranoid that maybe he's using her because he's actually gay. Then she breaks up with him but lies about the reason, telling him it's her personal issues. Later, she admits that the real reason was his bisexuality. \n\nSo the key points here are: The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which the author wasn't used to dealing with. She had reservations about his past interactions and felt there was a lack of mutual sexual attraction. She ended the relationship but hid the true reason, which could be seen as dishonest.\n\nNow, thinking about relationship norms. People have different boundaries and deal with their partner's past differently. If someone is open about their identity and the other person feels it's incompatible with their own needs, that's a valid reason to end a relationship. However, the author's hesitation might stem from her own discomfort with bisexuality, even if she claims she doesn't have an issue with it. \n\nAlso, if the relationship was already strained in terms of sexual compatibility, that's another factor. The author might be using the bisexuality as a catalyst for a decision she was already leaning towards. But the fact that she couldn't be honest with her partner about the real reason could be seen as a problem. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author has the right to her feelings and to end a relationship if she feels it's not working. But if the issue is more about her own biases or misunderstandings about bisexuality, that's where she might be at fault. The boyfriend disclosed something important, and the author had to process it. If she wasn't able to move past it despite her initial acceptance, then her decision, while personal, might not be entirely her fault. However, lying about the reason for the breakup could be seen as dishonest, which might affect her being in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the relationship was already struggling with intimacy, maybe the breakup is justified. The question is whether the author's reaction is based on genuine incompatibility or prejudice. Since she acknowledges she's never dated a non-straight person before, perhaps she isn't in the wrong for feeling that way, but she might need to reflect on her own biases. \n\nIn the \"Am I the Asshole?\" context, typically, if someone breaks up because of their partner's identity without it being a deal-breaker they discussed beforehand, they might be considered the asshole. But if the relationship was already having issues, it's more nuanced. The dishonesty in the breakup might tip the scales towards her being in the wrong. But given that the user is asking for a yes or no, and the options are A (yes) or B (no), I need to weigh these factors.\n"
