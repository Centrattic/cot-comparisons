Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author (a woman) broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual. He admitted to hooking up with guys before, but she's okay with people being gay or bi in general. However, she hadn't dated non-straight guys before, and she started feeling insecure about their sex life and whether he was using her to hide being gay. She ended the relationship but lied about the reason, saying it was her personal issues instead of his sexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether breaking up because someone is bisexual is wrong. The author says she's not opposed to people being bi, but her inexperience with dating non-straight guys made her uncomfortable. That's a personal issue, but is it a valid reason to break up? Well, relationships are based on mutual compatibility. If one partner's sexual orientation affects the other's comfort, maybe that's a problem. But bisexuality doesn't inherently mean someone is attracted to others during the relationship. However, the author's reasons might be more about insecurity or lack of chemistry rather than the bisexuality itself.\n\nThen there's the fact that the relationship wasn't super sexually active. The author initiated sex, and she started questioning if he wasn't even attracted to her. That part might be more about the relationship dynamics than his sexuality. The boyfriend might have been bi but not necessarily interested in women, which could explain the low sexual frequency. But that's speculative.\n\nThe author lied about the reason for the breakup, which might be a red flag. Honesty is important in relationships, so lying about why you break up could be seen as wrong. However, the main issue is whether the reason itself is valid. If she couldn't accept his bisexuality, even if she claims not to care, then maybe she is in the wrong. But if her real problem is the lack of attraction or connection, not his sexual orientation, then maybe she's justified in ending the relationship, even if she used his bisexuality as a catalyst.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend might have felt the need to come out first, and the author couldn't handle it, but that doesn't make her wrong. But if she was okay with bisexuality in general but not in her partner, that might be a double standard. However, personal feelings and insecurities can play a role here. The key is whether the breakup was based on his sexuality itself or other issues exacerbated by it.\n\nSo, putting it all together: If the author ended the relationship because he's bi, but she's okay with people being bi in general, that could be hypocritical. However, if her issue was that she felt he wasn't attracted to her and the bisexuality contributed to that insecurity, maybe it's more about relationship incompatibility. The lie about the reason for the breakup is a separate issue but might reflect on her honesty.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because her decision was based on personal incompatibility (lack of attraction and sexual chemistry) rather than prejudice against bisexuality. But there's an argument that she should have communicated her feelings instead of lying and breaking up. However, since she clarified that she's not opposed to bisexuality, perhaps her actions were about the relationship dynamics and not his identity. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
