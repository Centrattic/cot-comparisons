Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. She says she doesn't care about his sexuality, but she was taken aback because she's only dated straight guys. She felt insecure about the relationship, maybe thinking he's not attracted to her, and ended things by lying about the reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider whether her actions were justified. Bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation, and it's not something that should be a deal-breaker unless someone has a specific issue with it. However, the key here is that the boyfriend didn't hide his bisexuality in a way that was deceptive. He came out to her voluntarily, which shows some level of honesty. The fact that he had hooked up with guys before might be relevant if it's a recent thing or if it's something that's ongoing and affects their relationship dynamics, but the story doesn't mention that he was unfaithful during their relationship. \n\nThe author's main issue seems to be her own insecurities. She mentions that she initiated sex and that their frequency is low, which led her to question his attraction. But she admits she's not bothered by the frequency and that he compliments her. The problem might stem from her own feelings of not feeling desired in a way she expects. However, breaking up because of someone's sexual orientation, even if it's a personal struggle, could be seen as wrong because it's not about his actions but his identity.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone has the right to be in a relationship where both parties feel comfortable. If she felt that his bisexuality made her uncomfortable and she couldn't move past it despite his honesty, maybe leaving isn't the fault of the author. But the way she lied about the reason and didn't address the issue directly might be problematic. She didn't confront her feelings openly, which could have allowed for a more honest discussion. By breaking up and lying, she might have avoided a necessary conversation that could have clarified things or led to a mutual decision.\n\nHowever, since the question is about whether she's in the wrong, the main point is that the breakup was based on his sexuality, which is a personal choice and shouldn't be a reason to end a relationship. Unless there's deceit involved, like if he had hidden it to manipulate or lie, but here he was upfront. So the author's decision might be seen as her own personal issue rather than his wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong because it's her choice based on her comfort, but some might argue she's in the wrong for ending it over something that's not a betrayal. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) usually considers whether the person is being unfair or hypocritical. Since she admits she's not okay with it and chose to end it, maybe she's not the asshole, but she's also not right to lie about the reason. However, the core issue is his bisexuality, which is not a fault, so she's in the wrong for breaking up over it. Hmm, conflicting thoughts here.\n"
