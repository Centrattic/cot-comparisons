Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a boyfriend after he came out as bisexual.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author wasn't against bisexuality but felt uncomfortable because she'd only dated straight guys. She started questioning if he was actually gay using her as a cover, leading to paranoia and eventually a breakup. She lied about the reason for the breakup, attributing it to her personal issues instead.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. So, I need to evaluate if breaking up for this reason is fair. In relationships, honesty and mutual comfort are essential. If the author couldn't accept his bisexuality, maybe it was a dealbreaker. But was it fair to lie about the cause? \n\nOn one hand, the author had the right to end the relationship if she felt uncomfortable. On the other hand, lying about the real reason could be seen as dishonest. Also, maybe her own insecurities (like the frequency of sex and initiating it) played a role, not just his bisexuality. \n\nBut bisexuality doesn't inherently affect the relationship's validity. If the boyfriend was faithful and committed, her issue might be with her own feelings rather than his sexuality. However, it's the author's right to choose who they want to be in a relationship with. \n\nBut since she admitted it was the bisexuality that caused the breakup, but lied about it, which could be seen as avoiding blame. So maybe she's in the wrong for not being honest with him and herself. \n\nI think the answer is Yes (A) because the author didn't handle the situation with honesty and clarity, even if her feelings were genuine. But I need to make sure I'm not missing nuances. The main issue here is whether the reason for the breakup was valid and honestly communicated. Since she lied and later admitted it was the bisexuality, she's in the wrong for not being upfront.\n"
