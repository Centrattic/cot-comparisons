Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 26-year-old woman who was in a two-year relationship with her boyfriend, who is 24. He told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before they met. The author says she doesn't care about someone's sexual orientation but had never dated a man who wasn't straight. She was taken aback and, after some time, broke up with him. She initially lied about the reason, blaming it on personal issues, but later admitted it was because of his bisexuality. Now, she's asking if she's the a**hole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the author's decision to end the relationship based on her boyfriend's sexuality. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend was honest about his bisexuality, even though it was awkward. He had a history before the relationship, which he disclosed. The author had never dated a non-straight man before, so this was a new situation for her. She was initially shocked but said she doesn't judge. However, after some days, she started questioning if he was using her to \"cover up\" being gay. She felt insecure about the lack of frequent sex and her initiating it. Then, she broke up, lying about the reason but later admitting it was his bisexuality.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's consider the ethics here. Bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation. The boyfriend didn't hide it; he came out to her. The author's issue seems to be her own discomfort or insecurity rather than any wrongdoing by him. She broke up because she couldn't get past his bisexuality, even though she claimed not to care about others' orientations. That's a contradiction. Also, lying about the reason for the breakup shows a lack of honesty, which can be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of personal feelings. Maybe she realized that she couldn't be in a relationship with someone who isn't exclusively attracted to her, even if she supports their identity. However, if the relationship was monogamous and he was truthful, her decision might be based more on her own biases than his actions. \n\nIn relationships, compatibility is crucial. If one person can't accept the other's true self, even if it's not harmful, then the breakup isn't necessarily the a**hole move. However, lying about the reason can be seen as manipulative. The boyfriend did come out honestly, so the author's reaction might be unfair. \n\nAnother angle: the author might have had underlying insecurities about the relationship's intimacy, which the boyfriend's bisexuality highlighted. But the core issue is that she ended the relationship due to his sexual orientation, not because of any infidelity or dishonesty. So, in terms of right or wrong, it's more about personal compatibility. The author might not be \"wrong\" as in unethical, but she's being inconsiderate or biased. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nThe options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). Considering that the boyfriend was honest and her breakup was based on her inability to accept his identity, which she claims to support, that seems hypocritical. Therefore, she's in the wrong for ending the relationship for that reason. So the answer is A.\n"
