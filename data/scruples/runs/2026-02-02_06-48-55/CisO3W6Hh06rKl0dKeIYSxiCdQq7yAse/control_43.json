Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe author (26M) broke up with his 24-year-old girlfriend after he confessed he's bisexual. The key points are that he told her he's bi and had hooked up with guys before. The author says he doesn't care about her orientation but is unsure because he's never dated someone not straight. They don't have sex often, and when they do, she initiates. He started questioning if she's using him, even though he said he's not bothered by the frequency. He ended the relationship, but he lied about the reason, saying it was personal stuff instead of her sexuality. He admits that if he hadn't told her, they'd still be together.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me break it down. First, she revealed her sexuality, which he found surprising. He claims it's not about her orientation but about the fact that he might be gay and using her. But he's the one who ended the relationship because of her sexuality, even though he denied it. Also, he lied about the reason for the breakup, which might be a red flag. \n\nIn relationships, honesty and compatibility are key. If he couldn't accept her bisexuality, even if he says he does, then maybe it's not a deal-breaker for him, but he let it affect his feelings. However, he's not in a position to judge her orientation. Also, the fact that he ended it because he questioned his own sexuality, not hers, is a bit confusing. The lie about the reason for the breakup adds another layer of dishonesty. \n\nOn one hand, people can have issues with their partner's past before the relationship. On the other hand, if the main issue is her being bi and not him being straight, and he can't accept that, even if he says he can, then he might be the one with the problem. The fact that he's the one who broke up but then blamed it on something else suggests he might be in the wrong because the real issue was her sexuality, which shouldn't matter if he's supposed to accept her for who she is. \n\nBut wait, the post says he's the one who broke up. Wait, no, the user is the one asking if they're in the wrong. Wait, the user is the boyfriend (26M) who broke up with his girlfriend (24F) after she told him she's bi. The user is male, and the ex is female. So the user is the one who broke up the relationship. The user is asking if he's in the wrong. \n\nSo the key here is that the user ended the relationship because his girlfriend is bisexual. He claims he doesn't care, but his actions show he does. The fact that he couldn't accept her past hookups with men and started questioning if she's using him, leading to the breakup, suggests that his real issue is her bisexuality. Even though he says he's not bothered by the frequency of sex, the fact that the breakup was because of her orientation is problematic. \n\nIn relationships, if someone can't accept their partner's sexuality, even if they claim they can, that's a problem. The lie about the reason for the breakup also shows dishonesty. Therefore, the user is in the wrong because he ended the relationship over his girlfriend's bisexuality, which she should not have to hide or change for. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
