Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a 24-year-old woman in a two-year relationship with a 26-year-old boyfriend. He came out as bisexual, admitting he had hooked up with guys before. She says she doesn't care about someone's sexuality, but she's been in relationships only with straight guys. The breakup happened because she felt he might be using her to cover being gay, and she couldn't get past it, even though they had a low sex frequency and she usually initiates. She lied about the reason for the breakup, blaming personal issues instead of his bisexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are her reaction to his bisexuality and the circumstances of the breakup. The boyfriend was honest about his bisexuality, which he disclosed before the breakup. The author's main issue isn't with his sexuality itself but with the possibility that he's not truly attracted to her and that he's using her to hide his true orientation. However, she's never felt lust from him during their relationship, even though he compliments her appearance.\n\nBisexuality means being attracted to both genders, so if he's bi, being with her shouldn't mean he's \"covering up\" being gay. But the author's feelings are based on her perception that his bisexuality might be a facade for being gay. It's important to note that the boyfriend's actions (initiating sex, complimenting her) might contradict her assumptions. The author decided to break up because of her insecurities rather than discussing them openly. She lied about the reason, which could be a red flag for dishonesty in the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should be honest and compatible in their expectations. The boyfriend was truthful about his identity, which is a responsible action. The author's discomfort stems from her own biases or lack of experience with non-straight partners. By breaking up and lying, she might be avoiding the real issue, which is her acceptance of his sexuality. The question is whether her decision to end the relationship was justified. While everyone has the right to their boundaries, the core of the issue is her inability to accept his bisexuality as genuine, leading to a breakup based on her insecurities rather than the boyfriend's actions. \n\nSo, the author's wrong might be in not being honest about her feelings and the real reason for the breakup, rather than the bisexuality itself. Her actions could be seen as using the personal stuff as an excuse, which isn't fair to her partner. The boyfriend was up front, and the author's decision was based on her own doubts and not the actual behavior that would indicate dishonesty or manipulation. Therefore, she might be in the wrong for not addressing her feelings directly and for ending the relationship without clear cause beyond her own reservations about his sexuality.\n"
