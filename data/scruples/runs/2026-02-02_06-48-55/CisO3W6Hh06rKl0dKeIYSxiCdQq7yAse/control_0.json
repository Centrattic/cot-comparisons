Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author says she doesn't care about his orientation, but she's never dated someone not straight. She was taken aback and then started questioning their relationship. Their sex life was infrequent, she usually initiates, and she felt there wasn't much lust. She broke up with him, but later admitted it was because of his bisexuality, even though she told him it was personal stuff.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about compatibility and honesty. The boyfriend came out voluntarily, which shows he felt the need to be honest. The author's reaction was to end the relationship, which she later admitted was because of his sexuality, even though she initially lied about the reason. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners are comfortable with each other's identities. If someone's sexual orientation is a deal-breaker for the other, then they might not be compatible. However, the author's reasoning here is that she couldn't get past his bisexuality, even though she claims she doesn't judge people for it. But her actions contradict that. \n\nBut wait, maybe she's in a monogamous relationship and his bisexuality made her question his attraction to her. However, bisexuality doesn't mean he's not attracted to her. The fact that he's bisexual doesn't inherently make him less interested in her. The author's insecurity might be the bigger issue here. \n\nAlso, she broke up with him after he was honest with her. If she couldn't accept his identity, maybe she was in the wrong. But relationships are about mutual compatibility. If she can't accept his bisexuality, then maybe it's not her fault. But the way she ended it by lying might complicate things. \n\nOn the other hand, he came clean, and she had the choice to stay or leave. If his bisexuality made her uncomfortable in the relationship, then she's not wrong for leaving. However, if the issue was his past actions (hooking up with guys) rather than his current orientation, then maybe she's overreacting. \n\nThe main question is whether her decision was justified. Since she admitted it was his bisexuality that caused the breakup, and she couldn't accept it, even though she claims she's not judgmental, it's a contradiction. But in relationships, personal boundaries vary. If someone's core identity makes the other partner uncomfortable, then the decision to break up is their right. However, the way she handled it\u2014by lying about the reason\u2014might not be fair to him. But the core issue is whether she's in the wrong for breaking up over his sexuality. \n\nIn the AITA context, usually, being judgmental about someone's sexuality is frowned upon. Since bisexuality is valid and the author couldn't accept it, she might be in the wrong. But if the problem was the initial hookups he mentioned, that's different. But he said he had hooked up with guys before her, not during the relationship. So if the issue is his orientation, which he disclosed, she's choosing not to be in the relationship because of that. If that's the case, maybe she's not wrong because she can't force herself to be in a relationship where she's uncomfortable. However, society often views this as being judgmental, which could put her in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because she broke up with him over his bisexuality, which is a personal choice and not a deal-breaker in itself. She's allowing her personal discomfort, despite claiming not to be judgmental, to end the relationship, which could be seen as hypocritical and unfair. However, it's also valid for her to realize they're not compatible. But in AITA terms, they often take the stance that being judgmental about sexuality is wrong.\n"
