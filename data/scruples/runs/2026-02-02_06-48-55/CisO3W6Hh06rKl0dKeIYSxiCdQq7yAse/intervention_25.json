Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend came out to her as bisexual after two years of dating. The key point here is whether the author had any prior knowledge about his sexuality. The boyfriend admitted to hooking up with guys before they met, but the author claims she's never dated a non-straight person. However, she didn't question his sexuality before. Now, she's breaking up because of this, even though she says she doesn't care about his orientation. But her actions suggest otherwise.\n\nNext, the frequency of their sex life is mentioned. They don't have sex often, and she usually initiates. She's questioning if he's even attracted to her. Wait, but if he's bisexual, that doesn't mean he's not attracted to her. The problem here is her own insecurities or assumptions about his bisexuality leading to a lack of attraction. But bisexuality means attraction to both genders, so he should be attracted to her. However, maybe she's conflating bisexuality with not being fully into the relationship with her. \n\nThe author is lying about the reason for the breakup. She says it's personal stuff, but it's really because of his bisexuality. That's a big deal. If she can't accept his identity, even though she claims she does, then the breakup is based on a core aspect of his identity. In a healthy relationship, both partners should accept each other's identities. If the author can't accept his bisexuality, that's a valid reason to end the relationship, but she's lying about it. However, the problem is that she's denying her own feelings and lying to him. But is she in the wrong for breaking up because of this? \n\nOn one hand, she's ending the relationship because of something she says she's okay with, which seems contradictory. On the other, if she can't accept his sexuality, even if she says she does, then the breakup is justified. However, lying about the reason and not being honest with him is problematic. But the main issue is whether she's in the wrong for breaking up because of his bisexuality. \n\nIn many cases, people break up for various reasons, even if they're not the most \"right\" reasons. If she can't accept his sexuality despite her initial claims, then she's prioritizing her own comfort over his honesty. But bisexuality is a valid identity, and if she can't accept that, maybe it's not a dealbreaker. However, if she's uncomfortable with his past actions (hooking up with guys before) even though they happened before the relationship, that's different. But the main issue here is the disclosure leading to her insecurities. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because she's breaking up over something she claims to accept, and lying about the reason. She should have addressed her feelings honestly and communicated them. Her actions show that she wasn't truly accepting of his bisexuality, which is a problem. So the answer would be A (Yes, she's in the wrong). But maybe some might argue she's not because she's allowed to have her feelings. Hmm. It's a bit nuanced. But given the situation, the fact that she's lying and not being honest about the real reason, and breaking up over something she said she could accept, I think she's in the wrong.\n"
