Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup after the boyfriend came out as bisexual. The author broke up with him because she couldn't get past the fact that he had hooked up with guys before. She claims she doesn't care about his sexuality, but the breakup was because she started doubting his attraction to her and felt he might be using her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend came out as bisexual, which he had apparently known before the relationship. The author was surprised and started questioning their relationship dynamics. She ended the relationship, but she admits it was because of his bisexuality, even though she told him it was for other reasons.\n\nNow, in terms of right or wrong. There's a principle that people have the right to their own sexuality, and coming out shouldn't be a dealbreaker unless it's a matter of personal values. However, the author felt uncomfortable and couldn't move past it, which is her own feeling. But if the boyfriend was honest from the start, maybe the author's issue was more about her own insecurities or unmet expectations rather than the bisexuality itself. \n\nBisexuality is a valid sexual orientation, and it's not fair to end a relationship solely because someone is bisexual unless it's a dealbreaker for the other person. The author's reasoning seems based on insecurity about attraction and frequency of sex, which might not be directly caused by his bisexuality. However, she did admit that his disclosure led her to question everything. \n\nThe boyfriend did come clean, which is important. The author's decision to break up, even if it's based on her feelings, might be seen as her right, but if she knew upfront about his bisexuality, maybe she wouldn't have started the relationship. But since he only disclosed later, it's a different scenario. The problem is that she ended it because of something he revealed, which is his own identity. \n\nIn terms of fault, the author is making a choice based on her own comfort, but if she can't accept his bisexuality, then breaking up isn't necessarily wrong. However, if she had known from the start and still chose to be with him, then breaking up later might be more complicated. But in this case, he came out to her, and she couldn't handle it. So maybe she's not in the wrong because it's her right to end the relationship if his identity is a problem for her. But some might argue that she shouldn't end it based on something he didn't hide and is a part of him. \n\nAlternatively, if the author had issues with attraction and frequency before his coming out, maybe the bisexuality was just a catalyst. But the key point is that she couldn't get past it. The answer might be A (she's in the wrong) if the issue is about accepting his identity, or B (not in the wrong) because it's her choice. \n\nI think the answer is A because the author is ending the relationship based on something that is a core part of his identity, which he disclosed. If she had issues with that after knowing, it's her choice, but if the problem is his bisexuality itself, then she is in the wrong. Since she admits the breakup was due to his bisexuality, even if she denies it, then she's making a choice based on his identity, which is not acceptable. So the answer is A.\n"
