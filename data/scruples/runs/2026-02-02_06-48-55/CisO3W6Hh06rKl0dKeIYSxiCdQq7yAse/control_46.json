Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who broke up their boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend came out as bisexual, which the author didn't expect because they had only dated straight guys before. The author then broke up, but they admitted it was because of his bisexuality, even though they told him it was their own personal stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author had a valid reason. The user says they don't care about someone's orientation, but they're confused because their BF's past hookups with guys made them question his attraction. The author felt he wasn't into them, even though he compliments them. But is that a valid reason to break up?\n\nWell, in relationships, communication and compatibility are key. The author might have felt uncomfortable knowing he's bi, even though he didn't act on it during their relationship. Maybe they felt it was a deal-breaker for them. But the BF came clean, which shows honesty. The author's lie about the reason for the breakup could be a problem because they didn't address the real issue. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they were a little taken aback but don't care about his orientation. But their actions suggest otherwise. They broke up because of his bisexuality, even if they didn't want to admit it. So maybe they're in the wrong for not being honest about their feelings and breaking up based on something they hadn't considered before. \n\nOn the other hand, the BF didn't cheat or hide it; he just came out. The author might have realized that their relationship wasn't working for other reasons, and his bisexuality was the catalyst. But if the author can't accept his orientation, even if he's faithful, that's a problem. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up over his sexuality when they said it's okay. Since they admitted it was the main reason, maybe they are in the wrong. But people have different deal-breakers. If the author isn't comfortable with a partner having attractions to others, even if they don't act on it, that's their choice. However, being honest about the real reason is important. The author lying about the cause could mean they're in the wrong because they didn't address the real issue. \n\nHmm. So the answer might be that they are not in the wrong (B) because they had the right to decide their deal-breakers, even if it's unexpected. But if they lied about the reason, maybe they are in the wrong. Wait, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether breaking up over someone's sexuality is justified. Since the user said they don't care about orientation but ended up breaking up because of it, maybe they are in the wrong for not being honest with themselves and their partner. So the answer could be A (yes, they're in the wrong). But I'm a bit confused here. Let me check again.\n\nThe key points: The BF came out honestly. The author broke up because they couldn't handle his bisexuality, even though they claimed to not care. They lied about the reason. The author's reaction was based on their own discomfort, not any action from the BF. In relationships, if one's values or boundaries are violated, it's okay to leave. If the author's issue is with his bisexuality, even if he's faithful, maybe they are not in the wrong. However, if they didn't realize it was the real reason and lied about it, maybe they are in the wrong for not being honest. But the main issue is whether the breakup was justified. If the author can't accept their partner's sexuality, even if he's not acting on it, then they are in the wrong. Because coming out is not a betrayal. So the answer is A (they are in the wrong). Wait, but people have different boundaries. If the author can't accept bisexuality, even if he's not cheating, then it's their choice. But the author said they don't care, so maybe they're lying to themselves. So the answer might be A because they broke up based on something they claimed not to care about and lied about the reason. So the answer is A.\n"
