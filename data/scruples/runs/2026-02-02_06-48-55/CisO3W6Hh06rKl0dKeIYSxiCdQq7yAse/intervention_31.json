Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. She doesn't care about his sexuality, but she's concerned because they haven't had sex often, she usually initiates, and she thinks he might be using her to cover being gay. She ended the relationship, but admitted it was because of his bisexuality, even though she told him it was due to her own issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The boyfriend came out as bisexual, which the author states she's okay with in general. However, she's uncomfortable because of their sexual frequency and her suspicion that he's not attracted to her. Her breakup was based on his sexuality, even though she told him it was for other reasons. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's at fault. From a moral standpoint, breaking up because someone is bisexual could be problematic. Bisexuality is a valid orientation, and the author's discomfort stems from assumptions about his sexual activity and her own insecurities about attraction. The boyfriend didn't do anything wrong by coming out. The author made the decision to end things based on his identity, which is not something he can control. \n\nHowever, relationships are about mutual compatibility. If the author felt that her needs weren't being met, maybe there's some nuance. But in this case, the primary reason given is his sexuality, which shouldn't be a deal-breaker unless there's infidelity or deception. The boyfriend was upfront, so the author's decision to end things is her choice, but the fact that she blamed him for something he disclosed honestly might make her the one at fault. \n\nAlso, her reasoning about his lack of attraction could be her projecting or misunderstanding. She admitted he compliments her, and the issue might be her own feelings of not feeling desired. But she's using his bisexuality as a reason, which is a personal choice, but not necessarily wrong. However, the fact that she's in the wrong if she's breaking up based on his sexuality when he was honest and she's the one who decided it wasn't compatible. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, if someone is ending a relationship due to something that the other person honestly disclosed, the person ending it is often not in the wrong because it's their choice. But if the reason is based on stereotypes or prejudices, then they might be. Here, the author says she doesn't care about sexuality but was surprised. Her real issue might be her own insecurities and misinterpretations. \n\nBut the key is that the boyfriend was truthful. If the author couldn't accept his bisexuality despite saying she's okay with it, that makes her the one in the wrong. Alternatively, if she's making a choice based on her own needs, maybe not. But given that she's breaking up because of his identity, not because of actions or behaviors, it's likely she's the one at fault here.\n"
