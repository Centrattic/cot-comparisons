Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. She says she doesn't care about someone's sexuality, but she's never dated a non-straight guy before. She was taken aback, but the main issue seems to be that after he told her, she started doubting whether he was even attracted to her, leading her to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The boyfriend came out as bisexual. Bisexuality means being attracted to more than one gender, but it doesn't necessarily mean he's not attracted to women. The fact that he had hooked up with guys before might have made the author question his attraction to her, but that's her own insecurity or assumption. The key here is whether her reaction is fair.\n\nThe author claims she doesn't care about his sexuality, but her actions suggest that it was a deal-breaker. She broke up with him because of his bisexuality, even though she admitted he's a great person. She lied about the reason for the breakup, which might indicate she felt guilty. However, relationships are about mutual comfort and compatibility. If she couldn't accept his past experiences or felt insecure about his sexuality, then maybe she's not in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend didn't hide his sexuality; he came out to her. If the author couldn't accept that aspect of him, even if she says she doesn't care, then it's her choice. But is it wrong to break up because of someone's bisexuality? Not necessarily. People have different deal-breakers. However, the author might be in the wrong if the real issue was her own insecurities or if she judged him unfairly. But since she stated that she's okay with people being whatever, but this was a personal issue for her, it's more about compatibility.\n\nAlso, the frequency of sex and her initiating might be separate issues, but she's using the bisexuality as a catalyst. She might be projecting her own discomfort onto the situation. Since she's the one who ended the relationship, and the reason was his sexuality, it's a personal choice. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. In relationships, people have the right to their own boundaries. If being with a bisexual partner wasn't something she could accept, then breaking up isn't wrong. However, if she's acting on prejudice or misunderstanding, then maybe she is. But the story doesn't show her being prejudiced; more like dealing with her own insecurities. So, the answer might be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
