Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. The user is asking if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The boyfriend told her he's bi and had hooked up with guys before. The author says she doesn't care about someone's sexuality, but she was taken aback because she's only dated straight guys. She broke up because she started questioning if he was using her to cover being gay and wasn't really attracted to her. She admitted lying about the real reason for the breakup.\n\nNow, thinking about relationships, one important aspect is communication and mutual respect. If someone's sexuality is discovered after a long-term relationship, it's important how both parties handle it. The boyfriend was honest about his bisexuality. The author, while stating she doesn't judge, felt unable to move past it. \n\nBut is that her problem? If she can't accept his sexuality, then maybe the breakup is her way of dealing with her own discomfort. However, breaking up because of something she didn't address or discuss might be abrupt. Did she give him a chance to explain or work through it together? \n\nAlso, the author mentions that their sexual frequency was low and she had to initiate, which might have contributed to her doubts. But the break-up was directly tied to his coming out. Maybe she conflated her own insecurities with his sexuality. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if someone can't accept their partner's sexuality, even if they don't judge, it's a personal issue. But the boyfriend had already disclosed his bisexuality. The author's decision could be seen as unfair because she didn't handle it by discussing her feelings instead of ending the relationship immediately. However, if she felt his bisexuality made her question his attraction to her, maybe she had valid concerns. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should be compatible in values and comfort with each other's traits. If the author can't accept bisexuality, even if she says she's okay, maybe the breakup is her way of finding compatibility. But the way she handled it\u2014lying about the reason\u2014could be seen as dishonest. \n\nOverall, the key points are honesty and mutual acceptance. The boyfriend was honest. The author didn't address her feelings openly but broke up, which might be her being in the wrong for not communicating properly. Alternatively, if she felt it was a deal-breaker, maybe she's not in the wrong. But typically, breaking up due to something that was discussed and accepted (if possible) might be her fault. But she admitted she couldn't get past it, which is her personal issue. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But I'm a bit split here. The answer might depend on whether not accepting the partner's sexuality is a deal-breaker, which is subjective. Since she didn't try to work through it, maybe she's in the wrong. Or since she's not a bigot, maybe not. Hmm.\n"
