Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. She claims she's not judgmental about sexuality but was taken aback because she's only dated straight guys. After the conversation, she started questioning if he's gay and using her to hide it, leading to her breaking up, but she lied about the reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend came out as bisexual and admitted to past relationships with men. The author's main issue seems to be discomfort with his bisexuality, even though she says she's okay with it. She ended the relationship because of his sexuality, even though she tried to blame personal issues. \n\nBisexuality means being attracted to both genders, so past relationships with men don't necessarily mean he's not into her. But the author started doubting his attraction to her, leading to the breakup. The question is if she's in the wrong for that. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to be comfortable with each other's identities. However, breaking up solely because of someone's orientation, even if it's not directly a problem with them as a person, might be an issue. The author's discomfort led her to end the relationship, even though she admitted she's okay with it in general. That seems contradictory. Also, lying about the reason for the breakup could be seen as not being honest. \n\nOn the other hand, people have the right to their own preferences. If the author can't accept that her partner is bisexual, even if he's committed to her, maybe the breakup is because of a fundamental incompatibility. But if she's not actually opposed to bisexuality, but her insecurities led her to break up, that's a personal issue. \n\nSo, is she wrong? If the problem is that she couldn't accept his bisexuality and that led to the breakup, even if she claims she's okay with it, maybe she is in the wrong because she's acting against her stated beliefs. However, if her insecurities are valid and she felt that his bisexuality affected their relationship dynamics (like lack of sex, initiating sex), then it's more about her personal feelings. But the main issue is the breakup reason. Since she admitted that his bisexuality was the real reason, and she lied about it, that might make her wrong because she's not being truthful and is ending the relationship for a reason she claims she's okay with. \n\nSo I think the answer is A, she is in the wrong because she couldn't accept his bisexuality despite saying she supports it, leading her to end the relationship under false pretenses.\n"
