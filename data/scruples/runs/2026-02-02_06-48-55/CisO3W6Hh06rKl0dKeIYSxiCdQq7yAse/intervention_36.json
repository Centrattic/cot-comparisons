Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend for being bisexual is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend came out as bisexual and admitted to having hooked up with guys before. The author says they don't care about someone's sexuality but were taken aback because they'd only dated straight guys. They mention that their relationship didn't have much physical intimacy, and they started questioning if he was using them to hide his true orientation. Eventually, they broke up but blamed personal issues instead of the real reason.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation, and coming out can be a personal decision. The boyfriend chose to be honest, which is generally healthy in a relationship. The author's issue isn't with lying or deceit but with the boyfriend's sexuality itself. They admitted that the breakup was directly because he's bi, even though they made an excuse. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners are comfortable with each other's identities. If one person can't accept the other's sexuality, that might be a legitimate reason to end the relationship. However, there's also a consideration about whether the author acted with honesty. By not being upfront about the real reason for the breakup, they might have been dishonest, which could be seen as inconsiderate. But if the root issue is the boyfriend's sexuality, which the author isn't comfortable with despite not caring about others' orientations, it's a personal conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend had a right to be open about his identity. The author's decision might stem from insecurity or unmet expectations about the relationship's dynamics (like lack of sex), which they projected onto his bisexuality. It's possible they're conflating his sexuality with other issues in the relationship.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the boyfriend was honest, and the author's issue is with his sexuality, it's a matter of compatibility. However, the deception in the breakup (lying about the reason) complicates things. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just the breakup itself. If the author couldn't accept his bisexuality, then the breakup is about their own feelings, not his actions. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship if it's about personal incompatibility, but they could be wrong in not being honest about the reason. However, the main question is whether the breakup itself was wrong because of his bisexuality. Since bisexuality isn't inherently a reason for a breakup unless it's causing specific issues (like infidelity), but here the author's discomfort is the issue. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong, because the author's feelings are valid, even if they could have handled the breakup more honestly.\n"
