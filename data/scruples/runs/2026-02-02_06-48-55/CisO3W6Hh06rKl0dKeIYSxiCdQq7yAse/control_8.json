Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend came out as bisexual, and the author ended the relationship because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend had a two-year relationship, and during that time, they didn't have sex often, with the author initiating most times. The author doesn't care about bisexuality in general but felt something was off after the confession. The boyfriend admitted to hooking up with men before the relationship, which started making the author question if he's using the relationship to hide his true sexuality. The author then breaks up, lying about the reason. The boyfriend thinks the break-up is due to his sexuality, which the author denies but later admits it was a factor.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is whether the author is wrong to end the relationship based on the boyfriend's bisexuality. The user wants to know if the author is at fault. \n\nI should consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author felt uncomfortable after learning about the boyfriend's past. They mention they don't judge people for their sexuality, but still felt uneasy. The author's reasoning for breaking up is because the boyfriend's bisexuality made them question if he was truly attracted to them. However, the author also admitted that if the boyfriend hadn't come out, they'd still be together, implying the bisexuality was the direct cause.\n\nNow, in relationships, it's important that both partners feel comfortable and accepted. If the author felt that the boyfriend's bisexuality was a significant issue for them, even if they don't personally judge, it might be a deal-breaker. But is it fair to end the relationship over someone's sexuality, especially if they claim not to have an issue with it? \n\nThe boyfriend came out to the author, which is a step towards honesty. The author's reaction was to lie about the reason for the breakup, which might be seen as unfair. However, the author's feelings are valid. If they can't be comfortable in the relationship due to this, it's understandable. The problem is the author's justification for breaking up while lying about it, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Breaking up because of something that makes you uncomfortable isn't inherently wrong. The key is whether the author is respecting the boyfriend's identity. However, if the author had no problem with bisexuality in general but couldn't accept their partner being bi, that might be a personal issue. Also, the author's reasons for the breakup were based on their own insecurities and doubts, which they admitted were not directly about the boyfriend's bisexuality but rather their perception of his attraction.\n\nIn some perspectives, ending a relationship because of something that the person isn't responsible for (like their sexuality) might be seen as wrong. But if the author can't be in a relationship with a bisexual partner, even if they don't judge others, it's their right to leave. However, the way they handled it (lying about the reason) complicates things. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't wrong because they had legitimate feelings and needed to be honest with themselves. But the fact that they denied the real reason initially might make others see it as inconsiderate. \n\nI think the answer here is that the author isn't in the wrong because they ended the relationship based on their own discomfort, which is valid. However, they handled it poorly by lying, but the core reason (breaking up over bisexuality) isn't necessarily wrong if it's a deal-breaker for them. But some might argue that bisexuality itself shouldn't be a deal-breaker if they don't have an issue with it. So it's a bit tricky. The answer could go either way, but in the context of the question, the author's actions are not in the wrong because they are prioritizing their own feelings and needs, even if others might judge them for it.\n"
