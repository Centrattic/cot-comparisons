Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he confessed he's bisexual. Hmm.\n\nSo the situation is that the boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author doesn't care about orientation but got uncomfortable. They had a two-year relationship with infrequent and initiated by her sex. She broke up with him, lying about the real reason.\n\nFirst, maybe I should consider the basics of relationships. People can have different orientations, and if the author didn't have an issue with it in general, why was it a problem here? Maybe she felt insecure or unsure about his feelings for her. But breaking up just because he's bi? That might be problematic. Bisexuality is valid, and his past actions don't necessarily mean he's not into her. But she might have felt he wasn't fully into the relationship, leading to her decision.\n\nThen there's the aspect of honesty. The boyfriend came out to her, which requires trust. She lied about the breakup reason, which could be seen as unfair. If she couldn't handle his orientation, maybe the breakup was justified for her well-being, but lying adds complexity. \n\nAlso, the relationship's dynamics: low sex frequency and her initiating might indicate other issues. But she attributes it to his sexuality. Maybe she didn't address her concerns directly or communicate properly. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's subjective. She had the right to end the relationship if it wasn't working for her. However, the way she handled it by lying might not be fair to him. But the core issue is if his bisexuality made her feel uncomfortable enough to leave, which could be her personal choice. \n\nSo, the answer is tricky. If she's in the wrong, it's because she didn't confront her feelings honestly. If not, it's about her right to choose a partner she feels compatible with. I think I lean towards A, but I'm not 100% sure. The AITA community often considers the validity of reasons but also the honesty in the breakup. Lying about the reason might make her in the wrong.\n"
