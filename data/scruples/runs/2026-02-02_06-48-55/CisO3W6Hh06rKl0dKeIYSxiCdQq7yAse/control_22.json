Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. They labeled it as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The boyfriend confessed he's bisexual and had previously hooked up with men. The author is a woman who's been with him for two years. She clarifies she's not against bisexuality, but she's never dated a non-straight guy before. After his confession, she started doubting their relationship, especially since their sex life isn't frequent and she usually initiates. She ended up breaking up with him, but lied about the real reason, saying it was personal issues instead of his bisexuality.\n\nThe key points here are the author's feelings upon learning about his bisexuality, the impact on her relationship, and the decision to break up. She admits that if he hadn't come out, they'd still be together. So, the question is whether she's in the wrong for ending the relationship because of his sexuality.\n\nBisexuality is a valid sexual orientation, and being in a monogamous relationship with a bisexual partner isn't inherently a problem. However, the author's feelings and comfort in the relationship are also important. If she's not comfortable knowing her partner is bisexual and that he's had relationships with men, that's a personal issue. But is it wrong to end a relationship because of that?\n\nThe person who came out did what's right by being honest. The author's reaction, while maybe influenced by insecurity or lack of experience, is a personal choice. She's not obligated to stay in a relationship that makes her uncomfortable. However, some might argue that her reaction is problematic because she's ending it based on his sexuality rather than any actual betrayal or issue. On the other hand, if the relationship wasn't fulfilling for her (due to lack of connection or other factors), her decision could be justified.\n\nI should also consider the aspect of trust and communication. The boyfriend came out to her, which is a significant step. Her response was to break up and lie about the reason, which might be seen as dishonest. But her reason for the breakup was based on her own emotions and insecurities. \n\nIn terms of social norms, some people might say that it's not the author's fault if she can't accept a bisexual partner, especially if she's not had prior experience. Others might say she's in the wrong because bisexuality doesn't inherently affect the relationship negatively, and ending it for that reason is unfair.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship because her partner is bisexual. The key factors are her personal feelings, the honesty of the partner, and the dynamics of their relationship. Since the partner was open about his sexuality and the author felt it affected her comfort, it's a matter of personal choice and acceptance. But if the breakup was solely based on his bisexuality without other issues, some might argue she's in the wrong for not accepting his orientation. However, others might see it as her being honest with her feelings and ending a relationship that no longer suited her needs.\n"
