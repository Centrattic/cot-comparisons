Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who broke up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. The context is that the boyfriend had hooked up with guys before them, and the breakup was because she couldn't get past his bisexuality.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author states she doesn't care about being gay or bi, but she's never dated a guy who wasn't straight. She was taken aback by his confession. Then she started questioning if he's gay using her as a cover, leading to paranoia. She broke up, but lied about the reason.\n\nNow, the main question is whether she was wrong. On one hand, she had the right to feel uncomfortable and to make decisions based on her own boundaries. If she couldn't accept his bisexuality, even if she says she doesn't judge, her actions show she couldn't move past it. Relationships require mutual acceptance, and if one partner's identity is a deal-breaker for the other, it's hard to continue.\n\nBut then, breaking up over something that the partner disclosed honestly? The boyfriend came out to her when he felt ready. If she was okay with it, they could have discussed and worked through it. However, she didn't communicate her feelings and instead lied about the reason for the breakup. That's dishonest and could be seen as a problem.\n\nAlso, considering her personal boundaries. If she realized that his bisexuality made her uncomfortable to the point of doubting his attraction to her, maybe it's valid for her to step back. But lying about the reason for breaking up might be where she's in the wrong. Honesty is crucial in relationships, so not being truthful about her feelings could harm trust, even if the relationship is ending.\n\nAnother angle: bisexuality is a valid orientation. The boyfriend didn't hide his past, and he came out to her. If the author can't accept that, maybe the breakup is more about her own insecurities or boundaries. But people have the right to choose their partners based on their own comfort.\n\nBut the key issue here is the dishonesty. She told him it was about her personal issues instead of his sexuality. That's a lie, which could be seen as her being in the wrong. Even if her feelings were genuine, honesty is important. She should have been upfront about her inability to accept his sexuality, even if that meant the relationship couldn't work.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's decision to break up might be understandable due to her personal boundaries, but lying about the reason is where she's in the wrong. She should have communicated her true feelings instead of fabricating a reason. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, she's in the wrong) because of the dishonesty, even if the breakup itself isn't the issue.\n"
