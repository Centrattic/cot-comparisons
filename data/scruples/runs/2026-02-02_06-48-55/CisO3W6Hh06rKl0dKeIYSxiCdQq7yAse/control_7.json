Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he disclosed he's bisexual. She mentions that she doesn't care about his sexuality in general but was taken aback because she's only dated straight guys. She also felt uncertain about their relationship dynamics, like the low frequency of sex and her usually initiating it, which made her question if he's even attracted to her. Then she decided to break up, but lied about the reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if breaking up because of his bisexuality is wrong. The question is whether it's acceptable for her to end the relationship for that reason. The key points here are mutual respect and personal boundaries. If the author's deal-breaker was his bisexuality, even though she claims she's accepting of it, then she's in the right to leave. However, if she's reacting to the fact that he had past relationships with men, which he disclosed, but that's not something he can change, maybe she should have addressed it earlier.\n\nAlso, the author admitted that the breakup was because of his bisexuality, even though she told him it was personal stuff. Deception here might play a role. But in terms of being in the wrong, if the breakup was consensual and he's accepting it, maybe not. However, some might argue that she should have been honest with herself and him about her feelings.\n\nAnother angle: The author's insecurities about the relationship's dynamics (sex frequency, initiating) might have contributed. She might have used his bisexuality as a reason to end the relationship because of her own unresolved issues. But the fact remains that his sexuality was a direct cause for the breakup.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, being bisexual isn't a reason to break up. But in a relationship, if one partner's core values or deal-breakers are not aligned, it's their right to leave. However, if she's only just realizing this after two years, maybe there's a question about her own clarity in the relationship. But she's not in the wrong for having different needs or boundaries, even if they were discovered later.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong if she had a legitimate reason to end the relationship. The fact that she's honest about her reasoning now (even if she lied to him) shows that she's taking responsibility. The main issue is whether the reason is valid. Since relationships are based on mutual compatibility, if bisexuality is a deal-breaker for her, even if it's not about discrimination, she's not in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
