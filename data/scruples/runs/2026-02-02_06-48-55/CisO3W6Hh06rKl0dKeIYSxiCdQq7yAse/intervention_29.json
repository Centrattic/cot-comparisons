Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation from both sides.\n\nThe boyfriend came out as bisexual, mentioning he had hookups with guys before. The author says she doesn't care about his orientation, but she's conflicted because she's never dated a non-straight guy. She's breaking up because she's worried he might be gay and using her to hide that. She also mentions their sex life is infrequent and she usually initiates. She's lying about the reason for the breakup, blaming it on her personal issues.\n\nNow, the main question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's think about the key points. Bisexuality is a valid orientation, and coming out is a personal decision. The boyfriend told her truthfully. The author's reaction is based on her own insecurities and assumptions. She's making a judgment about his sexuality based on her own lack of experience and her interpretations of their relationship dynamics. \n\nIs it fair for her to break up because of his bisexuality? If she can't accept that aspect of his identity, then the breakup might be her way of resolving the conflict. However, the problem is that she's lying about the reason for the breakup, which could be dishonest. Also, she's implying that his bisexuality is a cover for him being gay, which could be a harmful assumption. \n\nBut from her perspective, she's honest about her feelings now. Even if she lied initially, her decision is based on personal compatibility. The question is whether she's wrong to prioritize her own comfort. In relationships, both partners need to feel comfortable with each other's choices. If she can't accept his bisexuality, maybe the breakup is justified for her. However, the fact that she's making assumptions about his sexuality and not trusting him without evidence could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the sex frequency and her initiating might not be related to his bisexuality. She's conflating her personal issues with his identity. The key point is whether his bisexuality was a deal-breaker for her. If it was, then she's not wrong in ending the relationship. But if she's using it as an excuse for other issues, that's different. However, the story suggests her main issue is his sexuality. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether it's acceptable to break up due to a partner's bisexuality when it's not affecting the relationship. If she can't accept that part of his identity, then she's not in the wrong. But if she's making unfounded assumptions (like him using her to cover being gay), that's where she might be wrong. However, people have the right to their own boundaries. If being in a relationship with a bisexual person isn't something she can handle, the breakup is her choice. \n\nBut the fact that she's lying about the reason might add guilt because she's not being honest with him. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong overall. So, maybe the answer is that she's not in the wrong because she's making a difficult decision based on her own values and comfort, even if the reasoning isn't perfect. Or maybe she is in the wrong for not being able to accept his identity. It's a bit of a tough call. \n\nI think the key here is that bisexuality is valid and not a phase or cover-up. If she can't accept that, then she's not wrong for ending the relationship, but her assumptions might be problematic. However, people have different deal-breakers, and this is a personal choice. So, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong (B) because she's acting on her own boundaries, even if it's painful.\n"
