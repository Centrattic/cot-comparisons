Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who broke up with her boyfriend for being bisexual is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe girl dated her boyfriend for two years. He told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. She says she doesn't care about his sexuality, but she's never dated a guy who wasn't straight. She was taken aback. They don't have sex often, and she usually initiates. She started wondering if he's gay and using her to cover that. Eventually, she broke up with him but lied about the reason. She admits that if he hadn't come out as bi, they'd still be together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The boyfriend came out to her about his bisexuality. That's a personal matter and might affect the relationship depending on the partner's views. The girl claims she's accepting, but the breakup seems to be based on her discomfort with his sexuality and possible feelings of insecurity about the relationship's intimacy. \n\nBisexuality means being attracted to both men and women. The fact that he had past encounters with men might have made her question his attraction to her. However, bisexuality doesn't mean he's not attracted to her. The problem here might be her own insecurities or lack of understanding about bisexuality. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, breaking up because of someone's sexuality, even if it's a personal choice, can be seen as unfair unless there were other issues. The key point is whether the breakup was justified. If she couldn't accept his bisexuality despite saying she doesn't care about it, that's a contradiction. She might have had valid reasons, like feeling he wasn't attracted to her, but the main trigger was his sexuality. \n\nAlso, lying about the reason for the breakup could be seen as dishonest. She took the high road by saying it's her personal issues, but in reality, it was his sexuality. This might indicate she was avoiding confronting her true feelings, which could be a sign of not being entirely in the wrong, but maybe mishandling the situation. \n\nHowever, in terms of right and wrong, if she's breaking up because he's bisexual and she's okay with it, that's a contradiction. But people can have valid reasons for breaking up based on personal incompatibility, even if it's not about the other person's flaws. So maybe she's not in the wrong because she's choosing what she can and cannot be in a relationship with. But some might argue that she should work through her feelings instead of breaking up over something she claims to accept. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether bisexuality is a deal-breaker for her. Since she admitted she doesn't care about his orientation but acted as if it did, there's hypocrisy. But if she felt he wasn't attracted to her, maybe that's a different issue. However, the main reason stated is his sexuality. So, she might be in the wrong because she broke up over his identity, which he disclosed honestly.\n"
