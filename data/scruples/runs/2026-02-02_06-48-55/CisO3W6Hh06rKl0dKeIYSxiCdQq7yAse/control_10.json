Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup after the boyfriend comes out as bisexual. The author breaks up with him because they can't get past his bisexuality, even though they claim they don't care about someone's sexuality. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author is okay with different sexual orientations in general but hasn't dated non-straight people before. The breakup was because she started doubting his attraction to her, leading her to break up. She admitted lying about the reason.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The main ethical consideration here is about honesty and personal boundaries. If someone is in a relationship and later discovers their partner's sexuality isn't what they expected, does that make them wrong to break up? Well, the author was upfront that she hadn't dated non-straight people before, so maybe this was a dealbreaker for her. However, the boyfriend didn't hide his bisexuality; he came out to her. So if the author couldn't accept that, even though she said she would, then maybe she's being hypocritical. Also, the breakup was based on her insecurities about his attraction, not any betrayal or cheating. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions were honest, but the author's reaction is based on her inability to accept bisexuality. The question is whether she's wrong for ending the relationship because of that. In relationships, people have different dealbreakers. If the author can't accept her partner's sexuality, even if he's honest, then it's valid for her to leave. However, she might be in the wrong if she's being bigoted or if she's not being true to her stated values. \n\nThe original post says she doesn't care about someone's orientation but hadn't dated non-straight people. So maybe she realized she does have an issue with it. But it's also possible that she's being honest with herself and her feelings. The problem is that she broke up with him for a reason she didn't admit, which could be dishonest. However, the main question is about being in the wrong. \n\nIn AITA situations, the community often looks at whether the person acted in bad faith or with prejudice. If the author is genuinely conflicted and her dealbreaker is valid, even if it's about sexuality, she's not in the wrong. But if she's being discriminatory, then she is. However, the author's stated acceptance of others' orientations complicates that. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the decision to end the relationship is a personal one, and she's being honest with her feelings, even if she didn't articulate it fully. The boyfriend was honest, and the author had the right to leave if his sexuality made her uncomfortable beyond what she could accept.\n"
