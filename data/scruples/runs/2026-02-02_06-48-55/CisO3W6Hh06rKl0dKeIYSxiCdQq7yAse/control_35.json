Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is that she broke up with her boyfriend after he told her he's bisexual and had previously hooked up with guys. She claims she's okay with people being gay or bi, but she's never dated a guy who wasn't straight. After his confession, she started doubting his attraction to her and ended the relationship, but she lied about the reason for the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The boyfriend was honest about his bisexuality and past hookups. The author felt uncomfortable after learning this, leading to her breaking up. She mentions that her main issues were about his potential lack of attraction (since he's bi) and maybe using her to \"cover up\" being gay. But she also says she's okay with people's sexuality in general. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. In relationships, communication and mutual compatibility are important. The boyfriend was upfront about his sexuality before they were together. If the author wasn't comfortable with dating a bisexual man, maybe she should have addressed that earlier. However, the boyfriend didn't hide his sexuality; he came out to her. She couldn't handle it, leading to the breakup. \n\nIs it wrong for her to end the relationship because of his sexuality? In many contexts, it's considered okay for someone to end a relationship if their values or comfort levels don't align. But if the issue is solely about his bisexuality and not any actual harmful behavior, some might argue that it's a problem with his identity rather than his actions. However, she did try to process it and realized she wasn't comfortable, which is a valid reason for some people.\n\nShe lied about the breakup reason, which could be seen as insincere. But the core issue is whether her reason for breaking up was justified. Since she admitted she couldn't get past his bisexuality despite claiming to accept others, that might make her the asshole. On the other hand, if she felt it wasn't a good fit for her, even if it's not the partner's fault, it's her choice.\n\nAlso, considering that bisexuality doesn't inherently mean he's not attracted to her. The author's paranoia about his attraction might be her own insecurities, not his fault. So, if she's breaking up because of something he disclosed honestly, even if it's a personal choice, she might be in the wrong for not accepting his identity. But if she's not ready for a relationship with a bisexual partner, it's her right to end it. However, the fact that she felt the need to lie about her reasons complicates things.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, people are considered the asshole if they act without considering the other person's feelings or if their reasoning is based on prejudice. If her issue is solely his bisexuality without any other issues, that could be seen as discriminatory. But she did mention she accepted that people should find happiness, which might indicate that she's conflicted. So, the answer might hinge on whether her reaction is based on prejudice versus personal incompatibility.\n"
