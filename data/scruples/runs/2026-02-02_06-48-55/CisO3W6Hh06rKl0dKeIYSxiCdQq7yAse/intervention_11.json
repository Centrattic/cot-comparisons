Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author, a woman in a two-year relationship with a man, breaks up with him after he comes out as bisexual. She mentions she doesn't have an issue with his sexuality in general but admits she's never dated a non-straight guy before. She was taken aback by his confession. Later, she starts doubting whether he's even attracted to her, leading to the breakup. She admits the real reason is his bisexuality, but tells him it's personal issues instead.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of being in the wrong. In relationships, it's often about mutual respect, communication, and what each person can accept. If someone can't accept a partner's sexual orientation, that's a personal issue, but it's also a valid reason to end a relationship if it's causing conflict.\n\nThe author says she doesn't care if someone is gay or bi in general, but in this case, she couldn't get past it. That suggests that her personal discomfort or lack of experience with non-straight partners led her to end the relationship. She also mentions that the frequency of their sex and her initiating it made her question his attraction, but she admits she's not bothered by the frequency. However, her paranoia about whether he's attracted to her is influenced by his bisexuality.\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, which is a valid reason for the author to reconsider the relationship. If she realized that her core issue is his bisexuality and she can't move past it, then ending the relationship based on that honesty might be her choice. On the other hand, if she was using his bisexuality as a cover for other issues or if she was dishonest about her reasons, that could be problematic.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The boyfriend was upfront about his bisexuality. 2) The author admitted she had never dated a non-straight person before and was taken aback. 3) Her decision to end the relationship was based on his bisexuality, even though she lied about the reason.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the boyfriend was truthful and the author decided to end the relationship because she couldn't accept his sexuality, then it's her choice. However, if the author is projecting her insecurities or if there were other unresolved issues in the relationship, that's a different matter. But according to her own admission, she's lying about the reason and attributing the breakup to other personal issues. That could be seen as dishonest, especially if she's not being truthful with her ex.\n\nBut is that being in the wrong? Or is it just a personal decision based on her own needs and incompatibilities? Relationships are about mutual compatibility. If she realized that his bisexuality is a deal-breaker for her, even though she initially thought she was okay with it, then ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. However, the dishonesty about the reason might be a separate issue.\n\nSome might argue that if she couldn't accept his bisexuality, then it's her choice, but lying about the reason could be seen as avoiding responsibility. Others might say that if the relationship was no longer working because of fundamental differences, then it's fair to end it, even if you're not entirely honest about the reason.\n\nIn the context of AITA (Am I the Asshole) type questions, the community often looks at whether the action was justified and if the person is in the wrong for their behavior. Here, the author is admitting fault in lying but is unsure if she's in the wrong for ending the relationship. The key is whether ending the relationship because of his bisexuality is fair. If the boyfriend didn't violate any agreements (like being in a monogamous relationship), then the author's decision is more about personal incompatibility rather than a betrayal.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for ending the relationship because it's her choice based on personal incompatibility. However, the dishonesty about the reason could be a point against her. But in AITA contexts, the main question is about the action (breaking up) rather than the honesty about the reason. So if the core action (breaking up due to his bisexuality) is considered acceptable, then she's not in the wrong. If it's considered unreasonable, then she is. Since bisexuality is a valid sexual orientation and the boyfriend was honest, the author's decision might be seen as her choice, hence not the wrong.\n"
