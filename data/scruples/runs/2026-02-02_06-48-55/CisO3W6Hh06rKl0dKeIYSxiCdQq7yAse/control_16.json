Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe boyfriend came out as bisexual and admitted to hooking up with guys before. The author of the post doesn't have an issue with his sexuality but felt uncomfortable and ended the relationship, even though they were in a two-year relationship. She mentions that the breakup was actually because of his bisexuality but lied about the reason. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if being bisexual is a valid reason to break up. Bisexuality itself isn't a deal-breaker for everyone, but for some, it might be. The key here is that the author felt she couldn't get past his sexuality despite saying she doesn't care. Also, she mentions that the relationship had other issues: infrequent sex, usually initiated by her, and lack of lust. However, she admits that if he hadn't come out, they'd still be together, implying that his bisexuality was the main reason for the breakup.\n\nNext, I should think about consent and honesty. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality when he felt ready, which is important for trust. The author had the choice to accept that or not. If she couldn't accept his bisexuality, then leaving isn't necessarily wrong because you can't force a relationship. But some might argue that she should have addressed her feelings earlier instead of ending it after two years.\n\nAnother angle is societal norms and personal values. If she's not in a monogamous relationship, his bisexuality might not matter. But if she's in a monogamous one, maybe she felt threatened. However, bisexuality doesn't mean he's going to be unfaithful. The author's reasoning might stem from insecurity or personal preferences.\n\nAlso, the fact that she lied about the breakup reason could indicate guilt or fear of judgment. That's a red flag for some, but others might see it as a way to protect feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, whether she's in the wrong depends on perspective. If the issue was his bisexuality and not trust or infidelity, then it's her right to leave. However, if the problem was more about insecurity or personal bias against bisexuality, then she might be in the wrong. Since the post shows she's reflecting on her actions and the main issue was his sexuality, it's a personal choice. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because people have the right to their boundaries in relationships.\n"
