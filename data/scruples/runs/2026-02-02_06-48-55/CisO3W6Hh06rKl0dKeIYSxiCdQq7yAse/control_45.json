Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. He told her he had hooked up with guys before, which made her question his attraction to her and led to her breaking things off. She mentions that she doesn't care about his sexuality but felt unsettled because he wasn't straight. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend came out to her, and she felt she couldn't move past that. She admits that if he hadn't told her, they'd still be together. That seems to indicate that his disclosure was the reason she ended it. She's in denial about that, blaming personal issues instead.\n\nNow, in terms of right or wrong. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If the boyfriend was honest about his sexuality, and he hadn't been hiding it during the relationship, then he did the right thing by being open. The author's issue is with his sexuality, which isn't his fault. However, if the author felt uncomfortable about that aspect, maybe she should have addressed it earlier. Breaking up after he came out, especially when she acknowledges that she's not against bisexuality in general, could be seen as unfair. Her decision to lie about the reason for the breakup might also be a point against her.\n\nBut, it's important to remember that people have different boundaries. If being with someone who is bisexual makes her uncomfortable, even if she claims not to have a problem with it, then it's her right to end the relationship. However, in this case, she seems to be projecting some insecurities or misunderstandings about bisexuality. Bisexuality means attraction to more than one gender, but it doesn't mean he's not attracted to her. Her paranoia about his attraction might stem from her own issues rather than any actual problem with him.\n\nAlso, the fact that the relationship had other issues like infrequent sex and her initiating it could be contributing factors, but she's attributing the breakup solely to his sexuality. She admits she's never dated a non-straight person before, so maybe she wasn't ready for that. But that's her choice. However, since he didn't hide his sexuality and came out to her, it's not his fault she couldn't handle it. \n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong for breaking up with him because of his sexuality. Since she claims she doesn't care about his orientation, but her actions say otherwise, she might be acting on internalized biases or a lack of understanding. But in a relationship, both people need to be comfortable. If she can't accept his sexuality, even if he's honest about it, then maybe she is at fault for not being honest about her own feelings earlier. However, if she's breaking up because of her own insecurities, she's not necessarily in the wrong, but she's being dishonest about the real reason. The key is whether he was being truthful and she's ending it out of her own inability to accept his sexuality despite saying she's okay with it.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether she had the right to end the relationship because of something she later admits isn't her issue. Since she couldn't accept his bisexuality even though she says she's okay with others being bi, that's a contradiction. Therefore, she's in the wrong because she broke up with him for reasons she doesn't truly believe are valid, and she's hiding the real reason from him.\n"
