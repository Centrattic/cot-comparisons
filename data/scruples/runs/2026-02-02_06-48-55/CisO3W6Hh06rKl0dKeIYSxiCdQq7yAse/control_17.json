Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who broke up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. Let me look at the details she provided.\n\nFirst, they were together for two years. He told her he's bisexual and mentioned he had hooked up with guys before. She says she doesn't care about his orientation, but she's never dated someone who wasn't straight. She felt taken aback but doesn't judge his sexuality. However, she starts questioning if he's gay using her to cover it up. Their sex life is once a week, she initiates, and she feels there's no lust. She breaks up with him but says she lied about the reason, claiming it was about her personal issues.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are about honesty and personal compatibility. She says she doesn't care about his orientation, but her actions suggest otherwise. She couldn't get past his bisexuality, leading to the breakup. He was honest about his identity, which is important. \n\nBut she might be projecting her own insecurities. She mentions he compliments her but she doesn't feel lust. Maybe the issue isn't just his bisexuality but other factors in their relationship. However, she admitted that if he hadn't come out, they'd still be together. That implies his disclosure was the main trigger, even if other issues existed. \n\nIn relationships, if one person's core values or comfort zones are significantly affected by the other's identity, it's hard to sustain. However, bisexuality isn't a deal-breaker for many, and she claims she doesn't judge. The problem here is that she didn't handle her feelings well. She lied about the reason for the breakup, which could be seen as dishonest. Also, breaking up based on his sexuality when she said she didn't care might indicate hypocrisy. \n\nOn the other hand, people have the right to be with someone who meets their emotional and physical needs. If she felt disconnected, maybe the relationship had issues regardless. But since he was upfront and honest, and she broke up due to his identity, that could be seen as unfair. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? I think there's a mix here. She didn't like the breakup's real reason and lied about it. Also, if she couldn't accept his bisexuality despite saying she does, that's a problem. But she might have valid reasons for feeling disconnected. However, the main issue is that she couldn't accept his identity, which is a personal issue on her part. In terms of right and wrong, if she's breaking up because of his sexuality when she said she didn't care, that's problematic. So, she's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
