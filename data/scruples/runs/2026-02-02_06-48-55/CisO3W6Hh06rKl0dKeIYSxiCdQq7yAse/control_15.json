Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he came out as bisexual is in the wrong. The key points here are about the dynamics of their relationship and the reasons for the breakup.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend came out as bisexual and admitted to hooking up with guys before. The author clarifies they don't care about his sexuality, but they're uncomfortable because they've only dated straight guys before. The relationship wasn't very physically intimate, with sex happening once a week and the author initiating it. The author then breaks up, but lies about the reason, blaming personal issues instead of the boyfriend's bisexuality.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, bisexuality is about being attracted to more than one gender. The boyfriend didn't say he's only interested in men now. The author's discomfort seems to stem from the fact that he's bisexual and had past relationships with men, which might make them question his attraction to them. The problem here is that the author allowed his past to affect their current relationship. In a healthy relationship, past experiences shouldn't necessarily dictate the present unless they're ongoing issues. The boyfriend's actions (hooking up with guys before them) are in the past, and if he's monogamous now, that shouldn't be a dealbreaker. The author's breakup based on his sexuality, even if they claim not to care, might be a form of internalized stigma or insecurity. Also, lying about the reason for the breakup could be seen as dishonest, which might hurt the ex more. \n\nBut then, relationships are about mutual compatibility. If the author felt uncomfortable and couldn't move past it, breaking up might be their right. However, the main issue is that the breakup is based on something the author didn't initially think would matter (his sexuality) but later became a problem. That could be seen as a personal issue rather than the boyfriend being wrong. So, the author's actions are understandable in terms of their own feelings but ethically, they might be at fault for not addressing their insecurities and instead letting them lead to a breakup without full honesty.\n"
