Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (TA) is in the wrong for breaking up with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The couple was together for two years. The boyfriend, who is 26, told his 24-year-old girlfriend that he's bisexual and admitted to having hooked up with guys before. The TA clarifies she's not against bisexuality itself but is unsettled because she hasn't dated a non-straight guy before. She then starts questioning their relationship dynamics\u2014infrequent sex, her usually initiating, and feeling no lust. She ends up breaking up, but attributes it to personal issues rather than his sexuality. The boyfriend says it's because of his bisexuality, but she denies that. The TA is now wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the TA is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. Let's consider the ethical and relational aspects. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend disclosed his bisexuality. That's a personal matter and a significant step, especially if it's something he felt comfortable sharing after some time in the relationship. The TA's reaction is based on her discomfort with his sexuality, even though she claims she doesn't care about others' orientations. But her discomfort led her to end the relationship, even going as far as lying about the real reason. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should be comfortable with each other's identities. If one's sexual orientation is a deal-breaker for the other, that's a red flag. However, the TA is using her lack of experience with non-straight partners as a reason. That might indicate a personal insecurity or bias rather than an issue with the boyfriend's actions. \n\nThe boyfriend's action was honest and possibly in line with being transparent. The TA's decision to end the relationship because of his sexuality, even if she rationalizes it with other factors (like sex frequency), seems to be rooted in her personal discomfort. She even admits that if he hadn't disclosed, they'd still be together. That suggests her decision was based on his bisexuality, not the other issues she mentioned. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider that people have the right to leave relationships for any reason, as long as they're honest about it. But the TA lied about the reason, which complicates things. Lying about the cause of a breakup can be seen as manipulative or not respecting the other person's feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the TA might feel that she's not in a fulfilling relationship regardless of his sexuality. The sex frequency and her initiating could be signs of underlying issues. But the fact that she attributes the breakup to his sexuality while lying about it might mean she's not taking full responsibility for her own insecurities or the real issues in the relationship. \n\nIn terms of ethics, being in the wrong could be about being dishonest or making a decision based on prejudice. Since she admitted she didn't care about being with a bi person but still ended it because of that, it's possible she's projecting her own biases. The boyfriend was honest, and her reaction was based on her own feelings rather than any wrongdoing on his part. \n\nSo, the TA's actions might be seen as wrong because she ended the relationship due to his sexuality, which is a personal choice and not a valid reason for a breakup, and she lied about the reason, which is disrespectful. However, in relationships, personal compatibility is key, and if someone can't get past a partner's orientation, it's a personal choice to leave. But the dishonesty here is a factor. \n\nThe question is whether the TA is in the wrong. If we're considering moral responsibility, making a decision based on prejudice (even if unintentional) and dishonesty would lean towards her being in the wrong. However, if it's about personal choice and right to leave a relationship, maybe not. But since the main reason she gave up was his sexuality, which he had already disclosed, and she lied about it, that's a significant ethical issue.\n"
