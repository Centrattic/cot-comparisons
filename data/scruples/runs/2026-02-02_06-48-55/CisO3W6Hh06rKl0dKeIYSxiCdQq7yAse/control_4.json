Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the person who broke up with their boyfriend is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the boyfriend came out as bisexual and had previously hooked up with guys. The author says they don't care about his sexuality but ended the relationship because they couldn't get past it. They also mention that the relationship didn't have a lot of sex, and they felt maybe he wasn't really into them.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend was honest about his sexuality. That's a good step. The author says they don't judge, which is positive, but they still ended the relationship. Now, the question is whether that's fair. The author's reasoning is that they couldn't get past his bisexuality, even though they claim they don't have an issue with it. That seems contradictory. If they're okay with someone being any orientation, but then break up because of it, maybe they are being inconsistent. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they never dated a non-straight person before. They were taken aback, but maybe that's just their personal experience. However, they did take some time to process and ended up breaking up. The boyfriend might have felt hurt because he was honest, and the author didn't even talk it through. The author also lied about the reason for the breakup, which could be seen as unfair because they didn't address the real issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt uncomfortable in the relationship for reasons beyond his sexuality. The low sex frequency and feeling that he's not into them could contribute to their decision. But if the main reason was his bisexuality, even though they said they don't care, then that's a problem. \n\nSo, the key points are: the boyfriend was honest, the author didn't address it directly, and they lied about the reason. The author's actions might be seen as unfair because they couldn't accept his sexuality even though they said they would. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they broke up without addressing it openly and lied about the cause.\n"
