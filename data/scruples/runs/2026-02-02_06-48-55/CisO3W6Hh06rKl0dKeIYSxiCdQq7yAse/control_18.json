Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a woman in a two-year relationship with a boyfriend who turns out to be bisexual. He confesses he's had relationships with men before, which shocks her. She breaks up with him, but she later admits that it was actually his bisexuality that led her to end things, even though she told him it was due to her personal issues. Now she's asking if she's the a**hole.\n\nFirst, let me recall the key points. The boyfriend was honest about his bisexuality and past hookups with men. The author says she doesn't care about someone's sexual orientation in general but is okay with straight people. She was taken aback because she's only dated straight guys before. The relationship wasn't very sexual, with infrequent sex initiated by her. She started doubting if he was even attracted to her, leading her to break up. However, she lied about the reason for the breakup. Now she's wondering if she's at fault.\n\nHmm. The question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break down the ethical aspects. The boyfriend was honest and shared his sexuality as a big reveal. That's something a person has a right to know about their partner. The author's reaction was based on her personal boundaries. But she had two years to figure this out. If she was uncomfortable with his bisexuality, was it fair to wait until now? Also, she lied about the breakup reason, which might add to the issue.\n\nBut wait, the user mentions that they don't have sex often, and when they do, the author initiates. She's questioning if he's even attracted to her, which is separate from his bisexuality. However, she admits she couldn't get past his bisexuality even if he was truthful. So her decision to break up was based on his sexuality, but she lied about it. \n\nIn relationships, compatibility includes accepting each other's identities. If someone's identity (like being bisexual) isn't compatible with the other person's needs, that's a valid reason to break up. However, the timing and the lie might affect that. Did he disclose something that was a deal-breaker for her, and she decided it was a problem? If she had her own boundaries and couldn't accept that, then it's not necessarily her fault. But if she knew about his past and was okay with it until now, maybe she should have addressed it earlier.\n\nAlso, considering that he was honest, he might have been open about his sexuality from the start. If she found out now, maybe she didn't know before, but he didn't hide it. So she's choosing to end the relationship because she's uncomfortable with his sexuality, even though she claims to accept others. That might be seen as inconsistent. However, people can have personal limits, and it's hard to judge that. \n\nThe fact that she lied about the breakup reason complicates things. If he needed closure, lying about the real reason could be hurtful. But if she couldn't express it, maybe she felt protecting her own feelings was necessary. \n\nIn summary, the ethical dilemma is whether her decision to break up over his bisexuality makes her at fault. If she had legitimate reasons and communicated them honestly, maybe not. But she lied, which could be a problem. However, if her feelings were genuine and she couldn't accept his identity, it's a personal choice. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. Alternatively, if the answer is A, she's wrong for not addressing it earlier and lying. But the community might see it as her right to end the relationship.\n"
