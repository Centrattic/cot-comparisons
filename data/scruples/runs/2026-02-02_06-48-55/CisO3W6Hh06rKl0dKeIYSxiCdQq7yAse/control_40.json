Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, a woman, ended her two-year relationship with her boyfriend after he came out as bisexual. He told her he had hooked up with guys before, which made her uncomfortable. She doesn't have an issue with his sexuality per se, but she starts doubting if he's really attracted to her. She then breaks up with him, but lies about the reason, blaming her own personal issues instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend came out as bisexual. The author is okay with people being gay or bi, but she's never dated a non-straight guy before. She feels taken aback, but the main issue seems to be her uncertainty about his attraction to her and his lack of interest in sex. She breaks up with him but denies it's because of his sexuality, lying instead.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, people have the right to their own feelings in relationships. If she's uncomfortable with his sexuality and it's leading her to doubt the relationship, she's not necessarily wrong for ending it. However, the fact that she lied about the reason might complicate things. She admits her own discomfort, which is valid, but the lie could be seen as dishonest.\n\nBut the main ethical consideration here is whether her decision was based on prejudice. She says she's okay with people being bi, but her discomfort stems from not having dated a non-straight guy before and the lack of physical intimacy. It's possible she has internalized biases even if she doesn't openly hold them. However, relationships are about mutual compatibility. If she can't accept his identity or feels insecure because of it, she might be right to end things for her own well-being.\n\nThe boyfriend didn't do anything deceptive; he came out to her honestly. The author's reaction is based on her own feelings and insecurities. While lying about the breakup reason is a negative point, the decision to break up might be justified if she can't move past her discomfort. So, in terms of being in the wrong, maybe not. She's acting on her own needs, even if imperfectly. The key is whether the breakup was due to his identity or her personal issues. She claims it's the former but blames the latter. The lie complicates it, but the core issue is her incompatibility with his bisexuality, which is a personal choice. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
