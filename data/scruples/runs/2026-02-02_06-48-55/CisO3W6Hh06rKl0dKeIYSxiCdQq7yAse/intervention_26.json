Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their boyfriend after he confessed to being bisexual is in the wrong. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author (26M) dated a 24-year-old girl for two years. He told her he's bisexual and admitted to hooking up with guys before. She claims she doesn't care about his sexuality, but she's never dated someone not straight. She broke up with him, lying about the reason. She mentions that the relationship had low sexual frequency and she often initiated, which made her question if he was really attracted to her. She admits the real reason was his bisexuality, even though she tried to blame personal issues.\n\nNow, considering the situation: Bisexuality is about attraction to both genders. The boyfriend was honest about his sexuality. The author states she doesn't care about his orientation but couldn't get past it. She broke up for personal reasons but lied. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nIn relationships, compatibility is key. If someone can't accept a partner's sexuality, even if they say they don't care, it might be a deal-breaker. However, the boyfriend was honest upfront. The author's issue isn't with his sexuality per se but with the possibility he's using her to hide being gay. But she admits she's never dated someone not straight, so maybe she wasn't prepared for that situation.\n\nThe key point is whether it's fair to break up for this reason. If someone's core values or needs aren't met, breaking up isn't wrong. However, lying about the reason might complicate things. But the main issue is if the author's decision was justified. Since she couldn't accept his sexuality despite saying she would, she might be in the wrong for not being honest with herself and him from the start. But if her feelings were genuine, maybe she isn't. But the fact that she lied about the breakup reason suggests she knew it was a sensitive issue and chose to avoid confrontation, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn many AITA cases, being honest about your deal-breakers is important. If she realized she couldn't accept his bisexuality after two years, maybe she's in the wrong for not addressing that earlier. Alternatively, if his bisexuality was a deal-breaker she hadn't considered before, she's not wrong for having that realization, even if it's later.\n\nBut the boyfriend was open about it, so she should have addressed her feelings sooner. Lying about the reason might add to the problem. So overall, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because she broke up for a reason she didn't disclose, which could be seen as dishonest. However, if her feelings were genuine, it's a bit tricky. But the consensus in AITA often is that if someone can't accept a partner's identity, even if stated upfront, they might be the asshole. So probably A.\n"
