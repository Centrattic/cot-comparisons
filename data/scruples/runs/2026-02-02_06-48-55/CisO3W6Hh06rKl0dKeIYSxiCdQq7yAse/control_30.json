Overall, he\u2019s a great person and I hope that we can stay friends, despite what happened. \n\nBasically, a few weeks ago, we were having drinks at his apartment. He said there was something he wanted to tell me and he hoped I wouldn\u2019t judge. I said okay (obviously nervous). He told me that he thinks he\u2019s bi. I asked what makes him think that and he finally admitted that he had hooked up with a few guys before me. \n\nNow, I just want to clarify that I don\u2019t care if a person is gay, bi, whatever. You only get one life and you should try to find happiness. But I have never (as far as I know) dated a guy who wasn\u2019t straight. So I was a little taken aback. \n\nThe rest of the night was somewhat awkward and we ended up just going to sleep. Over the next several days I started thinking of our relationship. We don\u2019t have sex that often for a young couple. Maybe once a week (always been that way). And when we do have sex I usually initiate. I\u2019m not bothered by the frequency  but I started questioning whether my boyfriend might just be gay and using me to cover that up. I started getting paranoid over whether he\u2019s even attracted to me (he compliments me on my appearance but I\u2019ve never felt...lust). \n\nAnyway I ended up breaking up with him. He said it was because he\u2019s bi and I denied that was the reason. I blamed the break up on some personal stuff I\u2019m going through and said I needed time alone. \n\nBut that was actually a lie. If he hadn\u2019t disclosed that stuff about his sexuality, I have no doubt we\u2019d still be together. I just couldn\u2019t get past it for some reason. \n\nAITA in this situation?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their boyfriend because he's bisexual is in the wrong. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend told her he's bisexual and had hooked up with guys before. The author says she doesn't care about his sexuality but was taken aback because she's only dated straight guys. She ended the relationship, but she later admitted that if he hadn't come out as bi, they'd still be together. She lied about the reason for the breakup, blaming herself instead.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether being in a relationship with someone who's bi is a valid reason to break up. The author isn't against his sexuality itself but felt something was off, leading her to question if he's even attracted to her. She felt he might be using her to cover being gay.\n\nBut wait, being bisexual means someone is attracted to both genders. So if he's bi, he can be attracted to women and men. The fact that he's had past hookups with men doesn't mean he's not attracted to her. The author's issue seems to stem from her own feelings of insecurity or not feeling enough connection. She mentions that she usually initiates sex and they don't have it often. Maybe her insecurities led her to doubt his attraction because of his sexuality.\n\nAlso, she broke up with him after he came out, then lied about the reason. She later admitted that his sexuality was the real issue. The key here is whether she had a right to end the relationship based on his sexuality when she stated she doesn't care about it. But maybe she had valid reasons if she felt there was a lack of connection, but the problem is that she's using his sexuality as a justification for her own insecurities.\n\nIn relationships, if one person's identity isn't accepted, that's a problem. However, the author claims she's okay with his sexuality but still felt the need to break up. Since bisexuality is a valid orientation, she's not in the wrong if she felt it's incompatible, but there's a nuance here. She might have been projecting her own issues onto him instead of addressing her own insecurities. If she couldn't accept his sexuality despite her initial statement, that could be an issue. Alternatively, if she felt it's a dealbreaker for her, she's within her right to end it. However, the fact that she lied about the reason might complicate things, but the core question is whether she's in the wrong for the breakup itself.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (No) because she's not in the wrong for ending a relationship if she felt it wasn't working for her, even if it's based on his sexuality. But some might argue that bisexuality shouldn't be a dealbreaker if she said she doesn't care. However, the situation is more about her personal feelings and compatibility rather than outright rejection of his identity. Since she's allowed herself to feel that way, it's her choice, so she's not in the wrong.\n"
