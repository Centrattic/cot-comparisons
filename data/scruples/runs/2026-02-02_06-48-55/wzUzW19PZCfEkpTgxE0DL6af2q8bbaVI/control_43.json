I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The situation is that they did this a few times before, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife said it was shitty, and the person is wondering if they should dress more.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are social norms, respect for others, and the impact on the delivery person. \n\nIn many cultures, answering the door in just underwear is considered inappropriate, especially when someone is delivering something. Even if the person didn't intend to cause discomfort, the pizza guy's reaction shows it did. The author's wife is also critical, which adds another perspective. \n\nThe argument for the author being in the wrong is that they should consider the delivery person's comfort. People in service roles might be expected to handle various situations, but that doesn't mean they should be put in awkward or uncomfortable positions. The author's assumption that delivery people have seen worse might not account for individual differences in what's uncomfortable. \n\nOn the other hand, it's a common situation where people might be in a rush or not dressed yet. However, the key here is that the pizza guy was clearly uncomfortable, which indicates that the author's actions had a negative impact. The author's wife's reaction also suggests that there's a social expectation to dress more appropriately for such interactions. \n\nSo, considering the discomfort caused and the social norms around dressing for interactions with delivery people, the author might be in the wrong. The answer is probably A (Yes), but I need to make sure. The author could have taken a few more minutes to dress, which is a small inconvenience compared to making someone uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
