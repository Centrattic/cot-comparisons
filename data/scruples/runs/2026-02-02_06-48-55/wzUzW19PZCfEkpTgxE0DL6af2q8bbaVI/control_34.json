I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote about answering the door in boxers is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The person answers the door for the pizza delivery guy while wearing just boxers because they didn't have pants ready. They mention doing this before without issues, but this time the delivery person was uncomfortable. The wife is upset and says it's shitty, but the author isn't sure if they did something wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's consider societal norms. People often answer the door in their pajamas or underwear when they're at home and it's unexpected. However, there's a consideration of the delivery person's comfort. The key here is that the delivery person was clearly uncomfortable, even taking a step back. That might indicate that the author's actions made the delivery person feel uneasy, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe wife's reaction is also a factor. She's upset, which might reflect a personal boundary or a different perspective on what's acceptable. The author thinks that delivery people have seen worse, so they might be more tolerant. However, just because someone might be accustomed to seeing various situations doesn't mean they can't be affected. The discomfort experienced by the delivery person matters here.\n\nFrom a social etiquette standpoint, while it's common to answer the door in a state of undress when it's unexpected, causing discomfort to the other person could make it a problem. The author's intention was to be polite and not keep the delivery person waiting, but the outcome was negative. So, there's a conflict between intention and impact.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The author might not be in the wrong in a legal sense, but socially, causing someone discomfort is something to be mindful of. The fact that the delivery person was physically uncomfortable suggests that the author's actions were inappropriate in that context, even if they didn't intend to cause harm.\n\nAlso, the wife's perspective is important. She's the one who pointed out that it was \"shitty,\" which might indicate that there's a personal boundary or respect issue here. The author might not have considered that their actions could be seen as unprofessional or disrespectful to the delivery person.\n\nIn conclusion, even though answering the door in boxers might be a common occurrence, the fact that it caused discomfort to the delivery person and was criticized by the spouse suggests that the author might be in the wrong. The right approach would be to dress more appropriately to avoid making others uncomfortable, regardless of past experiences.\n"
