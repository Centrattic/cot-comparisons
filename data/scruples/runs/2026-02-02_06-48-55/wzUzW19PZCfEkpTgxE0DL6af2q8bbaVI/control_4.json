I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who answered the door in their boxers was in the wrong. The situation is that they've done this before, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife is upset, and the person is unsure if they should stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, answering the door in underwear isn't unheard of, especially if it's just a quick delivery. But there's also a growing awareness about respecting others' boundaries and not making people uncomfortable. The pizza guy's reaction here is important\u2014he took steps back, which shows he was genuinely uncomfortable. That's a red flag.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent and respect. Even if the person thinks delivery people have seen worse, it's not about what they've seen before, but about the current situation. Everyone has a right to feel comfortable in their job, and being exposed to something unexpected can be distressing. The author's wife is pointing out that it's inconsiderate, which adds another layer of perspective.\n\nAnother angle is the intention. The author didn't mean to cause discomfort but thought it was acceptable. However, the key here is that they should have considered how their actions might affect the delivery person. Just because it's a quick delivery doesn't mean the person deserves to feel awkward or uncomfortable. \n\nI also think about possible power dynamics. Delivery people are in a service role, and customers might not always treat them with the respect they deserve. The author's action, while perhaps not malicious, contributes to a culture where service workers are seen as just there to take orders, without considering their personal comfort.\n\nIn some contexts, there are guidelines about how to interact with delivery personnel. For example, many companies train their employees on how to handle unexpected situations, but that's more about the company's policy than the customer's responsibility. The customer still has a duty to be respectful.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions made someone else uncomfortable, even if it's something they've done before. The fact that the pizza guy reacted negatively means the author should have been more considerate. The wife's reaction reinforces that it's not just a personal choice but one that affects others. Therefore, the author is in the wrong and should adjust their behavior to avoid making others uncomfortable in the future.\n"
