I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who answered the door in their boxers is in the wrong. The situation is that the pizza delivery guy was uncomfortable, and the person's wife criticized them. The author is wondering if they should start dressing more appropriately for deliveries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many cultures, answering the door in underwear is generally considered inappropriate, even if it's common in some places. The delivery person's reaction\u2014stepping back and being uncomfortable\u2014suggests that this might not be the norm for them. The author's wife also called it \"shitty,\" which adds a personal perspective of disapproval.\n\nThen there's the argument that delivery people might have seen worse, so maybe it's not a big deal. However, just because someone might be exposed to various situations doesn't mean they wouldn't feel uncomfortable in certain ones. The key here is respect and consideration for the other person's feelings. The author's intention was to avoid keeping the delivery guy waiting, which is polite, but the manner of answering the door might have been disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the author felt guilty after the fact, indicating they recognized something might be off. The wife's reaction reinforces that there's a social expectation to dress appropriately even for deliveries. While it's not illegal, social etiquette often dictates that one should present themselves in a way that's respectful to others, especially strangers.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author had good intentions, the act of answering the door in boxers caused discomfort to the delivery person and was disapproved by their wife. Social norms suggest that dressing appropriately, even for brief interactions, is the right thing to do. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the other person's comfort.\n"
