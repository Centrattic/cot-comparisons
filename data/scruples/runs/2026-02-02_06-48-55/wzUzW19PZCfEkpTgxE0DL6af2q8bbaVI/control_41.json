I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers. The situation involves the pizza guy reacting uncomfortably and stepping back, leading to the author feeling guilty. The wife is upset, and the author is unsure if they should change their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many places, it's common for people to answer the door in relaxed clothing, especially for deliveries. However, the key here is the delivery person's reaction. The author mentions that the guy was clearly uncomfortable, which is a red flag. Even if the author didn't intend to make the person uncomfortable, the effect is what matters here.\n\nNext, the author's reasoning: they thought delivery people have seen worse and wouldn't mind. But this is an assumption. Just because some might be desensitized doesn't mean it's respectful. Everyone has different boundaries and comfort levels. The fact that the delivery guy reacted shows that it was inappropriate for that situation.\n\nThe wife's reaction supports the idea that the author's action was considered unacceptable by another person close to them. The author's own guilt after the incident also indicates that they recognize there might be an issue, even if they weren't sure at first.\n\nConsidering respect and professionalism, delivery workers are doing their job and should feel safe and respected. Expecting them to handle such situations without issue might overlook their personal space and dignity. The author's action, while perhaps not malicious, does come off as inconsiderate in this specific case where it caused discomfort.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions led to someone else's discomfort, and even if it's a common practice, respecting others' boundaries is important. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
