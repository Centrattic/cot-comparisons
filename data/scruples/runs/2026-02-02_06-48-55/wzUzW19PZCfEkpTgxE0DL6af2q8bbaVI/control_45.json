I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is wrong for answering the door in boxers for a pizza delivery. The person did this before, but this time the delivery guy was uncomfortable. The wife said it was shitty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Answering the door in underwear is generally considered inappropriate, especially for strangers. Even if the person is just delivering pizza, it's a public interaction. The pizza guy's reaction\u2014stepping back and being uncomfortable\u2014shows that it's not just the person's perception.\n\nThe argument that delivery people have seen worse might not hold because it's still a breach of personal boundaries. Just because someone is accustomed to seeing various situations doesn't mean it's acceptable. The person's action could be seen as disrespectful or unprofessional, even if unintended. The wife's reaction supports that there's a problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the person might argue they were trying to be polite by not keeping the delivery waiting. But politeness should also include dressing appropriately for the situation. There's a balance between being courteous and maintaining respect for others' comfort.\n\nSo, the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, were inconsiderate. They should consider dressing more fully for deliveries to avoid making others uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
