I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who answered the door in boxers is in the wrong. So the situation is that the person answered the door for the pizza guy in their boxers. They mentioned they've done it before, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife said it was shitty. The person is wondering if they should start dressing more when answering the door.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. Let me break it down. \n\nThe key points here are: answering the door in underwear, the pizza guy's discomfort, and the wife's reaction. The person's reasoning was that delivery people have seen worse, so it's not a big deal. But this time, the pizza guy reacted badly. \n\nSo, from a general societal standpoint, answering the door in underwear is usually considered inappropriate. Even if delivery people might be used to seeing various things, it's still respectful to be dressed appropriately. The pizza guy's discomfort is a sign that the action was unprofessional or made him uneasy. The wife's criticism adds another layer, indicating that the person's partner thinks it's wrong. \n\nThe person's justification is that they didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting. While that's a considerate thought, the method of answering the door in boxers might not be the best way to show respect. There might be alternatives, like putting on a robe or pants quickly if possible. \n\nConsidering privacy and respect, even if it's a delivery person, there's a standard of decency expected when opening the door. The discomfort of the pizza guy suggests that the action crossed a boundary for him. The person's wife's reaction also shows that their partner values this standard. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's a minor issue and that delivery people are accustomed to various situations. However, the key here is the impact on the delivery person. Since this time it caused discomfort, it's worth reconsidering the behavior. \n\nSo, balancing the intent (not to be rude) with the outcome (making someone uncomfortable), the person might be in the wrong. They should consider dressing appropriately even if it's just for a quick answer. The wife's point about it being \"shitty\" could be valid because it's about respecting others' comfort levels. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong. They should take the time to dress more appropriately to avoid making others uncomfortable, even if they think the delivery person might be used to it.\n"
