I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person answered the door in their boxers for a pizza delivery. They mention they've done it before, and others didn't react much. This time, the delivery person was uncomfortable and stepped back. The wife called it \"shitty,\" and now the person is questioning if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many places, answering the door in underwear is seen as inappropriate, even if it's common. The key here is the delivery person's reaction. They were clearly uncomfortable, which suggests the action was off-putting. The person's wife also disapproves, which adds another layer of social judgment.\n\nThe argument might be that delivery people are used to seeing various things, so maybe it's not a big deal. But the fact that the person felt guilty and the delivery guy reacted negatively shows it's not neutral. Also, the wife's perspective is important because she's part of their household and their relationship. Her disapproval indicates that it's affecting their home dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the person might argue that they didn't intend to offend and were trying to be polite by not keeping the delivery waiting. However, the discomfort caused is a valid reason to reconsider the action. The right thing here might be to balance politeness with respect for others' comfort. So, the person might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the delivery person's feelings and their partner's perspective. The solution could be to dress before answering the door to avoid such situations.\n"
