I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author answered the door in their boxers for a pizza delivery person, and the delivery person seemed uncomfortable. The author's wife criticized them for it, and now they're wondering if they're wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many cultures, answering the door in just underwear might be considered inappropriate, especially in front of strangers. It's common to wear at least some clothing, like a robe or pants, when opening the door. The pizza guy's reaction\u2014stepping back\u2014suggests he felt awkward or uncomfortable, which the author acknowledges. The wife's opinion adds another layer, as she's close to the author and might have a good sense of their usual behavior.\n\nThe author argues that they thought delivery people see worse, so it's not a big deal. But that's a bit of an excuse. Just because someone might be accustomed to seeing various situations doesn't mean it's acceptable to put them in an uncomfortable position. Respect and consideration for others' feelings matter here. The author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, could be seen as inconsiderate or disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't intend to offend. They might have been in a hurry or not thought about it. However, the key point is that they caused discomfort. Even if unintentional, causing someone to feel awkward can be considered wrong. The author's wife's reaction supports the idea that this isn't just their personal opinion but a valid concern.\n\nSo, balancing intentions and outcomes, the outcome here is that the delivery person was uncomfortable. The author should have taken the time to dress appropriately, even if it was inconvenient. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
