I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who answered the door in their boxers is in the wrong. The situation is that they usually do this when they don't have pants ready, thinking that delivery people have seen worse, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many cultures, answering the door in just underwear is considered inappropriate, especially for strangers. Even if delivery people might be used to seeing various situations, that doesn't mean it's acceptable. The key here is the discomfort it caused the delivery person. The author's wife called it \"shitty,\" which is a strong term indicating she felt it was rude or inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that they didn't want to make the delivery person wait, but the expectation is that people should dress appropriately when opening the door to strangers. There's an assumption that delivery people are okay with seeing anything, but that's a harmful stereotype and not respectful. The discomfort reaction shows that the action was indeed inappropriate.\n\nThe author's wife's reaction adds weight to the idea that this behavior is considered wrong in their household. Even if the author didn't intend to offend, the act of being underdressed for a delivery can be seen as disrespectful to the delivery person's job and personal space. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given the discomfort caused and societal expectations, the answer would lean towards yes.\n"
