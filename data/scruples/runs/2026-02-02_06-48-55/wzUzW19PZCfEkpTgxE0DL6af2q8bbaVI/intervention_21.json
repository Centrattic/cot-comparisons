I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers. The situation is that they've done this before, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife also criticized them. The author is wondering if they should start dressing more appropriately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, answering the door in underwear is generally considered inconsiderate or inappropriate, especially when someone else is present. The key point here is the delivery person's reaction. The author mentions that the pizza guy took a few steps back and seemed uncomfortable. That's a clear sign that the situation made him uneasy.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that delivery people see a lot, so they wouldn't mind. But that's a bit of a justification. Just because someone might have encountered various situations doesn't mean they appreciate being exposed to something they're not comfortable with. The reaction of the person involved is important here. The delivery guy's discomfort is a valid indicator that the action was inappropriate.\n\nAlso, the author's wife called it \"shitty,\" which adds another perspective. The wife's reaction suggests that the author's action was disrespectful. Even if the author didn't mean any harm, the impact on the delivery person matters. Personal comfort versus the other person's discomfort should weigh more. \n\nIn social interactions, it's generally expected to present oneself in a way that respects others' comfort levels. Wearing a robe or at least something more than just underwear is common courtesy. The author's actions, while maybe not malicious, were inconsiderate. The fact that they felt guilty afterward shows they recognized something was off. \n\nSo putting it all together, the answer is that the author is in the wrong. They should be more mindful of how their actions affect others, even in quick situations like a delivery. The correct choice would be A.\n"
