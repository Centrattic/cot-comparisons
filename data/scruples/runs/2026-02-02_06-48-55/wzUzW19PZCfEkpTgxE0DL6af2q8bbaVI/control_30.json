I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who answered the door in their boxers was in the wrong. The situation is that they've done this before without issues, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife is upset, and the person is wondering if they should start dressing more formally for deliveries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many places, people might answer the door in casual attire, especially if they're expecting a delivery. However, others might find it inappropriate. The key here is the reaction of the delivery person. The pizza guy was clearly uncomfortable, so that's a sign that the person's actions affected him negatively.\n\nThe author mentions that they thought delivery people have seen worse, but maybe that's a flawed assumption. Not everyone is comfortable with being exposed to someone in underwear, even if they're used to it. The fact that the delivery person took steps back shows he wasn't okay with it.\n\nThe author's wife is also critical, which adds another perspective. The spouse's opinion can be a significant factor in determining what's socially acceptable within a relationship. If the wife is upset, that's a personal relationship issue to consider.\n\nAnother angle is respect and consideration. Even if it's common, the person should consider how others might feel. The delivery person's job is to provide a service, and being greeted inappropriately could make them feel uncomfortable or disrespected. The author's intention was to not keep the person waiting, which is kind, but the method might not be appropriate.\n\nI should also think about cultural context. In some cultures, it's more acceptable to be in casual wear at home, but in others, there's an expectation to be more presentable when receiving guests, even if they're just delivering something. The author's location might influence this, but since it's unspecified, I have to go with general norms.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on balancing personal convenience against others' comfort. Since the delivery person was visibly uncomfortable and the wife is upset, it's likely that the author should adjust their behavior. The act of answering the door in underwear isn't inherently wrong, but in this context, it caused discomfort, so they might be in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes) because the author's actions, while perhaps common, caused discomfort to the delivery person, and there's a responsibility to consider others' feelings in such interactions.\n"
