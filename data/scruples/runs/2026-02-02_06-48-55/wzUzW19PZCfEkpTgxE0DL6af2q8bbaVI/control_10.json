I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers for a pizza delivery guy. The writer mentions doing this a few times before, and while others didn't react much, this time the pizza guy was clearly uncomfortable. The wife also criticized them for it, and they're considering if they should dress more for such situations.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The main issue here is whether the writer acted inappropriately by opening the door in a state of undress. The key factors are the delivery person's reaction and social norms. The writer's intention was to not be rude and to be prompt, but the result caused discomfort. \n\nIn many cultures, answering the door in underwear is generally considered okay when it's a service worker like a pizza delivery person, especially if it's a quick transaction. However, there's a difference between it being acceptable and causing someone to feel uncomfortable. The fact that the pizza guy took steps back and seemed uncomfortable suggests that the writer's attire did cause some level of discomfort, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe wife's reaction is another point to consider. If they have a discussion about it and she feels it's inconsiderate, that's a personal relationship issue. But from a societal standpoint, there's no strict rule that one must be fully dressed when opening the door for a delivery. However, there's also a responsibility to consider others' feelings. While the writer may not have meant to offend, the discomfort of the delivery person is something they should take into account. \n\nOn the other hand, the writer might argue that they were just being practical and that service workers are used to such situations. There are stories and experiences where people have done similar things without issue. But the fact that this time it was different, and the delivery person's reaction was noticeable, implies that maybe the writer should adjust their behavior to avoid causing discomfort. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether causing discomfort, even if unintentional, is inconsiderate. If the writer is aware that their actions might affect others, even if it's a common occurrence, then there's a case to be made for them being in the wrong in this specific instance. However, it's also a matter of personal choice and societal norms varying. \n\nBut given the context\u2014the delivery person's clear discomfort and the wife's criticism\u2014it's likely that there's a reasonable argument the author was inconsiderate, even if not necessarily \"in the wrong\" in a legal or moral sense. The question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which can be subjective. \n\nIn some cases, people might say the author isn't wrong because they were just being quick and service workers are accustomed to various situations. But others might say that even if it's common, it's still considerate to dress more appropriately, especially when it's clear that someone is uncomfortable. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes), because while it's common, the delivery person's reaction indicates that the author's choice caused discomfort, and there's no harm in being more considerate by taking the time to dress. The author's wife also thought it was shitty, which adds to the perspective that they should change their behavior.\n"
