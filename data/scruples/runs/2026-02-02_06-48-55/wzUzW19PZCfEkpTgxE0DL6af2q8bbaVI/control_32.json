I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who answered the door in their boxers is in the wrong. The situation involves them answering the door for a pizza delivery guy in just their underwear, which made the delivery person uncomfortable. The person's wife criticized them for it, and now they're questioning if they should change their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many places, it's common for people to answer the door in less formal clothing, especially for deliveries. However, the key here is that the delivery person was visibly uncomfortable. That's a red flag. Even if it's common, causing someone else discomfort is a problem.\n\nThen there's the aspect of respect and consideration. The person's reasoning was that they didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting, which shows they wanted to be polite. However, not dressing appropriately could be seen as disrespectful or unprofessional to the delivery worker. The wife's reaction also adds another perspective\u2014she felt it was \"shitty\" of him, which might reflect societal expectations of dressing appropriately when opening the door for service workers.\n\nThe user mentions that they thought delivery people have seen worse, but that's a flawed assumption. Just because someone has encountered various situations doesn't mean they should be subjected to things that make them uncomfortable. Everyone has a threshold for what they find acceptable. The fact that the pizza guy physically stepped back indicates he was genuinely uncomfortable, which the person should have noticed and adjusted their behavior.\n\nAlso, the person's own guilt after the incident suggests they recognized something was off. Feeling guilty is a sign that their actions might not align with their values or societal expectations. They should consider that their actions, even if well-intentioned, can have unintended negative effects on others.\n\nIn terms of solutions, the person could start dressing more appropriately before answering the door, even if it means taking a few extra minutes. This would show respect for the delivery person's comfort and professionalism. It's a small change that can prevent awkward situations and mutual discomfort.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the person's actions, while perhaps common, caused discomfort to the delivery person. They should be more mindful of how their choice of clothing affects others, even if it's just for a quick delivery. The answer would be that they are in the wrong because their actions, though not malicious, were inconsiderate and disrespectful.\n"
