I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The situation is that they've done this before without issues, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife called it \"shitty\" and the author is now questioning their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, answering the door in underwear is generally considered inappropriate, even if it's common. The author might have thought that delivery people have seen worse, but that's not a valid excuse because it's still the customer's responsibility to dress appropriately when answering the door. \n\nThen there's the reaction of the pizza guy. He physically stepped back, indicating discomfort. That's a sign that the author's actions were making him uncomfortable. The author's wife also disapproved, which adds to the idea that it's not acceptable. \n\nThe key points here are respect and consideration. Even if the author thought it was fine before, this instance shows that it can affect others negatively. The author should prioritize dressing properly to avoid making others feel uncomfortable. \n\nSo, the author's actions, while maybe not malicious, are inconsiderate and go against social etiquette. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
