I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who answered the door in boxers was in the wrong. The situation involves a pizza delivery guy who became uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the person's reasoning was that they didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting. They mentioned that they usually do this when they don't have pants on and that they thought delivery people see worse stuff, so it's okay. But this time, the guy was clearly uncomfortable, even stepping back. The wife called it \"shitty\" of them to do that.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider societal norms and respect. Even if the delivery person has seen worse, it's still about the other person's comfort. The author's action might not be illegal, but it's about being considerate. The key here is the reaction of the delivery person. If someone is visibly uncomfortable, causing that discomfort could be seen as inconsiderate, even if it's unintentional.\n\nThe wife's reaction suggests she believes it's wrong. The author's justification is that they thought it was acceptable based on previous experiences, but that might not account for individual differences in what people find acceptable. The delivery person's discomfort is a valid indicator that the action was inappropriate in this instance.\n\nSo, even though the author might not have intended to offend, the act of answering the door in undergarments when it causes discomfort to another person can be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they failed to consider the delivery person's reaction, despite their own reasoning.\n"
