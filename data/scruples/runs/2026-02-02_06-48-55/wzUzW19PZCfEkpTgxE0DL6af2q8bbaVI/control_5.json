I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers. The situation is that he answered the door for the pizza guy in boxers a few times before, but this time the delivery person was uncomfortable and stepped back. His wife said it was shitty of him, and he's wondering if he should start dressing more fully.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if he did something wrong. The key points here are about social norms, respect, and consideration for others. Opening the door in just boxers is a common scenario, but it's generally considered polite to be somewhat dressed when answering the door for strangers or service workers. While he might have thought that delivery people have seen worse, the reaction of the pizza guy being uncomfortable and stepping back suggests that it was indeed an issue for him. The wife's opinion also adds a perspective that it was inconsiderate.\n\nSocial norms often dictate that when someone is in your home, even partially dressed, they should consider the comfort of others. Even if it's common for delivery people to encounter various situations, the fact that this particular person was uncomfortable means that the author's actions affected him negatively. The author's intention was to be polite by not making the delivery person wait, but the outcome caused discomfort, which might mean he was inconsiderate despite good intentions.\n\nSo, the question is whether his actions crossed a line. The answer hinges on whether being in boxers is considered inappropriate for answering the door for a service worker. In many cultures, it's seen as impolite to answer the door in underwear, especially for someone outside the household. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider the other person's feelings and the standard of dressing appropriately when interacting with others in their home.\n\nHowever, factors like the frequency of the action and the delivery person's reaction could influence the judgment. If it's a one-time thing and the delivery person was just particularly uncomfortable, maybe it's a minor issue. But the wife's criticism and the delivery person's reaction suggest that it's better to dress more appropriately to avoid such situations. Hence, the answer might be A (in the wrong).\n"
