I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers for a pizza delivery.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and etiquette. Generally, when someone comes to your door, especially a delivery person, it's considered polite to be decently dressed. Boxers might be considered underwear, which is not appropriate for answering the door. There's a common expectation of being presentable, even if it's just for a quick delivery.\n\nThe author mentions that the pizza guy was uncomfortable and physically stepped back. That's a key point. The delivery person's reaction suggests they felt uneasy, which the author might have sensed, leading to their guilt. The wife also called it \"shitty,\" which adds another perspective that this might be considered rude or inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that delivery workers see worse, so it's okay. But even if that's true, it doesn't excuse the action. Everyone has a threshold, and making someone uncomfortable is still wrong. The author's actions caused the delivery person distress, which is a valid reason to reconsider the behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author thought they were being considerate by not making the delivery wait longer. But there's a balance between politeness to the delivery person and maintaining appropriate dress. The solution could be to put on pants quickly, even if it's just at home. It's a small effort that shows respect for the other person's comfort.\n\nAlso, the author's wife's reaction is important. It's not just about the delivery person's feelings but also about how close family views the action. The wife's disapproval might indicate that the author is in the wrong in their household's context.\n\nIn summary, while the author might not have intended to offend, the action did cause discomfort. The expectation of being decently dressed for visitors is a social norm that the author ignored here. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
