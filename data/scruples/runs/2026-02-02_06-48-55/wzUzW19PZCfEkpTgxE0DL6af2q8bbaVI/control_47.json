I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who answered the door in their boxers is in the wrong. The situation is that they answered the door for the pizza guy in their underwear because they didn't have pants on and didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting. The pizza guy was uncomfortable and stepped back. The wife called it shitty, and the person is now questioning if they should change their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many cultures, answering the door in underwear or boxers is generally considered inappropriate, especially for someone outside the household like a delivery person. It's respectful to cover up when opening the door for strangers or service providers. The person might not have intended to offend, but the reaction of the pizza guy indicates that it made him uncomfortable. The wife's disapproval also suggests that there's a social expectation to dress appropriately even at home when someone is at the door.\n\nAnother angle is the perspective of the delivery person. They come into contact with many customers, but that doesn't mean they should be exposed to situations that make them uncomfortable. It's reasonable to expect that someone would want to present themselves in a respectful manner, even if it's just for a quick transaction.\n\nThe person's reasoning was that they've seen stories of delivery people seeing worse, so they thought it was okay. But that's a bit of a fallacy because just because someone has seen worse doesn't mean they should be subjected to anything that's inconsiderate. The key here is intention versus impact. The person didn't mean to be rude, but the impact on the delivery person was negative. The wife's reaction also points out that it was inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the person is in the wrong. They should make an effort to dress more appropriately when opening the door for others, even if it's just to avoid causing discomfort. Answering the door in underwear breaches a common courtesy, even if it's not a major issue. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
