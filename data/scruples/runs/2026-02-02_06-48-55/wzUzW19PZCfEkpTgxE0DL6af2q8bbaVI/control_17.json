I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author of the AITA post) is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers for the pizza delivery guy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, people answer the door in whatever they're wearing if they're home alone and it's just a delivery. Boxers aren't that revealing compared to, say, being naked. But the pizza guy was uncomfortable, so maybe the author should have considered that.\n\nThe wife's reaction is important too. She called it \"shitty,\" which suggests she thinks it's inconsiderate. But her perspective might be more about the author's behavior rather than the delivery person's reaction. \n\nThe author's reasoning was that delivery people have seen worse, so they wouldn't mind. That's a common defense, but it's a bit of a generalization. Not everyone is comfortable with seeing someone in underwear, even if they've seen worse. The key point is the immediate discomfort the delivery guy showed. If the person on the other side of the door felt uncomfortable, maybe the author should have taken a moment to dress more appropriately.\n\nAlso, the act of answering the door quickly to minimize interaction might not be enough. The delivery person's reaction shows that the situation was awkward for them, which could be seen as impolite. The author's actions might have made the delivery person feel uneasy, which is something to consider.\n\nIn terms of accountability, it's about respect for others' comfort. While the author didn't intend to be rude, the outcome was someone else's discomfort. It's a gray area, but since the delivery person was clearly affected, the author might be in the wrong for not anticipating that.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
