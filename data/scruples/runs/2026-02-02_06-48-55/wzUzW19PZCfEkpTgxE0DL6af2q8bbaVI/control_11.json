I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they answered the door in their boxers for a pizza delivery guy. The pizza guy got uncomfortable and stepped back. The wife is upset, and the person is questioning if they should have dressed more.\n\nFirst, I need to think about social norms. Answering the door in underwear is something some people do when they're in a hurry, but is it acceptable? It depends on the context. If it's a delivery person, they might expect a variety of situations, but being in boxers could still be considered inappropriate, especially if it makes the person uncomfortable. The key point here is that the pizza guy was clearly uncomfortable. That's a sign that the action crossed a line, even if the person didn't intend it.\n\nThe wife's reaction is another factor. She called it \"shitty,\" which is a strong term. That suggests she sees it as a breach of etiquette. Also, the person mentions they thought delivery people see worse, but maybe they shouldn't assume that. Even if some have seen worse, it's still possible to be respectful without assuming tolerance.\n\nAnother angle is the responsibility to consider others' feelings. The author might not have intended to upset the pizza guy, but the fact that they did is important. The action was rude, not because of the clothing itself, but because it made someone uncomfortable. The author should consider that even if they don't dress formally, wearing something more appropriate like a robe or pants would be better.\n\nAlso, the act of answering the door quickly to minimize interaction might not be enough if the initial appearance is already causing discomfort. The author's justification that they were trying to be polite by not making the delivery person wait is understandable, but there's a balance between politeness and respect for others' comfort.\n\nIn terms of etiquette, most guidelines suggest dressing appropriately when answering the door, even if it's just for deliveries. Wearing underwear or minimal clothing can be seen as unprofessional or disrespectful. The pizza guy's job is to deliver food, not to be subjected to awkward situations. The author's actions might have made that person feel uneasy, which is something to take responsibility for.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong. They didn't consider the delivery person's comfort, and their wife's criticism is valid. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
