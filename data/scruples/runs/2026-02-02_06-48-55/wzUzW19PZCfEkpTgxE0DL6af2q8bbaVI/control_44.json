I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers. The author has done this before when they can't find pants, figuring that delivery people have seen worse and wouldn't mind. However, this time the pizza guy was clearly uncomfortable, and the wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms and social expectations. In many places, answering the door in underwear is considered inappropriate, especially for strangers. Even if the person has done it before without issues, this instance was different because the delivery person showed discomfort. The author's wife is also critical, which adds another perspective\u2014family's opinion matters in such situations.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that delivery people are used to seeing various situations, but this might not be a valid assumption. Just because someone is a delivery person doesn't mean they are comfortable with seeing customers in underwear. The key point is that the author made the delivery person uncomfortable, which is a red flag. The author's actions led to someone else feeling uneasy, which is generally considered inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling guilty afterward. That guilt indicates an awareness that their actions might not have been appropriate. The wife's reaction reinforces that there's a problem. While the author's intention was to be polite by not making the delivery person wait, the method used was flawed. There are other ways to be polite, like asking the delivery person to wait a minute while they get dressed.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should consider others' feelings and comfort. Public spaces and interactions require a level of modesty and respect for others. Even if the author didn't mean to offend, the impact on the delivery person is what matters here. The fact that the delivery person took steps back shows a clear discomfort, which the author should take into account.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions caused discomfort to another person, and their justification (assuming delivery people have seen worse) isn't a solid excuse. The wife's criticism is valid because it's about showing respect and consideration. Therefore, the author is in the wrong and should adjust their behavior.\n"
