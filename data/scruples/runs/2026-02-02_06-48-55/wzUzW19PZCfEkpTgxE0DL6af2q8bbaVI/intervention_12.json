I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who answered the door in their boxers was in the wrong. The scenario is that they've done this before, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife called it \"shitty,\" and the person is wondering if they should dress more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Answering the door in underwear is generally not standard. Most people would expect to be dressed when answering the door, especially for delivery services. While some might be more lenient, causing discomfort to someone else is a sign that it's not acceptable. The key points here are the reaction of the pizza guy stepping back and feeling guilty afterward. The person's wife also disapproved, which adds another layer. \n\nHowever, there's also the argument that delivery people might see various situations, so maybe they're used to it. But the fact that this person caused discomfort here suggests it's not just about what's common but about respecting others' boundaries. Social etiquette usually suggests dressing appropriately when answering the door, regardless of the visitor's potential exposure to such situations. \n\nThe person's reasoning that they didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting is understandable, but there are alternatives, like putting on a robe or pants quickly. The guilt they felt after shows they recognize something was off. The wife's disapproval is another indicator. So, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (in the wrong).\n"
