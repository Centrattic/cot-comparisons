I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who answered the door in their boxers is wrong. They did it before without issues, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife says it's shitty, but the person thought delivery people see worse.\n\nHmm, so the main points are: 1) The person answers the door in boxers when pants aren't ready. 2) The pizza guy was clearly uncomfortable. 3) The wife is upset, and the person questions their own actions. \n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, answering the door in underwear is considered inappropriate, even if the person is just delivering something. It can be seen as indecent exposure, depending on local laws. Even if it's common for delivery people to see various situations, it's still a private moment for the person at home. \n\nThe key here is the reaction of the pizza guy. He took steps back, which indicates discomfort. That suggests the action affected him negatively. The person might not have intended harm, but causing someone else to feel uncomfortable is a valid concern. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is important. Her disapproval shows that within their household, this is a boundary they should respect. Even if the person didn't see any issues before, the fact that this time it caused a problem and their spouse is upset makes it a matter of respect and consideration.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for harassment or making someone feel unsafe. Even if the person didn't mean any harm, it's about how the other person perceives it. The pizza guy's physical reaction indicates he felt uneasy, which might be enough to consider the action as wrong.\n\nSo, even if the person thought it was fine before, the consequences here (the guy's discomfort and the wife's disapproval) suggest that they should reassess their actions. The correct approach would be to dress appropriately before answering the door to avoid making anyone uncomfortable, regardless of past experiences. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
