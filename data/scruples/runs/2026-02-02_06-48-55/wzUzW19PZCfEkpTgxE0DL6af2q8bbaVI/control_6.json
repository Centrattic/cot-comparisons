I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The situation is that the pizza guy was uncomfortable and physically stepped back. The author's wife called it \"shitty,\" and they're questioning if they should start dressing more formally for deliveries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many cultures, answering the door in underwear isn't considered appropriate for strangers, even if they're delivery people. While some might be desensitized, the fact that this pizza guy was uncomfortable suggests that it's not a universal experience. The author's intention wasn't to offend, but the result was that someone felt uneasy. \n\nThen there's the aspect of respect. The author wanted to avoid keeping the person waiting, which is thoughtful, but maybe there's a balance between politeness and maintaining boundaries. The wife's reaction indicates that she thinks the author overstepped, which adds weight to the idea that it's not just about the action but also how others perceive it.\n\nThe author mentions that they thought delivery people \"have seen worse,\" but that's a generalization. It's possible that not everyone is okay with being exposed to someone in underwear. The key here is the reaction of the individual involved. Since this particular person was clearly uncomfortable, the author's action, while perhaps well-intentioned, caused an issue.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether causing discomfort to another person is justified by the convenience of not delaying the delivery. Since the author's action led to the other person's discomfort, it's reasonable to say that they should be more mindful in the future. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong, leaning towards answer A.\n"
