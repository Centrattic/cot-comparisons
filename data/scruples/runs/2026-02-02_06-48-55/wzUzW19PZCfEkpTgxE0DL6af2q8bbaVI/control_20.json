I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers to a pizza delivery person. The author did this a few times before and thought it was okay because they didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting. But this time, the pizza guy was uncomfortable and stepped back. The wife is upset, and the author is wondering if they should start dressing more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. Wearing underwear to the door is a personal choice, but it's generally considered inappropriate to be fully exposed. Boxers are underwear, so even if you're not naked, it's still not typical attire for a public interaction. The key here is that the delivery person was clearly uncomfortable. That's a red flag. Even if the author didn't mean any harm, causing someone else discomfort is a problem.\n\nThen there's the wife's reaction. She called it \"shitty,\" which implies she finds it inconsiderate. Relationships matter here, so if the wife is upset, that's a point in favor of the author being in the wrong. The author should consider their partner's feelings.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that delivery people see worse, so it's okay. But that's a bit of a defense mechanism. Just because someone might be desensitized doesn't mean it's acceptable. Everyone has a threshold for what they find comfortable. The pizza guy's reaction shows that the author crossed that line here.\n\nAlso, the situation involves a stranger. While it's common to be more casual with delivery people, there's still an expectation of basic modesty. The author's intention was to be polite by not making them wait, but the method was inappropriate. They should have either put on pants quickly or asked the delivery person to wait a minute while they dressed.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, were inconsiderate and caused discomfort. The wife's criticism is valid, and the delivery person's reaction supports that. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
