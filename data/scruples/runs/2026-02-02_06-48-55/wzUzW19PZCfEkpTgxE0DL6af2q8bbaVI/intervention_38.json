I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The author has done this before, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife said it was shitty, and the author is wondering if they should start dressing more when answering the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. In many cultures, answering the door in underwear or just boxers is generally considered inappropriate, especially when expecting a delivery. While some people might be more accepting, others find it offensive or uncomfortable. The key here is that the pizza guy showed clear discomfort, stepping back. That's a strong reaction indicating the author's actions were off-putting.\n\nThe author mentions that they thought delivery people have seen worse, but that's an assumption. Just because someone has encountered various situations doesn't mean they are okay with all of them. The wife's reaction also suggests that the author's behavior is not acceptable in their household.\n\nAnother angle is respect and professionalism. Delivery workers are professionals doing their job, and showing up in minimal clothing might be seen as disrespectful. It's about considering the other person's comfort and maintaining a level of decorum in public interactions.\n\nThe author's justification is that they don't want to keep the delivery person waiting, but there are alternative solutions, like putting on a robe or a shirt quickly instead of just boxers. Choosing to answer the door in such attire is a choice, and the discomfort caused is a valid reason to reconsider that choice.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, have caused discomfort to the delivery person and their wife is upset. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not considering the other person's feelings in this situation.\n"
