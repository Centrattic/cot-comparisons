I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers for a pizza delivery guy. The author mentions that they've done this before with no issues, but this time the delivery person was uncomfortable. Their wife called it \"shitty\" of them, and the author is now wondering if they should dress up more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many places, answering the door in underwear is generally not acceptable for strangers, especially delivery personnel. Even if the person is just delivering a pizza, they're a stranger, and showing up in boxers might be considered inappropriate. The fact that the delivery guy took steps back and was uncomfortable suggests that the author's actions made him feel uneasy. \n\nThen there's the aspect of respect and professionalism. Delivery workers are doing a job and might not want to see customers in a state of undress. The author might not have intended to cause discomfort, but the result was that the delivery guy felt that way. The author's wife also criticized the action, which adds another layer of social judgment.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's a minor situation and that delivery people are used to seeing various situations. But the key point is the delivery person's reaction here was negative. The author is now feeling guilty, which implies they recognize that it might not have been appropriate.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the author probably is in the wrong. They should consider dressing more appropriately when answering for strangers to avoid making others uncomfortable. The answer would be A.\n"
