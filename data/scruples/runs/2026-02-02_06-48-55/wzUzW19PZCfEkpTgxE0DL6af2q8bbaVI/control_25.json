I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers for a pizza delivery guy. The situation is that the author has done this before without issues, but this time the pizza guy was clearly uncomfortable, stepping back. The author feels guilty and the wife is upset. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Generally, people might expect that when someone comes to their door for a delivery, they should be decently dressed. However, it's also common for people to answer the door in casual clothing, like underwear or boxers, especially if they're at home and it's a quick delivery. The key here is the reaction of the pizza guy. He was uncomfortable and physically stepped back, which indicates that the author's attire made him uneasy. \n\nThe author mentions that they thought it was okay because they've heard delivery people see worse, but this time was different. The wife's reaction also points out that it was \"shitty\" of them. So there's a conflict between the author's perception and the actual reaction of the delivery person and their spouse. \n\nIt's important to consider respect and consideration for others. Even if the author didn't intend to cause discomfort, the fact that it did happen means that their actions had a negative effect on someone else. The author's justification that they didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting is valid, but maybe there's a more considerate approach. For example, putting on a robe or something over the boxers to cover up while still being quick.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their appearance might affect the delivery person. While it's a common practice for some people to answer in casual attire, the key factor here is the negative reaction. The author's wife's criticism adds another layer, suggesting that their spouse values modesty in such situations.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they were being accommodating and didn't mean to offend. However, the discomfort caused is still a valid concern. The decision to dress more appropriately in the future would be a reasonable step to prevent such situations.\n\nSo, weighing the factors: the author's actions caused discomfort to the delivery person, their spouse disapproved, and while it's a common scenario, the specific reaction here indicates a problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering the other person's feelings in this instance.\n"
