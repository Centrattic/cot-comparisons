I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers. The situation is that they usually do this when they don't have pants on, thinking it's okay because pizza delivery people probably see worse. But this time, the pizza guy was clearly uncomfortable. The wife thinks it's shitty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, especially in Western cultures, answering the door in just underwear might be considered inappropriate. Even if delivery people are used to seeing various situations, it's still the customer's home, and they should respect the delivery person's comfort. The fact that the pizza guy stepped back and was uncomfortable suggests that the interaction was awkward for him. The author might not have intended to make him uncomfortable, but the reaction indicates it happened anyway.\n\nAlso, the author's wife's reaction is a point. She said it's shitty, which means someone close to him thinks it's wrong. The author's reasoning that delivery people have seen worse might be a way to justify it, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. Respecting others' boundaries and comfort is important. Even if it's a quick interaction, showing up in underwear could be seen as a lack of consideration for the delivery person's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because it's their home, and they might not realize how others perceive it. But generally, society expects a certain level of dress when opening the door for strangers. So, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't consider the delivery person's feelings, even if unintentionally.\n"
