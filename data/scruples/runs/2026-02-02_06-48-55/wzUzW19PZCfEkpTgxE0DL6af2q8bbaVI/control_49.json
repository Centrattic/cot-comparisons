I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who answered the door in their boxers is in the wrong. The situation is that they did this a few times before, but this time the pizza guy was clearly uncomfortable. Their wife told them it was \"shitty\" to do so, and they're now wondering if they should start dressing more appropriately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many cultures, answering the door in underwear might be seen as inappropriate, especially in public interactions. While some people might be desensitized to such things, others could find it uncomfortable or disrespectful. The key here is the reaction of the pizza guy. He took steps back, which indicates discomfort. That's a red flag.\n\nNext, the wife's reaction is important. She's his spouse, and her opinion matters in their household. If she feels it's wrong, there's a valid perspective there. The author's reasoning was that pizza delivery people see worse, so it's fine. But that's a bit of a generalization. Assuming others are fine with it doesn't make it okay; individual reactions can vary.\n\nAlso, respect and consideration for others' feelings should be a factor. Even if the author didn't intend to offend, the action did cause discomfort. The principle here is about being considerate. If there's a way to avoid making someone uncomfortable, especially in a professional interaction, it's better to take that step. \n\nHowever, there's a counterpoint: if the author is in their home and the interaction is brief, maybe it's not a big deal. But the fact that the recipient (the pizza guy) felt uncomfortable overshadows that. The right thing to do is to avoid causing unnecessary discomfort, even in mundane situations.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions did cause discomfort, and their wife's disapproval adds weight. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they should consider others' feelings and adjust their behavior to prevent discomfort, even if they didn't mean to.\n"
