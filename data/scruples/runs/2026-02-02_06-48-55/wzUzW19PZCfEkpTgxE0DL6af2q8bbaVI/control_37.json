I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who answered the door in boxers was in the wrong. The situation involves a pizza delivery guy reacting with discomfort. The person's wife criticized them for it, and they're now questioning their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. Generally, answering the door in underwear, while not illegal, might be seen as inconsiderate depending on the context. The key points here are that the pizza guy was uncomfortable and physically stepped back, which indicates the person's actions made him uneasy. The author's reasoning was that delivery people see a lot, so they wouldn't mind, but this seems to be a case of an individual reaction.\n\nThe author's wife's disapproval is another angle. She called it \"shitty,\" which suggests that in their household, this behavior isn't acceptable. Personal boundaries and respect for others' comfort levels are important here. Even if the author hadn't intended to offend, the act of being semi-naked in front of a delivery person can be seen as inappropriate or disrespectful, especially if it's causing someone else discomfort.\n\nThe author's past actions of doing this before without noticing a reaction might indicate a lack of awareness. However, in this specific case, the reaction was clear. The fact that the author felt guilty afterward shows some self-awareness, which is a positive sign. But the question is whether they were in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, it's generally advised to present oneself in a manner that respects the other person's comfort. While it's not a major transgression, being in boxers at the door could be considered inconsiderate. The answer might depend on cultural norms too. In some places, it's more casual, but in others, it's seen as inappropriate.\n\nThe author's justification that delivery people see worse might not hold because even if they're accustomed to various situations, that doesn't mean they should be exposed to things that make them uncomfortable. The key is that the person's actions directly caused the pizza guy discomfort, which is a valid reason to reconsider such behavior.\n\nSo, balancing the lack of intent to harm against the actual discomfort caused, it's likely the author is in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
