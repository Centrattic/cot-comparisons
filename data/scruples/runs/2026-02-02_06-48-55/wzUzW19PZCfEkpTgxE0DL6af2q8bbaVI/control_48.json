I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person answered the door in just their boxers for a pizza delivery. They mention that they've done it before and didn't notice a reaction, but this time the delivery guy was uncomfortable. Their wife thinks it's \"shitty\" of them.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a social norm perspective, answering the door in underwear is generally considered inappropriate, especially when it makes the other person uncomfortable. Even if they think delivery people have seen worse, the key here is that this particular person was visibly uncomfortable. The author's wife also disapproves, which adds a personal relationship angle. The author might not have intended to offend, but causing someone discomfort is still a valid concern. So, while it's not a major transgression, it's a breach of social etiquette, making the author at least partially at fault. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
