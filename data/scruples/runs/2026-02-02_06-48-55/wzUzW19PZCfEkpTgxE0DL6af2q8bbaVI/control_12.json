I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The situation is that they answered the door for a pizza delivery guy in their underwear, the guy was uncomfortable, and the wife called it shitty. The author is wondering if they should dress more when answering the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, it's common for people to answer the door in minimal clothing, especially for deliveries. However, there's also a growing awareness about respecting others' comfort levels and boundaries. The pizza guy's reaction here is key\u2014taking a step back indicates he felt uncomfortable. Even if the author didn't intend to cause discomfort, causing someone else to feel uneasy could be a problem.\n\nThe wife's reaction also plays a role. She's saying it's inconsiderate, which adds a personal perspective. The author mentions they thought delivery people see worse, but maybe that's not a valid excuse. Just because someone might be exposed to various situations doesn't mean they should be forced to see something they're uncomfortable with. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasoning is that they don't want to keep the delivery person waiting. That's understandable, but is it worth the other person's discomfort? There's a balance between politeness and respecting others. Maybe there's a middle ground, like putting on a robe or something more appropriate quickly. \n\nI should also think about cultural differences. In some cultures, being seen in underwear by a delivery person might be more accepted, while in others, it's considered inappropriate. The post doesn't specify the culture, so assuming a general Western context where there's more emphasis on personal space and avoiding causing discomfort.\n\nSo, the author didn't intend harm, but the action did cause discomfort. Whether that makes them wrong depends on whether causing discomfort is considered a fault. In many social contexts, being considerate and avoiding making others uncomfortable is valued. So, the author might be in the wrong for not anticipating the other person's discomfort and not taking steps to avoid it. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes).\n"
