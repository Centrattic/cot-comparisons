I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who answered the door in their boxers is in the wrong. The situation is that they answered the door for a pizza delivery person in just their underwear, which made the delivery person uncomfortable. The wife is upset about it, and the person is questioning if they should have dressed more appropriately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. In many cultures, answering the door in underwear isn't typically considered appropriate for someone outside the household, especially a delivery person. While it's a quick delivery, the delivery person is a professional, and the customer's appearance can affect their comfort and job. The person in the story mentions they've done this before without issues, but this time the employee was clearly uncomfortable. \n\nThen there's the aspect of respect and professionalism. Delivery workers are doing their job, and encountering a customer in such a state might make them feel uneasy or disrespected, even if the customer didn't intend to. The wife's reaction suggests that there's a societal expectation to present oneself decently when there's an interaction with others, even if it's just for a delivery.\n\nAlso, considering the perspective of the delivery person, they might have to deal with various situations, but that doesn't mean they should be put in an uncomfortable position. The person's argument that delivery workers have seen worse is a common one, but it's important to recognize that every individual has different thresholds for what they find acceptable. Just because someone else might be okay with it doesn't mean it's right to make another person uncomfortable.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the customer has a duty to respect the delivery person by presenting themselves appropriately. The act of answering the door in underwear isn't just about modesty but about maintaining a respectful interaction. The guilt the person feels after realizing the discomfort they caused indicates an awareness of the social norm they've breached.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the person did act in a way that, while perhaps not malicious, was inconsiderate of the delivery person's comfort. The wife's criticism is valid because it's about respecting others in a professional interaction. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
