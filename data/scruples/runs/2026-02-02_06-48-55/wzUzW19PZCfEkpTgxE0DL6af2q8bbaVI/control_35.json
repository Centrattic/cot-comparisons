I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person answered the door in their boxers for a pizza delivery. They mention they've done it before without issues, but this time the delivery guy was uncomfortable. The wife criticized them for it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, consider social norms. Opening the door in undergarments is generally seen as inappropriate in many cultures. Even if delivery people might be used to seeing various situations, it's still a professional interaction. The key here is the other person's comfort. The pizza guy took steps back and seemed uncomfortable, which indicates that the action affected him negatively. \n\nThe author's reasoning was that they didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting, but there are alternatives. For example, they could have waited a few minutes to put on clothes. The wife's reaction also points out that it's considerate to dress appropriately, even at home. \n\nWhile the author might not have intended harm, the act still caused discomfort. The responsibility lies in being mindful of others' feelings. In public interactions, even if brief, maintaining a certain level of decorum is expected. So, even if it's a small oversight, the author should consider changing their behavior to respect others' comfort.\n"
