I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who answered the door in their boxers is in the wrong. The situation is that they answered the door for the pizza guy in their underwear a few times before, but this time the delivery person seemed uncomfortable. The wife called it shitty, and the person is now questioning if they should dress more when answering the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Generally, answering the door in underwear isn't the most respectful thing, especially for someone you don't know. While pizza delivery people might be used to seeing all sorts of things, that doesn't mean they appreciate it. The key point here is respect for the delivery person's comfort and privacy.\n\nThe person's argument is that they thought it was okay because they've heard stories from delivery workers implying they've seen worse. However, that's not a good justification. Just because someone is accustomed to a situation doesn't mean it's acceptable. The reaction of the person being uncomfortable is a red flag. The author should have considered that their actions might make the delivery person feel uneasy, even if they didn't intend to.\n\nThe wife's reaction also points out that it's not appropriate. The author's habit of doing this when pants aren't ready might be convenient, but convenience shouldn't override courtesy. It's reasonable to take the extra few minutes to put on clothes before answering the door for someone else. \n\nAlso, there's a gender aspect here. If the delivery person was male and the author is male, it's possible that the situation could have been awkward. But the main issue is about mutual respect and not making others uncomfortable. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author didn't have malicious intent, their actions were inconsiderate of the delivery person's feelings. They should be in the wrong for not respecting the other person's comfort. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
