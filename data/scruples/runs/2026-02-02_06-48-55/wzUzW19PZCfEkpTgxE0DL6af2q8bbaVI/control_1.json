I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that they answered the door for the pizza delivery guy in their boxers, which made the delivery person uncomfortable. Their wife criticized them for it, and the person is wondering if they should start dressing more appropriately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around answering the door in underwear. In many places, it's common for people to answer the door in casual clothing, especially for deliveries. However, there's also a consideration of the other person's comfort. The pizza guy's reaction was discomfort, even taking a few steps back. That's a key point here.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want to be rude by keeping the delivery person waiting. That's a valid concern. But their wife's perspective is that it was \"shitty\" of them. So there's a conflict between the author's intention (to be polite by not making the person wait) and the outcome (making the delivery person uncomfortable).\n\nI should think about whether the author's action was respectful. While the intention was good, the result caused the delivery person to feel uneasy. It's important to respect others' comfort levels, even if the action is something the author has done before. The fact that the delivery person reacted physically suggests that it was a significant issue for them.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they thought delivery people have seen worse, but that's an assumption. Just because someone might have encountered various situations doesn't mean they're comfortable with all of them. It's about the individual's personal boundaries and how they feel in the moment.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but the action did cause discomfort. The question is whether that makes them wrong. Social etiquette often emphasizes consideration for others' feelings, so even if it's a common occurrence, it's better to be mindful of the other person's perspective. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (yes, they're in the wrong) because the action impacted someone else's comfort, even if unintentionally.\n"
