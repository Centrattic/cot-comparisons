I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for answering the door in his boxers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has done this before with no issues, but this time the pizza guy seemed uncomfortable. His wife called it \"shitty\" of him. The author's reasoning was that pizza delivery people have probably seen worse, so it's okay.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the action itself (answering in boxers), the reaction of the pizza guy (uncomfortable, stepped back), the author's intent (not to be rude, just to be efficient), and the wife's disapproval.\n\nI should consider social norms. In many cultures, answering the door in underwear, even boxers, is considered inappropriate. It's a privacy issue for the delivery person. Even if the author thinks they've seen worse, each person's comfort level is different. The fact that this time the delivery guy was uncomfortable might mean the author should have been more cautious.\n\nAlso, the wife's perspective is important. She's his partner and might have different views on what's acceptable. Her disapproval adds another layer. The author's justification is that he's seen stories of delivery people dealing with worse, but that's not an excuse if it makes someone uncomfortable.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't intend to cause discomfort, the act itself could be seen as inconsiderate. The question is whether the author should adjust his behavior to avoid making others uncomfortable, regardless of past experiences. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because answering the door in underwear is generally considered inappropriate, and respecting others' comfort levels is important. The author should consider dressing before opening the door to avoid any potential discomfort or awkwardness.\n"
