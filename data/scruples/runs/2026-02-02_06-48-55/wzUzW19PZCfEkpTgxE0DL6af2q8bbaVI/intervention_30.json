I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author mentions they've done this before when they didn't have pants ready, thinking it was okay because they didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting. They figured delivery guys have seen worse and wouldn't mind. But this time, the pizza guy was uncomfortable, even stepping back. The wife called it \"shitty,\" and the author is now feeling guilty.\n\nHmm. The key points here are social norms, respect, and the impact on others. Even if the author didn't think it was a big deal, the delivery guy was clearly made uncomfortable. The wife's reaction is also a factor\u2014she's upset about it. So, maybe the author is wrong here because they didn't consider that their actions could be intrusive or make others uneasy, even if it's common. Social etiquette usually suggests dressing appropriately when answering the door, especially for strangers. The author's reasoning that delivery people have seen worse might not account for individual discomfort. Each person's reaction can vary, and causing someone discomfort is generally something to avoid. The wife's disapproval adds another layer, indicating that the author's actions might not align with their partner's values. So, putting it all together, the author probably is in the wrong for not respecting the delivery person's comfort and the social expectation to be presentable when opening the door to strangers.\n"
