I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author of the AITA post) is in the wrong for answering the door in his boxers for the pizza guy. The situation is that he usually does this when he doesn't have pants ready and thinks it's okay because pizza delivery people might have seen worse. But this time, the delivery guy was clearly uncomfortable, even stepping back. His wife called it \"shitty,\" and now he's wondering if he should start dressing more properly.\n\nSo, the question is whether he was wrong. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not). \n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Generally, answering the door in underwear is considered inappropriate. Most people would expect to be dressed when opening the door to strangers. Even if delivery people are used to seeing various situations, that doesn't make it acceptable. The key here is the reaction of the delivery guy\u2014clear discomfort and stepping back. That indicates he was offended or uncomfortable, which suggests that the action crossed a line.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that he didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting and thought they've seen worse. However, just because someone might have seen worse doesn't mean it's okay to make them uncomfortable. The author's wife also disapproved, which adds another perspective. The wife's opinion might carry weight here as a close family member's view can be a good indicator of social norms.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intent was good\u2014he wanted to be polite and not make the delivery person wait. But intent doesn't necessarily override the impact. The result was that the delivery person was made uncomfortable, which is a negative outcome. The author feeling guilty afterward also shows he realized something was off.\n\nSo, even though the author might not have intended to offend, the act of opening the door in boxers is a breach of social etiquette. The delivery person's reaction supports that. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider the appropriateness of his attire for a situation involving a stranger. The correct answer would be A.\n"
