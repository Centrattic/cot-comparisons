I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for answering the door in his boxers for the pizza guy.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that they've done this before when they didn't have pants ready, not wanting to make the delivery person wait. Most times, there wasn't a reaction, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable and stepped back. The author felt guilty after their wife criticized them, and they're wondering if they should start dressing more appropriately.\n\nSo, the main points here are about social norms and respect for others' comfort. The author's intention was to be polite by not making the delivery person wait, which is understandable. However, the situation caused discomfort to the delivery person, which is a problem. \n\nIn many cultures, answering the door in just underwear might be seen as inappropriate, especially in front of strangers. Even if the author thought delivery people are used to seeing worse, each person's comfort level is different. The pizza guy's reaction shows that the author's actions made him uncomfortable. \n\nThe wife's criticism points out that it's inconsiderate. The key here is that while the author's intention was good (not making the person wait), they didn't consider the other person's feelings. There's a balance between politeness and respecting others' boundaries. \n\nSo, even if it's a common scenario, causing someone to feel uncomfortable is not acceptable. The author should consider dressing before answering the door, even if it means taking a couple more minutes. It's a small effort to avoid making someone else uncomfortable. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't respect the delivery person's comfort and privacy, even if unintentionally.\n"
