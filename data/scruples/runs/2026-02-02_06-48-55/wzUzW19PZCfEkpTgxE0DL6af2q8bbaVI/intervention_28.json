I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers for the pizza guy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and etiquette. Opening the door in underwear might be considered inappropriate because it's not a standard way to greet someone, especially a stranger. While the author mentions that they've done it before without issues, this time the delivery person was uncomfortable. That's a red flag.\n\nThe author's wife criticized him, which adds another layer. The wife's perspective is that it was \"shitty\" of him, which suggests that he might have acted inconsiderately. The key point is the discomfort of the delivery person. Even if the author thought the guy had seen worse, it's about the current situation. The delivery person's reaction shows that the author's actions were unwelcome.\n\nAlso, the author's justification is that they don't want to keep the delivery person waiting. However, there's a difference between being polite and being inconsiderate. A better approach would be to answer the door dressed appropriately or at least in something more formal than just boxers. Maybe the author could have taken a moment to put on pants quickly rather than risk making the delivery person uncomfortable.\n\nThe author's reasoning that pizza delivery people have seen worse might not be valid in this context. Just because someone is a delivery person doesn't mean they're comfortable with such situations. Respecting others' boundaries and comfort is important.\n\nSo, considering all these factors\u2014social norms, the delivery person's reaction, the wife's criticism, and the potential inconsideration\u2014the author's actions were inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
