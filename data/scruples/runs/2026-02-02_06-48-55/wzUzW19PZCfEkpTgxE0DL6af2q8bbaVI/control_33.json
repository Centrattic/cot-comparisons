I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The situation is that the pizza guy was uncomfortable and took a step back. The wife is upset, and the author is wondering if they should start dressing more before answering the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, it's common for people to answer the door in casual attire, even if it's just underwear. But there's also a cultural aspect. Some people might find it inappropriate, especially if it makes others uncomfortable. The key here is that the pizza guy was clearly uncomfortable, which the author noticed. The author's wife also called it \"shitty,\" indicating her disapproval.\n\nThen there's the perspective of the delivery person. The author mentions they thought delivery people have seen worse, but maybe that's not the case. Even if some have, being put in an uncomfortable situation isn't good. The author's intention was to be polite and not keep the person waiting, which is commendable, but the outcome was negative for the delivery person.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a social etiquette standpoint, while it's not unheard of, causing someone discomfort could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might not have intended to make the person uncomfortable, but the result is there. The wife's reaction adds another layer, suggesting that their household has different standards.\n\nI need to weigh intention versus impact. The author's intention was good, but the impact was negative. In many cases, even if unintentional, the effect matters. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering how their appearance might affect others. However, others might argue that it's a minor issue and that the delivery person should handle it professionally.\n\nBut since the pizza guy was uncomfortable, it's important to respect others' boundaries. The author's wife also disagrees, which could indicate that in their home, this is not acceptable. So the author might need to adjust their behavior to respect both the delivery person's comfort and their partner's feelings.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their action, while perhaps well-intentioned, caused discomfort to the delivery person and their partner disapproves, suggesting that adjusting their behavior would be considerate.\n"
