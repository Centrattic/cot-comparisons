I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who answered the door in their boxers is in the wrong. The situation is that the pizza guy seemed uncomfortable, and the wife criticized them for it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Generally, answering the door in underwear is considered inappropriate, even if it's common in some contexts. The key point here is the reaction of the delivery person. The person took a few steps back and was clearly uncomfortable. That suggests the action made them feel uneasy.\n\nThe author's rationale was that they didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting and thought that delivery workers have seen worse. But even if that's true, it's about respecting others' feelings and professional boundaries. The delivery person's discomfort matters, and the author should consider that their actions, while maybe not malicious, could be perceived as inappropriate or disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is a factor. She said it was shitty, which indicates a concern for social etiquette. The author might need to take that feedback seriously. Even if they didn't intend to cause discomfort, the impact on the delivery person is real. \n\nAnother angle: privacy vs. convenience. The author prioritized convenience (not making the delivery person wait) over their own privacy. But the balance should be in respecting both parties' comfort. Maybe a solution is to put on a robe or some clothes quickly, even if it takes a bit more time. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention wasn't to offend, the action did cause discomfort, and the appropriate response would be to adjust their behavior to avoid such situations in the future. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
