I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers. The scenario is that they answered the door in underwear a few times before because they didn't have pants on and didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting. This time, the pizza guy was uncomfortable and took steps back. The wife said it was shitty, and the author is wondering if they should dress more before answering the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and etiquette around answering the door in underwear. In many cultures, it's common for people to be in casual clothes at home, especially if they're expecting a delivery. However, others might find it inappropriate, depending on the context. The key points here are that the author did it without considering the other person's comfort, and in this instance, the pizza guy was visibly uncomfortable.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that pizza delivery people have likely seen worse, so they wouldn't mind. But the situation changed when the delivery person actually showed discomfort. The wife's reaction also adds weight to the argument that it was inconsiderate. The author's actions could be seen as respectful in some contexts but inconsiderate in others, especially since they caused discomfort to the delivery person.\n\nI need to weigh whether the author's actions were intentionally disrespectful or just an oversight. The author didn't have ill intent but might not have considered the other person's perspective. However, the fact that they continued to do it in the past despite potential awareness of others' possible discomfort could tip the balance towards being in the wrong.\n\nAlso, societal expectations often lean towards dressing appropriately if someone is in the vicinity of the door, even if it's just a delivery. While it's not a huge social faux pas, causing someone to feel uncomfortable by being in underwear might cross the line into being inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's a minor issue and that people should be more accommodating. But given that the delivery person was clearly uncomfortable, the author should take responsibility for that. The wife's disapproval also indicates that there's a social expectation to dress more appropriately for such interactions.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because they caused discomfort to another person by not dressing appropriately when answering the door, even if unintentionally. It's about respecting others' comfort levels and adjusting one's behavior accordingly.\n"
