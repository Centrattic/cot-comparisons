I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who answered the door in their boxers was in the wrong. The situation is that they answered the door for a pizza delivery guy in their underwear a few times before, but this time the guy was uncomfortable and stepped back. The wife criticized them for it. The person is unsure if they should start dressing more appropriately.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are about social norms and respect for others. The author's intention was to avoid keeping the delivery person waiting, which is a good intention. However, the delivery guy's reaction indicates that the author made him uncomfortable. The wife's disapproval adds another layer, as she points out the behavior was \"shitty,\" which is a negative judgment.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. Socially, answering the door in underwear is generally considered inappropriate. While delivery people might see various situations, that doesn't mean they are okay with all of them. The fact that the delivery guy was clearly uncomfortable and took steps back suggests that the author's actions were unprofessional or at least unconsidered. The author's argument that they've seen stories where delivery people have seen worse might not excuse the discomfort caused in this specific instance.\n\nThe author's own feelings of guilt after the incident also point to a recognition that perhaps they crossed a line. The wife's reaction reinforces the idea that this behavior is not acceptable. Even if the author didn't mean any harm, the impact on the delivery person matters. Respecting others' comfort and maintaining a level of professionalism, even in casual interactions, is important. Therefore, the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, were inconsiderate and should be adjusted.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions caused discomfort and disregarded social norms, even if their intent was to be polite.\n"
