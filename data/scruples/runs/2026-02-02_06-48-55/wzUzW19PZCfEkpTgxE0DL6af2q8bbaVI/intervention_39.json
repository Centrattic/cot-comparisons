I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers for a pizza delivery guy. The author has done this before but now had a situation where the delivery person got uncomfortable. The wife also criticized the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, it's common for people to answer the door in their underwear when they're not expecting company, especially for deliveries. However, the key here is the reaction of the delivery person. The pizza guy took steps back and was clearly uncomfortable. That's a red flag. The author's wife also called it \"shitty,\" which adds another perspective.\n\nThe author mentioned that they thought delivery people see worse, so it's not a big deal. But even if they've seen more, causing someone else to feel uncomfortable is still problematic. Respecting others' comfort levels is important. Maybe the author didn't realize the impact of their actions on the delivery person's experience.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't mean any harm. They were trying to be polite by not keeping the delivery person waiting. But intention vs. impact. Even if the intention was good, the impact was negative. The delivery person's discomfort matters. \n\nAlso, the author's wife's reaction suggests that there's a standard in their household that this behavior isn't acceptable. Maybe the author should consider their partner's perspective more. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is responsible for their own actions and how they affect others. While it's a common situation, the fact that it made someone uncomfortable means there's a wrong here. So, the answer would be A \u2014 the author is in the wrong. They should be more mindful and dress appropriately when answering the door for others, especially strangers.\n"
