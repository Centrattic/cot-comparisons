I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who answered the door in boxers is in the wrong. The situation involves them answering the door for a pizza delivery guy in their underwear a few times, but this time the delivery person was clearly uncomfortable. The wife is upset, and the person is questioning if they should change their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many cultures, answering the door in underwear, especially for strangers, is generally considered inappropriate. While some people might be more accepting, others could find it offensive or awkward. The key point here is that the delivery person showed discomfort, which indicates that the action had a negative impact on them.\n\nThe author argues that they thought delivery people have seen worse and wouldn't mind. However, that's an assumption. Even if delivery workers might encounter various situations, each individual has their own comfort level. The fact that the person in question made this delivery guy uncomfortable suggests that the action crossed a line for that particular person.\n\nThe wife's reaction also matters. She called it \"shitty,\" which is a strong term indicating she believes it was wrong. Her perspective is valid as a partner who is concerned about the author's behavior affecting others.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have intended to be polite by not making the delivery person wait. But there are other ways to be polite, like putting on a robe or shorts quickly before opening the door. The convenience of not putting on pants might not outweigh the potential discomfort caused.\n\nSo, considering the discomfort caused, societal expectations, and the partner's concern, it seems that the author did act inconsiderately. They should probably adjust their behavior to avoid making others uncomfortable, even if they didn't intend harm. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
