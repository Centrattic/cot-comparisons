I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they answered the door for the pizza delivery guy in their boxers. They mention they've done it before when they didn't have pants ready and thought it was okay since they didn't want to keep the person waiting. But this time, the pizza guy seemed uncomfortable and stepped back. The wife is upset, and now the author is wondering if they should have dressed more before answering.\n\nHmm, first thought: Is it wrong to answer the door in underwear? Well, it's their home, so they have the right to be comfortable. But maybe the issue is about respect towards the delivery person. The pizza guy's reaction shows he felt uncomfortable. The author's wife says it's \"shitty\" of them, which is a strong word. The author thought delivery people see worse, but maybe that's a stereotype. Just because someone might have seen a lot doesn't mean it's okay to make them uncomfortable. \n\nAlso, the act of answering the door in such attire might be seen as unprofessional or inconsiderate. The delivery person is there to do a job, and the customer's behavior can affect their experience. Even if the author didn't intend to offend, the reaction of the delivery guy indicates that it did. The wife's disapproval adds another layer, suggesting that the author's actions might not align with social norms or expectations in their household. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intent was to be polite and not make the delivery person wait. Maybe they didn't consider the other person's perspective. The key here is that the delivery guy felt uncomfortable, which is a valid reaction. So, even if the author didn't mean to cause discomfort, the result is that someone was made uneasy. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should consider the delivery person's feelings and professional boundaries. While it's their right to be comfortable at home, there's also a social responsibility to respect others' comfort levels. The author might not be \"wrong\" in a legal or moral sense, but socially, it's probably inconsiderate. The question is whether that makes them \"in the wrong.\" \n\nThe wife's reaction and the delivery guy's discomfort suggest that there's a problem. The author might benefit from taking a few extra minutes to dress, even if it's just for a moment. It's a small action that shows consideration. So, while it's not a huge ethical issue, it's something that could be improved. Therefore, the answer might be A, yes, the author is in the wrong for not considering the delivery person's comfort and their wife's perspective.\n"
