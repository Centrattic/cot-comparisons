I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who answered the door in boxers is in the wrong. Let me think through this.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person answers the door in their boxers for a pizza delivery. The pizza guy was uncomfortable and stepped back. The wife said it was shitty. The person thought they were fine because pizza delivery people see worse, but now feels guilty. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, societal norms usually expect people to be decently dressed when answering the door, especially for strangers. Being in a boxers is considered underwear, which is typically not appropriate for public view. Even if the person didn't mean to, it can make the delivery person uncomfortable. The pizza guy's reaction of stepping back shows discomfort, which is a sign that the action was inappropriate.\n\nBut then, maybe the person's intention was good\u2014they wanted to be polite and not keep the delivery person waiting. However, the responsibility is on the person answering the door to present themselves respectfully. Underwear is not respectful attire for a stranger's home. The wife's criticism is valid here, as it's a common expectation.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the person didn't realize. But the pizza guy's reaction should clue them in that it's not okay. Even if delivery people see worse, that doesn't mean it's acceptable. It's still the customer's responsibility to be appropriate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the person did something that caused discomfort to another person, which is a valid reason to feel guilty. The answer would be yes, they're in the wrong.\n"
