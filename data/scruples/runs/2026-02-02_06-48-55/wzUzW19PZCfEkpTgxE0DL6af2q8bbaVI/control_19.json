I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The situation is that the author did this a few times before, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable and stepped back. The wife called it \"shitty\" of him, and the author is wondering if he should start dressing more properly when answering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, answering the door in underwear is considered immodest or inappropriate, especially for someone outside the household. Even if the author thought that delivery people have seen worse, that's an assumption. The key here is the reaction of the pizza guy\u2014he was clearly uncomfortable. The author's wife also disapproved, which adds to the idea that it's not seen as acceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to not make the delivery person wait, which is polite. But the problem is that the author didn't consider the other person's comfort. The main issue is that the author's actions made someone else uncomfortable, even if unintentionally. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Being in the wrong would mean that their action was socially inappropriate and caused discomfort. The fact that the pizza guy physically stepped back shows a negative reaction. The wife's disapproval reinforces that the action was inappropriate. Even if the author thought it's normal, the reaction of the other person matters. So, the answer is likely A, yes, the author is in the wrong because their action caused discomfort and is considered immodest in many contexts.\n"
