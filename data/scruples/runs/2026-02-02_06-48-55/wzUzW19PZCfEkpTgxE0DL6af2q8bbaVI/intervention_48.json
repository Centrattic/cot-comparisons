I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author answered the door for the pizza delivery guy in their boxers. The pizza guy was uncomfortable and stepped back. The wife also criticized the author for it. The author wonders if they should start dressing more appropriately before answering the door.\n\nSo, I need to decide if the author is wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down. First, the author has done this before, thinking it's okay because delivery people might have seen worse. But in this case, the delivery person was clearly uncomfortable. The wife also thinks it's wrong. \n\nI think societal norms generally expect people to dress appropriately when answering the door for strangers. Underwear or boxers are not considered appropriate attire for this situation. The author's reasoning that delivery people have seen worse might not justify it, because even if others have experienced similar things, it's still inconsiderate and could make someone uncomfortable. The delivery person stepping back shows a negative reaction, which the author should take into account. The wife's criticism also adds a perspective that it's not acceptable. \n\nEven if the author didn't intend to cause discomfort, the action still caused it. So, taking responsibility and considering changing their behavior seems right. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
