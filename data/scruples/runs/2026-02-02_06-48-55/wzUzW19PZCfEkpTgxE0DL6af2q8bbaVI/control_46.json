I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers. The situation is that they did this a few times before, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable. The wife called it shitty, and the author is wondering if they should start dressing more before answering the door.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The person is answering the door in underwear because they don't have pants ready and don't want to make the delivery person wait. They thought it was okay because they've heard stories that delivery people have seen worse. But now they're feeling guilty after the pizza guy reacted negatively.\n\nSo, the main question is about social norms and respect. Is it wrong to answer the door in underwear? In many cultures, it's considered inappropriate to answer the door in just underwear, especially for strangers. Even if delivery people might have seen worse, it's still a matter of common courtesy. The person's wife is upset, which adds another layer. The author's justification is that they wanted to be polite by not keeping the delivery person waiting, but that might not be a valid excuse if it makes the delivery person uncomfortable.\n\nThe key points here are respect for others' comfort and maintaining personal boundaries. While it's understandable that someone might not want to keep a delivery person waiting, it's equally important to consider the other person's feelings and the social norms around dressing appropriately when opening the door. The fact that the delivery person physically stepped back shows they were clearly uncomfortable, which the author then felt guilty about. The wife's reaction also indicates that this behavior is not socially acceptable in their household.\n\nSo, the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because, despite their intentions, the action was disrespectful and made the delivery person uncomfortable. The author should consider dressing more appropriately even if it means taking a moment to put on pants. It's a balance between politeness and respecting others' comfort.\n"
