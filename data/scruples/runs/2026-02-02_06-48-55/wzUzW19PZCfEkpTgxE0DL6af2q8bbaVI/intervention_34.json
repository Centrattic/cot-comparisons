I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers for the pizza guy. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author usually answers the door in underwear when they don't have pants on, thinking it's okay since delivery people might have seen worse. However, this time the pizza guy was clearly uncomfortable, stepping back. The wife also criticized the author. The author is now questioning if they should dress more appropriately.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong, but they want my opinion. Let's break it down. The key points here are social norms, respect for others' comfort, and whether the author's actions were considerate.\n\nIn many cultures, answering the door in underwear is generally acceptable for a delivery person you don't know, especially if it's brief and you're just signing for the package. However, the pizza guy's reaction suggests it made him uncomfortable. The author might not have realized the impact of their actions. \n\nBut wait, the author's intention was to be polite by not making the delivery person wait. There's a balance between politeness and respecting others' boundaries. The author's usual approach was not causing issues before, but in this case, it did. The wife's reaction adds another perspective\u2014maybe she thinks it's unprofessional or inappropriate regardless of the delivery person's past experiences.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on intent versus impact. The author didn't intend to offend, but the impact on the delivery person was negative. Social norms suggest that while it's common to answer in underwear, if it makes someone uncomfortable, the person opening the door should adjust their behavior.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong because they have no control over how the delivery person reacts. But the fact that the pizza guy was visibly uncomfortable and the wife disapproves might tip the balance towards the author being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering that the author's action caused discomfort, even if unintentionally, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because they should be mindful of others' feelings and adjust their behavior to avoid discomfort.\n"
