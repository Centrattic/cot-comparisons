I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author answered the door in their boxers for a pizza delivery person. The pizza guy was uncomfortable, and the author's wife told them it was shitty to do so. The author is wondering if they should start dressing more appropriately before answering the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Generally, people expect a certain level of modesty and respect when answering the door, especially for strangers. While some might be used to seeing various situations (as the author mentions hearing stories from delivery people), it's still considerate to avoid making others uncomfortable. The key here is that the pizza guy was clearly uncomfortable, which indicates that the author's actions had a negative impact on the other person.\n\nThe author's reasoning was that they didn't want to keep the delivery person waiting, but there are alternatives. For example, they could have put on a robe or a shirt quickly, or even asked the delivery person to wait a moment while they dressed. The author's wife's reaction also suggests that this behavior isn't socially acceptable in their household. \n\nEven though the author may not have intended to be rude, the result was that someone else felt uncomfortable. Intention isn't the only factor here; the effect on the other person matters too. The author's assumption that delivery people see worse might not account for individual differences in what people find acceptable. \n\nSo, considering the discomfort caused and the availability of alternatives, it seems the author did act inconsiderately. Therefore, they might be in the wrong.\n"
