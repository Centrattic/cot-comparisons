I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers. The author mentions they've done this before, thinking it's okay since they've heard delivery people see worse. But this time, the pizza guy was uncomfortable and even stepped back. The wife is upset, and the author is feeling guilty now.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider social norms and what's considered appropriate when answering the door. Most people would agree that being partially dressed in front of strangers isn't the norm. Even if the delivery person is used to seeing various situations, the fact that this person was visibly uncomfortable suggests that the author's actions were inappropriate. The key here is that the author's behavior made another person uncomfortable, which is a valid reason to reconsider their actions.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is important. She called it \"shitty,\" meaning she disapproves. While that's subjective, her perspective is part of the household dynamics. The author might want to respect her feelings and avoid future issues. \n\nThere's an argument that the author is being considerate by not making the delivery person wait, but that's balancing against the other person's comfort. The solution here would be to dress even if it takes a bit longer. It's a small effort for a big impact on others' comfort. \n\nI think the answer is A\u2014yes, the author is in the wrong. They should consider others' feelings and adjust their behavior to be more respectful.\n"
