I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about answering the door in boxers for a pizza delivery guy. The writer did this before without issues, but this time the delivery person was uncomfortable. The wife said it was \"shitty\" of him to do that. The writer is now questioning if he should start dressing more when answering the door.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author made a mistake. The key points here are about social norms, respect for others, and the delivery person's comfort. The author's reasoning was that delivery people see worse, so it's not a big deal. But in this case, the delivery guy was clearly uncomfortable, which caused the author to feel guilty.\n\nFrom a social etiquette standpoint, answering the door in underwear is generally considered inappropriate, even if it's common. It's about respecting the other person's comfort level. The author's wife also disapproves, which adds a personal relationship dynamic. The fact that the delivery person reacted by stepping back shows that it was indeed a problem for them, even if others might not have reacted the same way.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to cause discomfort, the action did affect the delivery person. The author is responsible for considering others' feelings. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
