I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers. The situation is that they answered the door for a pizza delivery guy in their underwear, which has happened before. This time, the pizza guy was uncomfortable and stepped back. The wife is upset, and the person is wondering if they should start dressing more when answering the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Generally, answering the door in underwear isn't typical in public settings. While it might be common in some households if you're expecting someone, it's still considered impolite or inappropriate in many cultures. The key points here are the reaction of the pizza guy and the wife's disapproval.\n\nThe author mentions that the pizza guy was clearly uncomfortable, even stepping back. That's a strong indicator that their actions were unwelcome. Even if the author thought delivery people see worse, it's still not acceptable to make someone uncomfortable. The person's own wife is upset, which adds another layer of social expectation within the household. The wife's disapproval suggests that the author's actions are conflicting with household norms.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of respect. Both the delivery person and the spouse deserve to be treated with respect. Showing up in underwear might be seen as disrespectful, especially since the delivery person is a professional providing a service. There's also the aspect of privacy and modesty. The author's reasoning that they didn't want to make the delivery person wait might be well-intentioned, but the solution (answering in underwear) isn't the best approach. There are other ways to handle the situation, like putting on a robe or at least some clothing before opening the door.\n\nThe author's previous actions show that this isn't an isolated incident. They've done it before without noticing reactions, but this time it was more pronounced. It's possible that previous delivery people didn't react, but that doesn't mean it's okay. Each person might have different thresholds for discomfort, so it's better to avoid the situation altogether.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is putting themselves in a position where they might inadvertently make others uncomfortable. Even if they didn't intend to, the effect is there. The guilt they felt after suggests they recognized the issue, which is a good sign, but the question is whether they were wrong to do it in the first place.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions were indeed inappropriate. They should take steps to dress more appropriately when answering the door for strangers, regardless of the reason. Respecting others' comfort and privacy is important, and the author's actions, while perhaps born out of kindness to not keep the delivery person waiting, ended up causing discomfort. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
