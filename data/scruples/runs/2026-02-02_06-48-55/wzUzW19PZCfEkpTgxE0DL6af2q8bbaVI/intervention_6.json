I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is that the author answered the door for a pizza delivery in their boxers. They've done this before, but this time the delivery person was uncomfortable. The author feels guilty now and their wife is upset. The question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, answering the door in underwear or just a towel is common, especially at home. People are in all states of dress when answering the door unexpectedly. However, the key point here is the reaction of the pizza guy. He was clearly uncomfortable, even stepped back. That's a red flag. The author thought delivery people have seen worse, but maybe that's not the case. Just because someone works in delivery doesn't mean they're prepared for all situations. There's a difference between being used to seeing people in casual clothes versus being exposed to something they find uncomfortable.\n\nThe wife's reaction is also important. She called it \"shitty,\" which indicates that she thinks it's disrespectful or inconsiderate. The author's initial attitude was casual, assuming it's okay because they thought delivery people have seen worse. But maybe that's a generalization. Not everyone is comfortable with that scenario, and the delivery person's reaction shows that it was an issue for him.\n\nAnother angle: respect and consideration. Even if the author didn't have pants on, putting on a robe or something more covering might have been a better choice. The delivery person's discomfort suggests that the author didn't consider how their appearance might affect the other person. It's about being mindful of others' feelings and boundaries.\n\nBut then again, the author was trying to be polite by not making the delivery person wait. There's a balance between being courteous and maintaining appropriate boundaries. Maybe the author didn't realize that putting on a robe or pants quickly would have been better than being in a state that made someone uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, cultural norms vary. In some cultures, it's more accepted to be in underwear at home and answer the door. But in others, it's considered inappropriate. However, the key here is the reaction of the delivery person. If someone is uncomfortable, it's a sign that the action crossed a line for them.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to be polite, the action led to discomfort for the delivery person. The author didn't consider the other person's feelings and made an assumption that might not hold true. The wife's criticism is valid because it's about respecting others' boundaries. So, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
