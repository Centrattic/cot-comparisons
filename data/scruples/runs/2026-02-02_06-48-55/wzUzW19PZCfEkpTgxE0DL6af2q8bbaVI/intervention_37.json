I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers for the pizza delivery guy. The author mentions that they've done this before, thinking that pizza guys have seen worse and wouldn't mind, but this time the delivery person was uncomfortable. Their wife also criticized them for it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and expectations. Opening the door in underwear is generally considered inappropriate, especially when someone is delivering something for you. It's a public interaction, and even though the delivery person might be accustomed to seeing various situations, it's still respectful to be dressed appropriately when receiving a delivery. The author's action could be seen as careless about the delivery person's comfort and boundaries.\n\nThe pizza guy's reaction\u2014taking steps back and being uncomfortable\u2014indicates that this situation made him uneasy. Even if the author didn't intend to offend, the impact on the other person matters. The author's wife's disapproval also suggests that there's a perspective that this is inconsiderate. The argument that delivery people \"have seen worse\" might be a way to justify the behavior, but that doesn't make it acceptable. Everyone has a threshold, and making someone uncomfortable is not acceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have intended harm and might have thought it was a minor thing. However, the responsibility isn't just about intent but also about respecting others' feelings and maintaining a professional boundary. The author could have taken a few extra minutes to put on pants, which would have been a small effort to avoid making someone uncomfortable. Since the author is aware now that their action caused discomfort, changing the behavior moving forward is the right step.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's action, while perhaps not malicious, does cross into being inconsiderate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering the delivery person's comfort and acting appropriately in a professional setting.\n"
