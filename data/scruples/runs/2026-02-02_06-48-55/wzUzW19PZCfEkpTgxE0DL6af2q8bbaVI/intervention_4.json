I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for answering the door in their boxers. The situation involves opening the door in underwear for a pizza delivery person, which made the guy uncomfortable. The wife called it \"shitty,\" and the person is now questioning their actions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Generally, answering the door in just boxers or underwear is considered inappropriate, especially with strangers. People might feel embarrassed or uncomfortable, which happened here. The pizza guy took steps back, indicating he felt awkward or maybe even threatened. \n\nThe author's reasoning was that delivery people see worse, but that doesn't make it okay. Just because someone might be desensitized to various situations doesn't mean the action isn't respectful. There's a difference between what people \"see worse\" and what is respectful. The wife's reaction also suggests that there's a social expectation to dress appropriately when opening the door for someone else, especially a service worker.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for making others uncomfortable. Even if the author didn't intend to, the result was that the pizza guy was uncomfortable. That guilt is a valid point. The author might not have considered the other person's feelings, which is a key part of being respectful.\n\nHowever, there's a debate about whether it's the person's fault if they didn't realize it was an issue. But social norms usually dictate that one should dress appropriately for visitors, regardless of their own comfort. The fact that the author did it multiple times without issue before might have led them to dismiss the significance, but the wife's disapproval and the pizza guy's reaction indicate that it's actually problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they didn't consider the other person's comfort and breached a social norm. Answering A makes sense here.\n"
