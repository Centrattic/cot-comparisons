I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who answered the door in their boxers was in the wrong. The situation is that the pizza guy seemed uncomfortable, and the person's wife called it \"shitty\" of them. The person wonders if they should start dressing more before answering the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many places, people might expect that when answering the door for delivery, you should be dressed appropriately. While it's common for people to be in casual attire at home, showing up in just boxers might be seen as inappropriate, especially if it makes the delivery person uncomfortable. \n\nThe key points here are the reaction of the pizza guy and the wife's opinion. The person mentions that the pizza guy took steps back and was clearly uncomfortable. Even if they thought delivery people have seen worse, causing someone else discomfort is a valid concern. The wife's criticism adds another layer, suggesting that maybe the person didn't consider social etiquette properly.\n\nHowever, there's also the argument that it's a quick transaction and not a big deal. But the discomfort caused indicates that it's not just about what the person thinks but how their actions affect others. The question is whether being in boxers is unprofessional or inconsiderate. \n\nIn many cultures, showing up in just underwear at the door could be seen as indecent exposure, even if briefly. It's about respecting others' comfort levels. Since the delivery person was uncomfortable, that suggests the person might have been in the wrong by not taking a moment to dress appropriately, even if it's just boxers. \n\nSo, considering the discomfort caused and societal expectations, the answer might lean towards A (they're in the wrong). But maybe there's a balance. However, the consensus in similar situations often sides with being respectful and dressing appropriately when expecting visitors, even if they're just delivering something. So I think the answer is A.\n"
