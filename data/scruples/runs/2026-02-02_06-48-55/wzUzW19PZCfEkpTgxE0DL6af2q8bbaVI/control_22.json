I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers to a pizza delivery guy. The situation is that the pizza guy was uncomfortable and stepped back, and the author's wife said it was shitty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. In many places, it's common for people to answer the door in casual attire, especially if they're home alone and it's late. But then again, pizza delivery workers might expect some level of modesty. The author mentioned they've done this before without issues, but this time the guy was clearly uncomfortable. That's a key point. \n\nThe author's wife is critical, which adds to the situation. Maybe the wife's perspective is that even if the delivery person didn't mind before, it's still inconsiderate. The author's reasoning was that delivery people have seen worse, but maybe that's a flawed assumption. Just because someone might have seen worse doesn't mean they appreciate it each time. \n\nAlso, the author felt guilty after, which suggests they might have some internal conflict. The question is whether this action was wrong. From a social standpoint, while it's not illegal, it's a matter of respect and consideration. If the action made the delivery person uncomfortable, then it's a social faux pas. \n\nSo, considering the discomfort caused and the wife's criticism, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. But others might say it's a minor issue. However, since the person was clearly affected, it's probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
