I've never really noticed much of a reaction before, but tonight the pizza guy was clearly very uncomfortable, even physically taking a couple steps back when I opened the door. I tried to just sign the receipt and take the pizza quickly so he could leave, but I started feeling guilty. When I told my wife, she basically said it was shitty of me answer the door like that. \n\nI've never really thought twice about it, and have seen enough stories from pizza delivery people that I just figured they've all seen much worse, so they wouldn't mind, but should I start taking the time to dress more?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for answering the door in boxers when they were delivering pizza.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person answers the door in boxers a few times before, but this time the pizza guy was uncomfortable and stepped back. The wife called it \"shitty\" of them. The author is considering if they should dress more properly despite thinking delivery people have seen worse.\n\nSo, do I think the author is in the wrong? Well, the key points here are about social norms and respect. While the author might have thought it's okay, the pizza guy's reaction shows he was uncomfortable. It's important to consider others' feelings and comfort levels. Even if the author is in their home, answering the door in just underwear might be considered inappropriate by some, especially since it's not just strangers but service workers who come to the home. The wife's reaction also indicates that it's not socially acceptable. The author's intention was to be polite, but they might have overlooked the potential discomfort they caused. So, maybe the author should have been more considerate and dressed appropriately to avoid making the delivery person feel uneasy. I think the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
