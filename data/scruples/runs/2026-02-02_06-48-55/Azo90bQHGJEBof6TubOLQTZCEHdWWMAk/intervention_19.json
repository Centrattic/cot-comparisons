Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. First, I need to consider the context and the key points mentioned.\n\nThe girlfriend has PCOS and has always said she can't get pregnant. The author is 22, and the girlfriend is 23. They've been dating since August. The girlfriend was pregnant, but she delayed the abortion process by not getting a test quickly or going to the doctor on time. The author is concerned about their current life situations\u2014work stress, financial support for the girlfriend who's on welfare, and her mental health. The girlfriend also mentioned a past pregnancy ten years ago, which the author found out later. The author feels lied to because the girlfriend never confirmed that a doctor said she couldn't get pregnant again, and now she's hesitating about the abortion, leading to a more complex procedure.\n\nSo, the main issues here are the girlfriend's honesty and the author's pressure for an abortion. The author might feel betrayed by her past pregnancy and the lack of medical confirmation about her fertility. However, the girlfriend has her own reasons for hesitating, which could include fear, emotional conflict, or other personal issues. The author's argument is based on their current inability to support a child, but the girlfriend's delay might indicate internal conflict about proceeding with the abortion.\n\nIn terms of ethics, a pregnancy decision is typically considered a personal and medical choice, often a woman's right. The author is pressuring her to make a decision, which could be seen as respecting her autonomy if he's against parenthood right now. But if the girlfriend is unresponsive or making her own decisions, the author's insistence might be overstepping, especially if he's not allowing her to take time to process.\n\nThe girlfriend's use of vulgar language about the abortion and the author's frustration with her delay suggest communication issues. The author might be in the wrong if he's not giving her space to make her own decision, even if he disagrees. Also, the fact that she previously got pregnant and is now dealing with this might show that her fertility isn't as stable as she claimed, which the author found out later. But the author's role in pressuring her for an abortion could be problematic if it's not fully respecting her autonomy.\n\nDenmark's laws on abortion allow for it up to 12 weeks, but the method changes after 8. The girlfriend's delay led to a more invasive procedure, which the author is criticizing. However, the girlfriend's hesitation could be valid, perhaps due to anxiety or needing more information. The author's frustration might be justified by the delayed process, but the question is whether pressuring her for an abortion is wrong.\n\nThe key point is whether the author is respecting the girlfriend's right to make her own decision. Even if he's against having a child now, the final decision should be hers. But the girlfriend's dishonesty about her fertility and past pregnancy might be a separate issue where she's in the wrong. The author's actions could be a mix of justified concern and overstepping in the decision-making process. The answer likely hinges on whether the author is enforcing his own wishes without considering her autonomy, which would make him in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend is being dishonest and delaying the process, that's her fault. The original question is about the author's actions, so if he's pressuring her to abort when she's already hesitant, that could be seen as wrong. But if he's sharing his concerns and she's making the choice, maybe not. The line between shared decision-making and coercion is important here.\n"
