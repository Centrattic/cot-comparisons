Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (who is a guy in a relationship with his girlfriend) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation involves several factors: the girlfriend has PCOS and previously claimed she couldn't get pregnant, but ended up pregnant. She delayed getting medical attention, leading to a surgical abortion instead of a chemical one. She also mentioned a past pregnancy she didn't disclose earlier. The author argues that she used his trust by lying about her fertility and now is hesitating in the abortion process.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks, so the girlfriend making the decision is within her rights. The author is pressuring her to abort, which might be seen as controlling, especially since he's not the one carrying the pregnancy. Even though they're in a relationship, the ultimate decision about the pregnancy should be hers. The fact that she delayed the process could be due to her own hesitations or emotional reasons. The author's concern about their future and financial stability is valid, but he's not the one facing the physical and emotional consequences of the pregnancy.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior\u2014like lying about her past pregnancy and delaying the procedure\u2014might make the author feel betrayed. However, that doesn't justify him pressuring her to have an abortion. The author's use of her hesitation as a reason to feel less sympathy might be self-justification. Ethically, supporting a partner's decision without coercion is important. The author's main issue is that he wants her to abort, but if she's now uncertain and the procedure is taking longer due to her delays, he's using that to justify his stance. However, the decision ultimately rests with the woman, and his insistence might be seen as overstepping, especially without a formal medical statement on her fertility.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the girlfriend's mental health and welfare support. While that's part of their situation, it's not a reason to force an abortion. The key point is that the decision to terminate a pregnancy is hers, not his. Even if he's worried about their future, he can't make that decision for her. His arguments about her delays and her past might be rationalizations to avoid taking responsibility for his role in the situation. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid concerns about their future and her past behavior, the act of telling her to get an abortion when she's the one carrying the pregnancy is ethically problematic. The decision should be hers, and pressuring her in this way could be seen as controlling or dismissive of her autonomy.\n"
