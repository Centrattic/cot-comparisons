Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23, and they're in Europe, probably Denmark. They've been dating since August. The girl told him early on that she couldn't get pregnant because she has PCOS and that if she did get pregnant, she'd just get an abortion. Now they found out she's pregnant, and it's been a week or two. The law in Denmark is that abortion is surgical between 8-12 weeks and chemical before 8 weeks. She was told she's 8 weeks pregnant.\n\nShe delayed getting a test and then a doctor's appointment. She had a chance to get an immediate appointment but didn't. The guy lists reasons why he thinks they can't have a kid now\u2014his work schedule, her living on welfare, her mental health, etc. She keeps saying having a baby isn't stressful, but he argues it is. She uses vulgar language about abortion, like \"kill the baby.\" She also revealed she was pregnant 10 years ago, which the guy sees as a red flag because she claimed she couldn't get pregnant, and PCOS came after that. No doctor confirmed she can't get pregnant.\n\nAt the gynecologist, she was asked if she wanted the abortion, and she said no. Instead of rescheduling, she waited to talk to him. He feels she misused his trust by lying about her fertility and hiding her past pregnancy. He's upset that her delays forced her into the surgical option, which has a risk of infertility. He says he's not okay with her not moving quickly and doesn't feel bad for her if she had acted faster.\n\nThe guy is asking if he's the a**hole for telling her to get an abortion.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. The guy is concerned about their future and the stress of having a child now. He's in a position where he can't provide stability. The girl, on the other hand, has her own issues\u2014PCOS, mental health, living on welfare. But she delayed the process, which led to a more invasive procedure. She also lied about not being able to get pregnant and hid her past pregnancy.\n\nBut here's the thing: the woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including the choice to have an abortion. The guy is pressuring her to have an abortion, which is her personal decision. Even if he's against the pregnancy, he's not the one carrying it. The girl delayed the procedure, possibly because she was conflicted, but she's the one who had the final decision. The guy's main issue is that she was dishonest about her fertility history and her delays. However, her honesty might have been a way to cope with her own situation, especially if she felt pressured or uncertain.\n\nThe guy's arguments are about not being ready for a child and the stress involved, which are valid concerns. But he's essentially dictating her medical decisions, which can be problematic. The girl's autonomy is key here. Even if she delayed, the decision to abort is hers. The guy's frustration is understandable, but he's in a position where he's trying to control her reproductive choices, which is a big red flag.\n\nSo, considering all that, the guy is in the wrong because he's pressuring her to have an abortion and making her decisions for her, especially in a situation where her autonomy is paramount. His concerns about their future are valid, but he shouldn't be the one deciding her medical choices. The girl's delays and dishonesty don't justify his actions. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
