Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a couple dealing with an unexpected pregnancy. The guy is asking if he's at fault for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend had mentioned before they started dating that she couldn't get pregnant due to PCOS and that she'd get an abortion if she ever did. Now that she is pregnant, she's hesitating in the process, leading to a surgical abortion instead of a chemical one. The guy is frustrated because she's been slow, and he's worried about their future and the stress of having a child. He also found out she was pregnant before, which he sees as a red flag.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Why? Maybe because the guy is pressuring her to abort, or because he's not considering her feelings? But the girlfriend is the one who delayed the process and then changed her mind. The guy is reacting to her decisions, but does that make him wrong?\n\nIn terms of ethics, the right to make decisions about one's own body is a big factor. The girl has the right to choose, but the guy is involved in the decision-making. However, in most cases, the woman has the final say. The guy might be overstepping by insisting on the abortion, especially if she's now uncertain. But given the context, he might feel it's necessary for both of their well-being.\n\nAlso, the girl's actions\u2014like hiding her past pregnancy and delaying the process\u2014could contribute to his frustration. He might feel she misrepresented her fertility, which is a valid concern. But does that justify pressuring her to abort? Or is he just reacting to her poor decisions?\n\nAnother angle: the guy is being honest about his inability to handle parenthood right now. That's not inherently wrong. The problem might be in how he's handling the situation. If he's using emotional manipulation or not respecting her autonomy, that's an issue. But if he's clearly stating his reasons and boundaries, he's within his rights.\n\nIn many cultures, the woman has the ultimate decision on pregnancy. So even if the guy is against it, he can't force her to abort. However, in this case, the girl initially wanted the abortion but is now hesitant. His response might be a reaction to her change of heart, which complicates things. \n\nI should also consider the legal aspect in Denmark. The law allows for abortion up to 12 weeks, which she's at. She's the one who needs to make the decision, but the guy's input is part of their relationship dynamics. However, he can't override her choice. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's pressuring her or trying to control her decision, yes. But if he's expressing his concerns and boundaries honestly, maybe not. The key is whether he's respecting her autonomy. The text shows he's told her he doesn't want a child yet and she's the one who delayed the process. He's not forcing her; he's pointing out the consequences of her actions. \n\nOn the other hand, the way he phrases things\u2014like saying he doesn't feel bad for her because she was slow\u2014might be insensitive. But in terms of being wrong for suggesting an abortion, he's within his rights to have that opinion. The real issue might be how they're communicating and handling the situation together, but not necessarily his stance on the abortion itself.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's expressing his views and concerns, and the woman is making the final decisions. However, there are elements of their communication that could be improved. But based on the information, he's not the one who's in the wrong.\n"
