Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the question on Reddit) is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 22, his girlfriend (GF) is 23. They live in Europe, specifically Denmark. They've been dating since August. The GF has PCOS and was told she might not be able to get pregnant. She also mentioned that if she did get pregnant, she would get an abortion. Now she's pregnant, and they found out two weeks ago. The author is pressuring her to get an abortion, but she's been hesitant and slow in the process. She ended up needing a surgical abortion because of the delay, and there's a risk she might not be able to get pregnant again. The author feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her past pregnancy and PCOS diagnosis. He's not ready for a kid, and they both agree they can't afford to have a child now.\n\nSo the question is: Is the author in the wrong for telling his GF to get an abortion?\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. In many places, including Denmark, both partners have a say in reproductive decisions, but ultimately, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is up to the woman. The author is pressuring her, which could be seen as controlling. However, the GF has her own reasons for hesitating, like her mental health and financial situation. She's also been inconsistent in her actions\u2014saying she would get an abortion but then delaying the process. The author might feel frustrated because he's not ready for a child and is worried about their future. But pressuring her to terminate could be seen as respecting her autonomy or not? \n\nWait, the author is telling her what to do, which might not be the right approach. Even if both partners are not ready, the decision is hers. So if he's pressuring her, maybe he's in the wrong. Also, she mentioned that she was hesitant and had her own reasons for delaying, maybe due to fear of the surgical procedure or other emotional factors. The author's use of phrases like \"I don't feel bad for her\" because she delayed might indicate a lack of empathy. \n\nOn the other hand, the GF might be manipulating the situation by delaying and then being upset about the need for surgery. But the author is reacting to her actions. The key points here are mutual responsibility and autonomy. The author isn't in the wrong if he's expressing his own stance, but pressuring her to make the decision against her will could be problematic. However, considering their agreement that they can't have a kid right now, maybe his stance is valid. But the way he's approaching it, without considering her feelings and the medical risks, might be where the issue lies. \n\nAlso, she lied about her ability to conceive and had a past pregnancy, which the author found out later. That might have contributed to his frustration. However, the main question is about him telling her to get an abortion. In many ethical discussions, a person's right to control their own body is paramount. So even if the author is not ready for a child, he can't force her to terminate. But the question is whether he is in the wrong for suggesting it. \n\nIn some contexts, suggesting an abortion when both partners are not ready could be seen as a shared decision, but if he's pressuring her, it's a problem. The fact that she's hesitant and he's pressuring might make him at fault. However, the situation is complex with both parties having valid concerns. \n\nI think the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's expressing his own stance based on their shared inability to handle a child, but the way he's handling the situation could be improved. However, the key is whether he's in the wrong for making the suggestion. Since he's not making her do it but is advising her, maybe he's not wrong. But if he's pressuring her, then maybe he is. The Reddit post might be seeking validation for his frustration. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the GF has autonomy over her body, maybe the author shouldn't have a say in the matter. But culturally, in relationships, partners often discuss these decisions. The problem arises when one partner pressures the other. So if the author is pressuring her, he might be in the wrong. However, the GF's own actions (delaying, not being honest) contribute to the situation. \n\nOverall, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because he's sharing his own stance, but there's room for empathy and understanding on both sides. The main issue is whether he's respecting her autonomy. Since he's not forcing her but expressing his opinion, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the way he's treating her and the lack of support might be problematic. But the question specifically asks if he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion, not for being harsh. Given the complexities, I think the answer is B.\n"
