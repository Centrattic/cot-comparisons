Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they mention that the girlfriend has PCOS and was told she can't get pregnant. But it turns out she did get pregnant, and she had a previous pregnancy around 10 years ago. The writer finds out she might have been hiding that. The woman is now pregnant and considering an abortion, but she's been slow in the process, leading to a surgical option now. She also uses vulgar language about the abortion, like \"kill the baby,\" which the writer finds disturbing. \n\nThe writer is arguing that they don't want a child yet due to work and financial reasons, and the girlfriend's mental health and welfare situation are issues. The writer feels she misrepresented her ability to get pregnant and is now hesitating, leading to the need for a more invasive procedure. The key points here are the girlfriend's honesty about her fertility history, her delay in the abortion process, and the writer's role in pressuring her to abort.\n\nNow, the main ethical dilemma is about reproductive rights and autonomy. The girlfriend is making the decision about her own body. Even if the writer has concerns about being a parent, the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is typically up to the person carrying the child. The fact that the woman is the one facing the physical and emotional consequences of the pregnancy and the abortion means she has the right to make that choice, even if the partner disagrees.\n\nThe writer's argument that the girlfriend is irresponsible for delaying the process might be valid in terms of the procedure's invasiveness, but that's a consequence of the timing laws, not necessarily her fault. Also, the girlfriend's hesitation could stem from various reasons, including emotional struggles with the decision, not just procrastination. The writer's frustration about her using vulgar language and the previous pregnancy might be personal opinions but don't negate her right to decide.\n\nThe writer might feel betrayed because she didn't disclose her past pregnancy and fertility status, but that's a separate issue about honesty in the relationship. However, the core question is about the author pressuring her to abort. Even if they have valid concerns, the decision isn't theirs to make. Pressuring someone into an abortion can be seen as controlling and not respecting her autonomy.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, autonomy is a key principle, so the author's actions could be seen as violating her rights. The answer might depend on cultural context, but in general, reproductive decisions are the individual's choice. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for pressuring her to abort, despite the circumstances.\n"
