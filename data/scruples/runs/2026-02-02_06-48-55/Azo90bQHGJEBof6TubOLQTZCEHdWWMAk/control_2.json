Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend got pregnant, and the guy is pressuring her to have an abortion, which she eventually agreed to but is now hesitant. The guy is upset because she didn't get it done sooner and is angry about some things she revealed, like not being told she can't get pregnant and hiding a past pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The user is from Denmark, where abortion is legal up to 12 weeks. The girlfriend is at 8 weeks, so the surgical option is available. The guy wants her to have the abortion, but she's been slow in the process. The key points here are consent and autonomy. The woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. Even if the guy is against the pregnancy, the decision ultimately lies with her. \n\nThe guy's arguments include his inability to support a child financially and her mental health issues. But he's also implying she's not capable of making good decisions, which might not be his place to judge. The girlfriend used harsh language about the abortion, which might be troubling, but that's her emotional response. The guy is upset she didn't get it done sooner, leading to the need for a surgical procedure, but the delay might be due to her hesitation and not just his fault.\n\nHe also mentions she lied about not being able to get pregnant and hiding a past pregnancy. However, even if she misrepresented her fertility, that doesn't give him the right to demand an abortion. The woman's right to her reproductive choices is a big factor here. The guy's main issue is that she didn't act quickly enough, but the decision to proceed with the abortion was hers to make. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, pregnancy and parenting require mutual agreement, but if there's a disagreement, the woman's rights take precedence. The guy's frustration is understandable, but pressuring her to have an abortion could be seen as controlling. However, in this case, he's the one advocating for the abortion, which is his choice, but the final decision rests with her. Since she changed her mind at the last minute, maybe he feels betrayed, but he's not in the wrong for wanting the abortion. The main issue is whether he's overstepping by pressuring her, but since he's the one who wants the termination, he's not necessarily at fault. The answer is likely B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
