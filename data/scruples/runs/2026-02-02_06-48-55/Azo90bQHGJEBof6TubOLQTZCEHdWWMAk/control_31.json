      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe guy is 22, his girlfriend 23, from Europe, specifically Denmark. They started dating in August. The girlfriend has PCOS and told him she can't get pregnant. She also mentioned that if she ever did, she'd just get an abortion. Now, she's pregnant, and they found out two weeks ago. She went to the gynecologist and was told she's 8 weeks along. In Denmark, abortions before 8 weeks are chemical, and after that, surgical. The girlfriend was slow in the process: she forgot to buy a test, missed a day at the doctor, got a later appointment. The author is concerned because he works a lot and can't be there for a child, and she's on welfare with mental health issues. She claims that having a baby isn't stressful, but he knows from his parents that it is. She uses vulgar language about killing the baby. Then she reveals she was pregnant 10 years ago, which the author sees as a red flag because she said she couldn't get pregnant and that PCOS came after her last pregnancy, but no doctor actually confirmed that. The author never said he wanted a child yet and has been firm in his no. At the gynecologist, she was asked if she wanted the abortion but said no, then decided to ask him again. He felt she misused his trust by not being honest about her fertility and hiding a past pregnancy. He's upset she was slow, leading to a surgical procedure, and doesn't feel bad for her if she hadn't delayed.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? A or B.\n\nFirst, let's consider the key points. The author told his girlfriend to abort because they aren't ready for a child. The girlfriend had been upfront about her PCOS and possible infertility, but later revealed she had a past pregnancy. The author is concerned about her not seeking immediate medical attention, causing the abortion to be surgical instead of chemical. Also, her use of vulgar language about abortion is a point raised by the author.\n\nNow, the legal context in Denmark allows abortions up to 12 weeks, but the method depends on the gestational age. The girlfriend delayed the process, which moved her to the surgical category. The author's main arguments are that he's not ready for a child, she's not in a stable financial or emotional position, and she wasn't honest about her past pregnancy and fertility status.\n\nBut the girlfriend's side is that she had PCOS, which can cause infertility, but no doctor explicitly said she couldn't get pregnant. She may have made a mistake or lied about her fertility. Also, her past pregnancy could mean she's fertile, which contradicts her earlier statements. The author is pressuring her to have an abortion, which she's now hesitating about. Her hesitation might be due to the procedure being more involved now (surgical vs. chemical) and the risk of future infertility.\n\nEthically, the author is making a decision that affects the pregnancy without considering the girlfriend's autonomy. Even if she delayed, the decision to terminate is hers. The author's role is to support her decision, not dictate it. Also, if she misrepresented her medical history, that's an issue of trust. But by the time the author is asking her to abort, the pregnancy is already at 8 weeks, so the method is determined by the medical timeline. The girlfriend's delay could be due to her own emotional process, which the author is now criticizing. However, the author's direct instruction to abort could be seen as coercive. In many ethical frameworks, both partners should make such decisions together or the woman's autonomy should be respected, especially in legal contexts where the decision is hers. The author's use of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) might be because he's conflicted about his role in pressuring her. The girlfriend's past pregnancy might have been a factor, but the author's main action is telling her she must abort. Even if she was slow, the author shouldn't force her to make that choice. Also, her use of vulgar language might be a way to cope with the situation. The author's concerns about financial and emotional readiness are valid, but the way he's handling it could be problematic. The girlfriend's hesitation now might indicate she's reconsidering, and the author's insistence could be invalidating her feelings. So the answer would likely be A, meaning the author is in the wrong because he's pressuring her to make a decision without respecting her autonomy, even if there were past deceptions.\n"
