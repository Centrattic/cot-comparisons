Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy is asking if he's at fault for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. They're both in their early 20s in Europe. They've been dating since August, and she mentioned she has PCOS and can't get pregnant. But now she is pregnant, and he wants her to get an abortion. The key points to consider here are communication, trust, and responsibility.\n\nFirst, she had told him she couldn't get pregnant because of PCOS. But it turns out she was pregnant before 10 years ago, and PCOS might have developed after that. So maybe she wasn't entirely truthful about her fertility. That could be a breach of trust. Also, she's been slow in the abortion process, which led to needing a surgical procedure instead of a chemical one, which she now knows might affect her future fertility. He feels she's misused his trust by not being honest about her past pregnancy and her actual chances of conceiving.\n\nThen there's the question of his responsibility. He's not ready for a kid, mentions his work schedule, financial situation, and the stress of parenthood. He's also supporting her financially since she's on welfare. But he's asking her to abort, which is a major decision. The girlfriend is hesitant and even says she doesn't want to abort, which complicates things. She also uses harsh language like \"kill the baby,\" which might have upset him.\n\nThe legal aspect in Denmark allows abortion up to 12 weeks, and she's now at 8 weeks. She delayed getting an appointment, which pushed her into the surgical procedure window. He's upset about her delays and the potential future infertility. But is he in the wrong? Well, he's not the one carrying the pregnancy, so the decision isn't his to make. However, he's pressuring her to abort, which could be seen as controlling, especially if she's not fully on board.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe because he's pressuring her and not respecting her autonomy. But others might argue that he's just being realistic about their situation. The fact that she hid her past pregnancy and misled him about her fertility could make him feel betrayed. But even with that, telling her to abort is a significant decision. He might not be in the wrong if he's being honest about his unwillingness, but he might be overstepping by dictating her choice. The answer hinges on whether his actions are seen as controlling versus him being honest about his own stance.\n"
