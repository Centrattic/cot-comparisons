Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy and his girlfriend found out she's pregnant. He asked her to get an abortion, and she's been dragging her feet in the process. She initially said she couldn't get pregnant because of PCOS, but later admitted she was pregnant ten years ago. The guy is upset because he didn't want a child yet, and he's concerned about their financial situation and future. She's been slow in scheduling appointments, which led to needing a surgical abortion instead of a chemical one. He also mentions she's been using vulgar language about aborting the baby and questioned his reasons for not wanting the child.\n\nSo, the key points are: he didn't want to be a parent yet, he asked her to abort, she delayed the process, and there were some hidden facts from her side. Now, the question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFrom what I understand, in many places, including Denmark, the decision to have an abortion is typically the woman's. The man can express his opinion, but ultimately, it's her choice. However, in this case, she initially had no intention of continuing the pregnancy but then changed her mind or delayed the process. The guy's main argument is that he didn't want a child and felt she was misrepresenting her fertility and past. \n\nBut the problem here is that he's pressuring her to abort. Even if he has valid reasons (like not being ready, financial issues), the fact that he's the one making the decision might be an issue. In most ethical and legal contexts, the woman has autonomy over her body. So if he's insisting she terminate the pregnancy against her wishes, that's problematic. However, in this case, she said she would get an abortion if she got pregnant, but then hesitated. So there's a conflict here. \n\nShe did delay the process, which led to needing a surgical procedure. The guy feels she's misused his trust by not disclosing her past pregnancy and maybe lying about her fertility. But the bigger issue is his role in the situation. Even if she delayed, he's pressuring her to abort, which could be seen as wrong because the decision isn't his to make. \n\nAlso, her using vulgar language about killing the baby might be a red flag, but that doesn't give him the right to make decisions for her. If she's now unsure about the abortion, his insistence might be overstepping. \n\nLegally and ethically, the woman has the right to decide. So if he's pressuring her to abort when she's now uncertain, he's in the wrong. However, if he's just expressing his stance and she's making the decision, it's different. But in this case, he's actively telling her to get an abortion, which is not his place. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is AITA? The guy is in the wrong because he's pressuring her to terminate a pregnancy when the decision should be hers. Even if he has valid concerns, he's not the one to make that choice for her. Therefore, the answer is A (he is in the wrong).\n"
