Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. \n\nFirst, the situation: They're both in their early 20s, in Europe, specifically Denmark. The girlfriend has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. She mentioned that if she did get pregnant, she'd get an abortion. Now she's pregnant, and he's pushing her to have the abortion. She's been slow in the process, maybe because she's hesitant. He's giving reasons like not being able to support a child financially and stress. She's on welfare, has mental health issues, and he's helping her out financially as long as she works towards a future. \n\nHe's upset because she said she couldn't get pregnant before, but now she's pregnant, and he found out she was pregnant before, which he sees as a red flag. She told her gynecologist she didn't want the abortion until she talked to him, and instead of rescheduling, she waited. He feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her past pregnancy and her fertility. He also thinks she's causing unnecessary stress by delaying the process, leading to a surgical abortion instead of a chemical one.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider the key points:\n\n1. **Consent and Decision-Making**: In most places, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is the woman's right. The man's influence here might be overstepping. Even if they're in a relationship, the final decision shouldn't be forced on her. He's pressuring her to abort, which could be seen as controlling.\n\n2. **Honesty and Trust**: She mentioned she had a past pregnancy, which he found out about later. He's upset because she didn't disclose it earlier. However, unless she was hiding it maliciously, maybe she just didn't consider it important until now. His trust might be shaken, but that doesn't necessarily make him right to demand an abortion.\n\n3. **Reasons for the Abortion**: He cites financial and emotional stress as his main reasons. While these are valid concerns, they're also personal and may not justify pressuring her. The woman has her own reasons, like not being ready or the risks involved. His argument that she's being slow causing a more invasive procedure could be a point, but the responsibility for the decision lies with her.\n\n4. **Communication Issues**: He says she used vulgar language when talking about abortion, which might indicate her own discomfort. His response to her hesitation by pushing for the abortion could be seen as dismissive of her feelings.\n\n5. **Legal and Ethical Aspects**: In Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks. She's at 8 weeks, so the delay is causing a switch in procedure. His frustration about the method is understandable, but again, the decision is hers. Legally, he can't force her to have an abortion, and ethically, respecting her autonomy is key.\n\n6. **Trust and Honesty**: He's upset about the past pregnancy and her fertility claims. If she had a previous pregnancy and PCOS, maybe the fertility issue was misdiagnosed. His anger over this could be valid, but using it to justify pressuring an abortion might not be the right approach.\n\nPutting it all together: The man is in a position where he's trying to manage the situation based on his own concerns, but the key issue is that the decision to terminate a pregnancy isn't his to make. His actions could be seen as controlling and disrespectful of her autonomy. Even if he's not directly forcing her, the pressure and the way he's handling the situation might be inconsiderate of her feelings and rights. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he's in a tough spot, trying to support her while also being honest about his own limitations. But the fact remains that he's pressuring her to abort, which could be seen as wrong regardless of his intentions. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's overstepping by pressuring her for an abortion when it's her decision, and there's a lack of respect for her autonomy in the process.\n"
