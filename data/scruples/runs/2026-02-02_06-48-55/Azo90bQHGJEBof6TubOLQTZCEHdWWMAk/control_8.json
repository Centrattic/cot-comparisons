Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who asked for an abortion is in the wrong, based on the situation described. The author is a 22-year-old man in Europe, specifically Denmark, who is in a relationship with a 23-year-old woman. They've been dating since August, and during that time, she told him she has PCOS and can't get pregnant, even stating she would get an abortion if she did. Now they found out she's pregnant, and she's been delaying the abortion process, leading to a surgical one instead of a chemical one. The author is upset because he doesn't want a child now, mentions practical issues like his work, her financial situation, and her mental health. He also learns she was pregnant 10 years ago, which contradicts her claim that PCOS only started after that pregnancy. The woman is using vulgar language about the abortion and is hesitant, leading the author to question her trustworthiness and feel she misused his trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks, which is the case here. The woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including continuing or terminating the pregnancy. However, the author is pressuring her to have an abortion, which raises questions about autonomy. The woman's hesitation and delays could be due to her own emotional or psychological reasons, which the author is interpreting as misuse of trust. But from her perspective, she might be conflicted. The author is also critical of her past pregnancy and her PCOS status, suggesting deception. However, if she was honest about her potential inability to conceive, but later found out she was pregnant, then her initial statements might have been based on her medical condition, not a lie. The fact that she had a previous pregnancy doesn't necessarily mean she was lying about PCOS, unless a doctor explicitly said she couldn't get pregnant again. The author's argument about her delaying the process is about the method of abortion (chemical vs. surgical), but her reasons for the delay might be personal and valid. The author is also making assumptions about her decisions and the reasons behind them, which might not be fair. Ethically, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is the woman's right, and the author's insistence might be overstepping. However, there's also the aspect of their relationship dynamics and mutual trust. The author feels betrayed by her past pregnancy and her current hesitancy, but he's also being critical of her life circumstances. The key issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring her to abort the pregnancy against her will, or if her actions (delays, past pregnancy) make her at fault. Legally and ethically, the woman has the right to choose, so the author's insistence could be seen as wrong. But if she was deceptive about her medical history, that could complicate things. However, the author is the one pushing for an abortion, which is a significant decision that affects her body and life. So, the author's actions might be considered in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy, even if he has disagreements with her decisions. The question is whether he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion, which is a personal choice. If he's pressuring her to make a decision she's not comfortable with, that's problematic. On the other hand, she's the one who is hesitant and delaying, which might lead to complications. The answer would depend on whose rights and autonomy are being respected. In many contexts, the woman's right to choose is paramount, so the author's pressure could be seen as wrong. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong (A), but I need to consider cultural and legal contexts as well. In Denmark, abortion rights are strong, so the woman's decision is her own. The author's insistence might be overstepping, making him at fault. But if she was withholding information (previous pregnancy), that's her fault. However, the main question is about the author's action of telling her to abort. If that's pressuring her, then he's in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
