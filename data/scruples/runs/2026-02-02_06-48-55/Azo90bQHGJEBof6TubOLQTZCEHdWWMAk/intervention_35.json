Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend had an unexpected pregnancy after claiming she couldn't get pregnant due to PCOS. The author is questioning if he's at fault for suggesting an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend had PCOS and said she couldn't get pregnant. She also mentioned she would get an abortion if it happened. However, she ended up pregnant, and the author is upset about her delay in getting the abortion, which now requires a surgical procedure instead of a pill. She also lied about being pregnant before and about her fertility, which the author finds deceptive.\n\nThe author is conflicted because he's not ready for a child and they both have financial and personal issues. He's frustrated with her delays and perceived lack of commitment to getting the abortion. He feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her past pregnancy and fertility status.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting an abortion. From a legal standpoint in Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks, and the method depends on the gestational age. The girlfriend's delay moved her to the surgical procedure. The author is concerned about the risks to her future fertility and their ability to care for a child. \n\nBut here's the thing: the decision to have an abortion is typically a personal one, especially when it comes to reproductive rights. The girlfriend has the legal right to make that decision, and the author is pressuring her to do so, which might be valid if they both agree. However, the author is also pointing out her inconsistencies and delays. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior\u2014delaying the process, using vulgar language, and lying about her medical history\u2014could be seen as problematic. The author is not in the wrong for expressing his concerns and wanting her to proceed with the abortion, especially if they had prior discussions about not wanting children yet. However, the ethical aspect here is more nuanced. Suggesting an abortion isn't inherently wrong, but the context involves trust issues and her actions.\n\nBut since the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion, the answer would depend on the ethical perspective. If the girlfriend is making the final decision, and the author is supporting her, but in this case, she's hesitating, then the author's stance isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way he's presenting the situation\u2014accusing her of misuse and being deceptive\u2014might indicate a breach of trust on her part rather than him being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting her to get the abortion, especially given her history and the circumstances. The main issues lie with the girlfriend's actions, not the author's suggestion.\n"
