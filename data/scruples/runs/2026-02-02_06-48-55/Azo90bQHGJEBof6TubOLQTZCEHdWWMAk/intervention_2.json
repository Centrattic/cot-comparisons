Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author advising his girlfriend to have an abortion. The girlfriend has PCOS, previously said she can't get pregnant, and had an abortion ten years ago. Now she's pregnant again, and the author is pushing for an abortion. She's been slow in the process, leading to a surgical abortion being necessary. The author feels she misused his trust by lying about her fertility and hiding her past pregnancy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is pressuring his girlfriend to abort a pregnancy. Even if they're not ready for children, the decision should be mutual and respectful. The girlfriend has her own reasons for hesitating, maybe emotional or psychological. The author's use of her past statements about not being able to get pregnant could be a factor here. If she didn't actually have a medical confirmation of infertility, he might have relied on a misconception. Also, he's dismissing her views on stress and parenting, which could be invalidating her perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is concerned about their current life situations\u2014work, financial stability, mental health. These are valid considerations. However, the key issue is whether he's in the wrong for advising the abortion. The girlfriend's autonomy is crucial here. Even if she's made mistakes in the process, the author shouldn't unilaterally decide her medical choices. The fact that he's using her past statements and her current delays to justify his stance might show a lack of empathy and understanding. He's also using derogatory language about the abortion, which could add pressure on her.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions\u2014being slow in the process, changing her mind about abortion, using vulgar terms\u2014might indicate her own internal conflict. The author's frustration is understandable, but the responsibility for the decision should rest with her, as it's her body. The author's insistence might be overstepping, especially if he's not considering her feelings and valid concerns. Also, the revelation about her past pregnancy without prior disclosure is a point she might have had her reasons for keeping private.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, while the author's intentions are to avoid responsibility and stress, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is generally the woman's right. The author's pressure could be seen as controlling. The fact that she was hesitant and needed time to process, while the author is pushing for an immediate decision, might tip the balance towards him being in the wrong. He should have supported her in making an informed choice rather than dictating it.\n"
