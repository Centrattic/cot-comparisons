Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author told their girlfriend to get an abortion. The girlfriend has PCOS, said she couldn't get pregnant, and if she did, she'd just abort. They found out she was pregnant, but she was slow in getting tested and seeing the doctor. She ended up needing a surgical abortion because she delayed. The author feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her ability to get pregnant and hiding a past pregnancy. The author doesn't want kids now, and the girlfriend is hesitant and slow in the process, leading to the surgical option.\n\nFirst, the author asked his girlfriend to abort the pregnancy. The key here is whether he had the right to pressure her or make that decision for her. Even if they had discussed her stance on abortion before, once she's pregnant, the decision is more about her body and her rights. The author might be overstepping by dictating her choices. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior: she delayed testing and appointments, leading to the need for a surgical abortion. But she might have her own reasons for the delays\u2014maybe fear, anxiety, or uncertainty. The author is criticizing her for being slow, but her decisions are personal. Also, she mentioned that she wanted to discuss the abortion with him, showing she valued his opinion.\n\nThe author's argument is that he's not ready for a child, they have financial issues, etc. But he's making her make a decision based on their circumstances. However, that doesn't absolve him of being the sole decision-maker. The girlfriend's right to choose what happens with her body is a significant factor here.\n\nThe girlfriend's past pregnancy: she told him she couldn't get pregnant, but she had been pregnant before. That's a red flag for the author, but it's not necessarily her fault if her medical information was incorrect. Doctors might not have given her a definitive infertility diagnosis. The author's trust might be broken here, but again, it's not her fault if the information was misleading due to medical uncertainty.\n\nThe author is using the girlfriend's delays as a reason to not feel bad about pressuring her. But if she's going through the process and is hesitant, that's her right. The fact that she's hesitant and slow doesn't mean she shouldn't be allowed to proceed with the abortion. The author is taking a stance that she should have acted faster, but that's not his decision to make.\n\nAlso, the way the author is framing the situation\u2014like \"she needs the surgical procedure because she delayed\"\u2014suggests he's blaming her for the method of abortion. But he's contributing to the pressure for her to act. The girlfriend's hesitation might be due to her own feelings about the pregnancy or the procedure.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is in a position where he's making the decision for her. Even if they discussed abortion before, once the pregnancy is real, the decision should be hers. The author's role is to support her decision, not dictate it. He's using the circumstances (her delays leading to a surgical abortion) as justification, but that's not a valid reason to pressure her.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is overstepping by pressuring his girlfriend to abort the pregnancy. Even if they have financial and life issues, the decision should be hers. His criticism of her delays and medical history doesn't justify making her go through with the abortion. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
