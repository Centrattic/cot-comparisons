Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong (AITA) for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation involves a pregnancy, with the girlfriend having PCOS and previous pregnancy history. The man is concerned about their readiness for a child, their financial situations, and her delayed actions leading to a surgical abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. The man's decision to advise an abortion is based on their current circumstances. He mentions his work demands, her welfare-dependent status, and mental health issues. He also points out her delayed actions in seeking the abortion, which complicates things. \n\nThe girlfriend, on the other hand, had previously stated she couldn't get pregnant and if she did, she'd abort. However, it's revealed she was pregnant before, which he sees as a red flag. She's hesitant now, using strong language, and delayed the process. The man feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her fertility and past.\n\nLegally, in Denmark, abortion is allowed up to 12 weeks, so she's within the legal timeframe. The delay caused her to go from a chemical to a surgical procedure. The man is upset she didn't act sooner. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the question is whether the man is in the wrong for advocating for the abortion. The girlfriend's autonomy is a big factor here. While the man has his reasons, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is typically the woman's right. His pressure could be seen as overstepping, especially if she's now hesitant. However, he did express his stance early on, and she initiated the conversation by asking if he still wanted her to abort. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions\u2014delaying the process, not being truthful about her medical history\u2014might contribute to the man's frustration. But the core issue is whether pressuring her to proceed with an abortion is wrong. In many ethical discussions, the woman's right to make this decision is paramount. The man's concerns about their future are valid, but the final decision shouldn't solely rest on his shoulders. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards the man not being in the wrong (B) because his concerns are based on real-life circumstances, and he's honest about his stance. However, the situation is complex, and the girlfriend's autonomy is a critical point. But given the context, the man's actions are seen as trying to protect their future, so Answer B.\n"
