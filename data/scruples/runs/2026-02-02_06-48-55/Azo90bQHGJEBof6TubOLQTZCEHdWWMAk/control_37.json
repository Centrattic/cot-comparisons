Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is asking if they're at fault for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. They mention that their girlfriend, who is 23, has PCOS and claimed she couldn't get pregnant. She also said that if she ever got pregnant, she would just get an abortion. They started dating in August, and she got pregnant in October. The author is 22, and they're both in Europe, specifically Denmark.\n\nThe girlfriend delayed the process of getting an abortion. She was slow in buying a test, missed a doctor's appointment, and took longer to get another one. The author points out that in Denmark, getting an immediate appointment is possible and free. The author is concerned about their ability to support a child, mentioning work stress, financial issues, and their girlfriend's current situation on welfare with mental health issues. The girlfriend uses vulgar language when talking about the abortion, like saying she'll \"kill the baby.\" Also, she revealed that she was pregnant 10 years ago, which the author sees as a red flag because she had previously said she couldn't get pregnant.\n\nThe key points here are about consent, trust, and decision-making. The author is upset because the girlfriend didn't get the abortion immediately, leading to a surgical one with higher risks. They also feel she misrepresented her fertility and hid her previous pregnancy. The author didn't want a child yet and made that clear. The girlfriend, however, delayed the process, which the author sees as not taking the situation seriously.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author is in a relationship and has the right to express their feelings and concerns, especially regarding a pregnancy. However, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is typically the woman's right, especially in countries where abortion is legal. The author is advising her to abort, which is their personal stance, but the fact that she delayed the process and the author is now blaming her for needing a surgical abortion raises questions about control and autonomy.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong if they're pressuring her into a decision she's not fully committed to. However, the girlfriend's actions in delaying the process and her previous statements about abortion might contribute to the situation. The author is also revealing that she had a prior pregnancy, which the author didn't know about, which complicates the trust aspect.\n\nBut ultimately, the decision to have an abortion is the woman's, and the author's role is to support her decision. If the author is pressuring her or making the decision for her, that could be problematic. However, in this case, the author is stating their own stance and pointing out what they see as her failures in the process. The girlfriend did consult with him before the procedure, so it's a mutual decision to some extent.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is at fault for not wanting to be a parent and advising her to abort. Since the law allows for abortion up to 12 weeks, and the girlfriend delayed, the author's frustration is understandable. However, the author's right to make that decision is not absolute; it's her body and her pregnancy. So, while the author's perspective is valid in terms of their own feelings and the situation, the ethical responsibility lies with the girlfriend to make the decision.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong for expressing their position and concerns, especially since they made their stance clear. The girlfriend's actions contributed to the situation, but the final decision is hers. So the answer is B (No).\n"
