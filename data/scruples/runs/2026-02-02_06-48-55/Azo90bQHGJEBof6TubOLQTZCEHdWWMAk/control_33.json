Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted on Reddit is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation involves a couple where the girlfriend has PCOS and claimed she couldn't get pregnant. They found out she's pregnant, and she's been delaying the abortion process, leading to needing a surgical one. The author is upset because she mislead him about her fertility and hid a past pregnancy. The key points are the girlfriend's initial claims, her delay in getting the abortion, the author's concerns about their situation, and the girlfriend's change in stance.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend told the author she couldn't get pregnant, but later revealed she had been pregnant before. This is a significant issue because it shows she might have misled him. The author is upset about being lied to, which is understandable. Next, the girlfriend's delays caused her to need a surgical abortion, which the author sees as her being hesitant. The author is concerned about their ability to support a child now, given their financial situations and work commitments. The girlfriend uses vulgar language about abortion and changed her mind during the process, which the author finds problematic.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the girlfriend's actions led to the need for a more invasive procedure and that she's not taking the author's concerns seriously. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting her to proceed with the abortion. In the context of consent and responsibility, both should have discussed their plans regarding pregnancy before it happened. The author is clear he's not ready for a child, so advocating for an abortion isn't inherently wrong. However, the girlfriend's delays and lack of communication might be her fault. The author's frustration is about trust and her not being transparent, which is a valid concern. But in terms of the abortion itself, the author's stance is based on their current circumstances. Since the decision to terminate is hers (depending on local laws), but the author is not the one who can make that decision. However, in Denmark, the woman has the right to decide. The author's role is to support her decision, but he's expressing his own stance.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for stating his position, though the situation is complex. The key issue is the girlfriend's dishonesty and delays, not the author's decision. So the answer is B.\n"
