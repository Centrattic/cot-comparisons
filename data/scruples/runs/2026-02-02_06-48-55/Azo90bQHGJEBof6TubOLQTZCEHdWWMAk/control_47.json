Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who asked the question (the author) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple is in a relationship, both in their early 20s. The girlfriend has PCOS and was told she can't get pregnant. She's been clear from the start that if she ever did get pregnant, she'd have an abortion. Now she's pregnant, but she's delaying the process, which means she'll need a surgical abortion. The author is against having a child right now due to their life circumstances. The girlfriend is hesitant, uses harsh language about abortion, and the author finds out she was pregnant before, which he sees as a red flag. The girlfriend didn't reschedule her appointment but instead asked him again, and he feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her past pregnancy and fertility.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The author is advocating for an abortion, which is his right, especially since both partners need to agree on such a decision. However, the girlfriend's autonomy is crucial here. She has the right to make decisions about her own body, even if he disagrees. The author's concern about her delay leading to a surgical abortion might be based on his own views, but it's not her decision to make. The fact that she didn't reschedule and instead asked him again might indicate she's seeking his input, but ultimately, the decision should be hers. \n\nAlso, the author is critical of her for not acting faster, which could be seen as placing blame on her for the situation. The girlfriend's mental health and financial situation are factors, but the author is also relying on her to work towards a future. However, this is a complex situation where both partners have their own pressures.\n\nLegally, in Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks. The girlfriend's delay pushed her to the surgical option, but that's her choice. The author's frustration about her past pregnancy and PCOS isn't directly his business unless it affects their relationship. The main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for pressuring her to abort. Since the decision should be hers, his insistence might overstep. However, the girlfriend's actions (delaying, not being honest) could be seen as problematic as well.\n\nThe author is not in the wrong for expressing his position, but he might be overstepping by pressuring her decision. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer likely leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the decision isn't his to make, but he's stating his stance. However, if he's using the situation to control her choice, then it could be A. But based on the information, he's not forcing her but stating his position. So, B.\n"
