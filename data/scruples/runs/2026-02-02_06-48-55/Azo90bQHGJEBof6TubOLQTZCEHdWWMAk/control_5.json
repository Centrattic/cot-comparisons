Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend found out she's pregnant. They both knew she has PCOS and thought she couldn't get pregnant. She told him that if she ever got pregnant, she'd just abort. Now, she's at 8 weeks, and the procedure will be surgical because she delayed. The author is upset because she hid her past pregnancy, didn't act quickly, and now is hesitant to terminate. He's questioning her decisions and even told her to get an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks, so she's within the time frame. The author is pressuring her to abort, but she's now hesitant. However, the decision to have an abortion is a personal one and should be the woman's choice. The author is making her feel guilty and questioning her decisions, which could be controlling. Even though they had discussed her stance beforehand, circumstances might have changed for her. She's also dealing with her own issues like welfare, mental health, and past trauma (the hidden pregnancy). \n\nThe author mentions she uses vulgar language about the abortion, which might indicate her discomfort or fear. He's also using his work and financial stress as reasons against having a child. But he's the one pushing for termination, which could be his way of avoiding responsibility. However, he's not forcing her; he's stating his reasons and his stance. \n\nShe delayed the process, which led to a surgical procedure. The author is upset about that because she could have acted faster. But maybe her hesitation is due to her own fears or uncertainty. The author is in a position where he's making a judgment call about her medical decisions, which might be overstepping. Even if they had initial agreements, the situation has evolved, and she's now conflicted. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy and consent. The woman has the right to make her own reproductive choices, even if it's against the partner's wishes. The author's role should be supportive, not dictatorial. By pressuring her and not respecting her hesitance, he's in the wrong. Also, revealing her past pregnancy was a red flag, but she's the one who withheld information. However, the main issue is his insistence on the abortion despite her changing stance. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and is pressuring her into a decision that she's now uncertain about. The answer should be A.\n"
