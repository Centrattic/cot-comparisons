Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple is in a new relationship, and the girlfriend has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. But she actually got pregnant. The author is 22, and she's 23. The key points here are her history of PCOS, her previous pregnancy that she didn't mention, and her hesitation in getting an abortion.\n\nThe author is concerned about their financial and emotional readiness for a child. He works a lot, she's on welfare, and he doesn't think either of them can handle a kid right now. The girlfriend, on the other hand, delayed the abortion process, leading to a surgical procedure that might affect her future fertility. She also uses harsh language like \"kill the baby,\" which might be disturbing.\n\nThe author is upset because she didn't reschedule the appointment quickly and now faces a more complicated procedure. He also found out she was pregnant before, which contradicts her claims about PCOS. He told her to get an abortion because he's not ready and they can't afford to have a child.\n\nNow, considering the ethical side. The woman has the right to make decisions about her body. The author is pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy, which could be seen as controlling. Even if he's not ready, the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is typically up to the woman. His arguments about their financial situation and his work might be valid concerns, but he can't make the decision for her. Also, her hesitation might be due to personal or emotional reasons, not just being slow. The author's frustration with her delays and her past could make him seem dismissive of her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, her delaying the process might have been due to her own struggles, mental health, or uncertainty. The author might feel betrayed by her past pregnancy and her initial claims about infertility. However, even if she made mistakes, the abortion decision should be hers. The author's main issue is that she didn't act faster, leading to a surgical abortion, but that's a result of her decisions, not his.\n\nIn terms of legal context in Denmark, the procedure changes after 8 weeks, but the law allows for abortion up to 12 weeks. The author isn't forcing her; he's expressed his stance and she chose not to proceed. However, by not rescheduling and getting the abortion, she's moving forward without his input, which might be why he's upset.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's not the one carrying the pregnancy, so his input is valid, but ultimately, the decision should be hers. Pressuring her to terminate might be crossing a line, especially if he's not respecting her autonomy. However, he's also expressing his concerns about their ability to handle a child, which is a valid perspective. The fact that she hid her past pregnancy and PCOS might have contributed to the trust issues.\n\nI think the author's main mistake is telling her to get an abortion, which is her choice. Even if he's not ready, he can't make that decision for her. His arguments are about their future, but the ethical responsibility lies with her. So, yes, he might be in the wrong for pressuring her. But maybe not entirely, depending on the relationship dynamics. However, given that she's the one facing the physical consequences, her autonomy is key here. So the answer is A.\n"
