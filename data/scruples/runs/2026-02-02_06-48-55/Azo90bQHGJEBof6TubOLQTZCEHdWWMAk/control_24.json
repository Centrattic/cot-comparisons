Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is about a couple in Europe, both in their early 20s. The girlfriend found out she's pregnant after having PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. They had discussed that if she ever got pregnant, she would get an abortion. But now she's hesitating, causing delays, and the author is frustrated. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is asking if they're at fault for telling their GF to abort. The key points are: she had PCOS, said she couldn't get pregnant, but now is pregnant. She delayed getting the abortion, leading to a surgical one needed instead of a chemical one. She also mentioned she had a past pregnancy that she didn't disclose. \n\nIn Denmark, the legal limit for abortion is up to 12 weeks, which she's at 8 weeks now. The author is concerned about their financial situation, her mental health, and their ability to care for a child. She uses vulgar language about the abortion, which the author finds offensive. The author feels she's been dishonest about her ability to get pregnant and the past pregnancy.\n\nNow, looking at the ethical aspects. The author is pressuring the girlfriend to have an abortion, which is her decision. Even if they had discussed it before, the right to choose is hers. The author's reasons for wanting the abortion seem practical, like financial stability and readiness. But in many places, including Denmark, the decision to terminate is the woman's, and the partner's influence might not be legally or ethically acceptable. \n\nThe girlfriend's delays could be due to stress, uncertainty, or other factors. The author is blaming her for the delays, but that could be invalid. Also, the author is frustrated she hid her past pregnancy, but maybe she had her reasons. However, the author is now questioning her credibility on whether she can get pregnant again, which complicates things.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author's pressure on the girlfriend to abort makes them at fault. Ethically, the woman's autonomy is crucial. Even if the author has valid concerns, the decision isn't his to make. Pressuring someone to terminate a pregnancy can be seen as wrong, regardless of the reasons. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong for pressuring the girlfriend to abort, as it's her choice. The answer would be A.\n"
