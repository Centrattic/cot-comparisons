Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a 22-year-old guy in Europe, and his girlfriend (GF) is 23. They've been dating since August, and she told him she has PCOS and can't get pregnant. She also said she would get an abortion if she ever became pregnant. Now, she's pregnant, and they found out two weeks ago. She's eight weeks along, which in Denmark means a surgical abortion is needed if she waits past that. \n\nThe author is the one asking if he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. He lists several points: she was slow in getting a pregnancy test, missed a doctor's appointment, and delayed the process. He also mentions that she's been using vulgar language when talking about the abortion, like \"kill the baby.\" She told him she had a past pregnancy around 10 years ago, which he sees as a red flag because she claimed she couldn't get pregnant and that PCOS started after a pregnancy (but no doctor confirmed that). \n\nHe also feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her fertility and past pregnancy. He's stressed because of his job and their financial situations, and he's worried about the future if they have a child now. The GF is on welfare, has mental health issues, and relies on him financially. The author is against having a child now and wanted her to abort, but she hesitated and delayed the process, leading to the need for a surgical procedure instead of a chemical one. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The girlfriend is making a decision about her own body. Even if the author is against having a child now, the decision to abort is typically the woman's to make. The author might feel betrayed because she was slow in the process, but that doesn't necessarily give him the right to pressure her into an abortion. \n\nThe girl's hesitation could be due to her own fears or internal conflict. She might have changed her mind or felt pressured by the author. Her history of pregnancy and PCOS being unconfirmed could mean she's dealing with her own health issues and the stress of this situation. Also, the fact that she initially said she would get an abortion but now is hesitating might indicate a change in her stance, which could be valid. \n\nThe author's argument is that she delayed the process, leading to a more invasive procedure. However, in Denmark, the legal limit is 12 weeks, so up to that point, she can choose. If she's choosing not to proceed now, it's her decision. The author's frustration about the stress and financial aspects is understandable, but it's not his decision alone. \n\nThe use of vulgar language by the GF is concerning. She's dehumanizing the fetus, which might indicate a lack of respect or a way to cope. The author might feel that she's not taking the situation seriously, but that's a judgment call. \n\nThe author's own behavior: he's telling her to abort, which could be seen as controlling. Even if they're in a relationship, reproductive decisions are hers to make. The fact that she wanted to consult him before proceeding shows she values his opinion, but ultimately, the choice is hers. \n\nThe author is also pointing out that she didn't reschedule the appointment, leading to the need for surgery. But if she's decided against the abortion now, even if it's later, she has the right to make that choice. \n\nEthically, the author is in the wrong if he's pressuring her to abort against her will. However, if she's the one who wants to keep the child and he's against it, then he's not in the wrong for expressing his stance. But the way he's handling it\u2014telling her to abort, possibly without her consent\u2014could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the author is using her delays as a reason to feel less empathy towards her. That seems harsh. Her delays might stem from anxiety, fear, or other personal reasons. It's not fair to blame her for being slow in a process that's emotionally taxing. \n\nIn terms of trust, the author feels she misrepresented her fertility. If she told him she couldn't get pregnant, but actually can, and hid her past pregnancy, that's a breach of trust. However, that's separate from the abortion decision. His reaction to her decisions now might be influenced by that breach. \n\nOverall, the author is in a complicated situation. While he's not in the wrong for expressing his concerns and preferences, pressuring her to terminate a wanted pregnancy could be seen as controlling. However, if she's changed her mind and wants to keep the child, and he's against it, then his stance is within his rights, but it's a matter of mutual respect and understanding. \n\nThe key here is that the decision to abort is the woman's, and the author shouldn't impose his will on her. If she's decided against the abortion now, he can't force her to proceed. His frustration and stress are valid, but they don't override her autonomy. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong if he's pressuring her to abort against her wishes. \n\nBut there's another angle: if she's the one who initially said she would get an abortion but now is hesitating, the author might feel conflicted. However, her decision to proceed or not is still hers. So, the author is not in the wrong for wanting her to get an abortion if she was the one who initially said she would, but her hesitation complicates things. \n\nWait, the author says she told him she would get an abortion if she ever got pregnant. Now she's hesitating, so maybe the author is correct in pointing out that she needs to decide. However, if she's changed her mind, he can't force her. \n\nThis is a tough call. The author's main argument is that she's being inconsistent and delaying, leading to a more difficult procedure. But the delay is due to her own process, which might be valid. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy and for pressuring her based on his own stress and financial concerns. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's pressuring his girlfriend to make a decision about her body, especially after she's chosen not to proceed with the abortion now. His frustration and stress don't override her right to make this choice. Additionally, his judgment about her delays and using that to diminish her situation shows a lack of empathy.\n"
