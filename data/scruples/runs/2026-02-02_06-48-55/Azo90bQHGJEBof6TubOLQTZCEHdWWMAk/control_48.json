Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a 22-year-old guy in a relationship with his 23-year-old girlfriend. They found out she's pregnant, and she's deciding whether to have an abortion. The author is asking if he's at fault for telling her to get an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The girl has PCOS and told him she couldn't get pregnant. But now she is pregnant. She also mentioned she would get an abortion if she ever did. The author is concerned about the financial and emotional stress of having a child right now, and he's not ready for that. She delayed the process, which led to needing a surgical abortion instead of a chemical one. She also had a previous pregnancy 10 years ago, which she didn't mention. The author feels she lied about her fertility and hid her past pregnancy.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is advising an abortion because he's not in a position to support a child, the girlfriend had her own reasons for delaying, and there's some deception from her side. The author is upset about her not calling for an immediate appointment, which led to needing a more invasive procedure.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. In many contexts, a person's decision to terminate a pregnancy is their own, and the partner's input can be a sensitive issue. However, if the woman is making her own choice, the partner's insistence might be problematic. But here, the author is stating his reasons, which are valid concerns about their current life situations.\n\nBut there's also the issue of the author feeling that she misused his trust by not being honest about her fertility and past. That adds another layer of complexity. The author's stance seems to be based on practical reasons, but the way he phrases it (like \"kill the baby\") and her use of vulgar language might indicate tension in the relationship.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, in Denmark, abortion is legal, so the decision is legally permissible. The author is not forcing her; he's expressing his opinion. However, if the woman is making her own decision, the partner's pressure might be seen as overstepping. But since the author is sharing his perspective and his reasons, it's more about mutual decision-making. The problem arises if he's pressuring her, but the post seems to indicate that he's telling her his stance, not forcing her.\n\nThe girlfriend's delays and hidden past pregnancy might contribute to the author's frustration. However, the author's main action here is advising an abortion, which he's done without coercion. The real question is whether advising an abortion in this context makes him \"at fault.\" Given that the woman is making the final decision, the author isn't in the wrong for sharing his perspective, especially given their circumstances. However, the situation is complicated by the woman's actions and the author's reaction to them.\n\nIn conclusion, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his position on abortion, especially since he's not forcing her hand and has valid concerns. The girlfriend's behavior (delays, deception) complicates the situation, but the author's advice isn't inherently wrong. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
