Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation involves the author telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. The girlfriend has PCOS and previously said she couldn't get pregnant, but she ended up pregnant. The author is concerned about their ability to support a child financially and emotionally, given their work schedule and her welfare situation. The girlfriend delayed the abortion, leading to a surgical procedure with higher risks. She also mentioned a past pregnancy that she didn't disclose, which the author sees as a red flag.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is the girlfriend's autonomy over her own body and reproductive choices. Even if the author is worried about their future together and the child's well-being, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is ultimately up to the woman. The author is pressuring her to make a choice that affects her physically and emotionally. \n\nThe girlfriend's delays might have been due to her own hesitation or emotional conflict, which is common in such decisions. The author's frustration about the timing and the method of abortion might stem from their own anxieties, but that doesn't justify pressuring her. Additionally, the girlfriend's past pregnancy and PCOS complexities might have influenced her current decision-making, which the author didn't fully understand or support.\n\nThe author's use of \"ITA\" (If That\u2019s Appropriate) suggests they're seeking validation for their actions. However, respecting a partner's reproductive rights and autonomy is crucial. Even if the author didn't want children, the girlfriend's right to make her own decision, especially after her own health considerations, should be paramount. \n\nThe girlfriend's use of vulgar language might have been an expression of her stress or anger rather than a genuine desire to harm. The author's response in telling her to abort could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and autonomy. \n\nWhile the author's concerns about their ability to support a child are valid, the way they approached the situation\u2014by insisting on an abortion rather than discussing the future together\u2014could be seen as wrong. The author might benefit from reflecting on how to support their partner in a healthy relationship rather than making unilateral decisions about her body.\n"
