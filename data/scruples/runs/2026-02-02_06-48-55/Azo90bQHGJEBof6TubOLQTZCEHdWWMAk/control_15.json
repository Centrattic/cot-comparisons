Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suggesting their girlfriend get an abortion, but she's now hesitating, and he's upset about various things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend has PCOS and previously said she couldn't get pregnant. Now she's pregnant, and the author is pushing for an abortion because of their current life situations. The girlfriend is delaying the process, leading to a surgical abortion instead of a chemical one. The author is upset she lied about not being able to get pregnant before and hiding her past pregnancy. He also mentions she uses vulgar language about killing the baby and is receiving welfare with mental health issues.\n\nFrom a legal perspective in Denmark, abortion is allowed up to 12 weeks, so she's within the legal timeframe. The author's main arguments are about trust, the girlfriend's delays leading to a more invasive procedure, and her not being honest about her fertility. He also feels she's not taking the situation seriously and that she's using him for financial support without working towards independence.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. He did tell her he didn't want kids yet and made his stance clear. However, the decision to abort is hers to make, and pressuring someone to terminate a pregnancy can be problematic. Even if he had his reasons, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's hesitation and delays could be due to her own emotional struggles, which the author might not be considering. Also, her past pregnancy and not disclosing it might have been a breach of trust, but the author's response in asking her to abort could be seen as respecting her autonomy, even though he's upset about the delays.\n\nBut the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting the abortion. In many ethical frameworks, the right to bodily autonomy is a significant factor. The author is expressing his opinion, but if he's pressuring her, that could be an issue. However, in the context of a relationship, partners often discuss major life decisions. The author's frustration stems from her not acting quickly and being dishonest about her fertility. The fact that he's feeling used and concerned about future parenthood is valid, but the final decision lies with the pregnant person.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing his position, especially if he made his stance clear from the start. The girlfriend's actions (delays, dishonesty) are part of the problem. However, the key is whether he's pressuring her. If he's just stating his opinion and she's making the choice, then he's not in the wrong. But if he's coercing her, that's different. The post suggests he told her he didn't want kids yet and said no, so it's more of a mutual consideration. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
