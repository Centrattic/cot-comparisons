Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to unpack this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple where the girlfriend is pregnant and the boyfriend is advising her to get an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The boyfriend says they've known each other for about a year, and the girlfriend had told him she couldn't get pregnant due to PCOS. However, she ended up pregnant. He's pushing for an abortion based on various reasons like his work schedule, financial concerns, and her current situation (welfare, mental health). The girlfriend is hesitant, slow in the process, and she ended up needing a surgical abortion because she delayed. She also revealed a past pregnancy she didn't mention before. The boyfriend is upset about being misled and feels the abortion is necessary.\n\nNow, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's look at the factors. In many places, including Denmark, abortion is legal, and the decision is typically up to the pregnant person. The boyfriend is pressuring her to have an abortion, which could be a point of contention. Even if he has valid concerns, the ultimate decision should rest with the woman, especially in a medical procedure that affects her body. \n\nThe girlfriend's hesitation and slow process might be due to emotional or psychological reasons. The boyfriend's frustration seems to stem from her delay leading to a more invasive procedure. However, he's also criticized her for not acting faster, which could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. \n\nAnother point is the girlfriend's history: she had a pregnancy before and didn't disclose it. The boyfriend feels misled because she claimed infertility. This could affect trust, but it's possible she didn't consider it relevant at the time. \n\nIn terms of rights, the boyfriend isn't the one carrying the pregnancy, so his input is important in the relationship dynamics, but he shouldn't override her autonomy. The fact that he's pressuring her to abort, using arguments about her ability to handle motherhood, might be seen as controlling. \n\nThe use of vulgar language by the girlfriend (\"kill the baby\") might indicate her own distress, but that doesn't justify the boyfriend's role in the decision-making. The key issue is who holds the right to make this medical choice. Since the woman has the legal right to make this decision, the boyfriend's insistence could be seen as overstepping. \n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend is not in the same position as the pregnant person; he's not the one facing the physical and emotional consequences. His concerns about future plans are valid, but they shouldn't dictate her medical choices. \n\nThe girlfriend's hesitation and delay could be due to her own internal conflict, and the boyfriend's reaction might be dismissive of her emotional state. It's possible he's not fully respecting her autonomy. \n\nIn summary, while the boyfriend has his own reasons, the ultimate decision lies with the pregnant woman. Pressuring her to abort, especially with the implication that her delay led to a worse outcome, could be seen as the boyfriend overstepping. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy and for contributing to the pressure rather than supporting her decision.\n"
