Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the couple is in a relatively new relationship, having started in August. The girlfriend has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. But now she's pregnant. The author is 22, and she's 23. They're in Europe, Denmark, where abortion is legal up to 12 weeks. The girlfriend is at 8 weeks, which means a surgical abortion is needed. The author is questioning her about her readiness for a child, citing their current life situations\u2014she's on welfare, has mental health issues, and he's stressed with work. She's been hesitant to proceed with the abortion, delayed the process, and now even after being offered a consultation with him, she didn't reschedule. Also, she had a previous pregnancy she didn't mention, which adds to the author's distrust.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author might be in the wrong, but they're unsure. The key points to consider are consent, trust, and the ethical implications of the author's actions. \n\nThe author is pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion. Even if he has valid reasons about their life circumstances, the decision about pregnancy is typically seen as the woman's right. The author's comments about her not being ready, questioning her ability to carry a pregnancy (since she claims PCOS made it impossible before), and using her delays against her might be seen as controlling. \n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's actions\u2014being slow in the process, using vulgar language, and hiding her past pregnancy\u2014could be reasons the author feels wronged. But from her perspective, she might have been struggling with the decision, which is a personal and complex choice. The author's insistence that she must abort could be seen as respecting her autonomy, but also as being dismissive of her feelings and the medical complexities.\n\nIn terms of the law and ethics, while the author is within his rights to express his opinion, the final decision should lie with the woman. The fact that he's making her feel pressured might not be the right approach, even if he believes it's for the best. Also, the girlfriend's delays might have been due to personal struggles rather than negligence, so the author's frustration might not consider her emotional state.\n\nSo, the author is putting his partner in a position where she must comply with his wishes, which could be seen as violating her autonomy. Even though she delayed, the decision isn't solely his. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for pressuring her and not respecting her agency in this matter.\n"
