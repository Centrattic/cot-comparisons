Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a 22-year-old who got his girlfriend pregnant. His girlfriend is 23. They've been dating since August. The girlfriend had PCOS and told him she couldn't get pregnant. She also said if she did get pregnant, she'd get an abortion. Now she's pregnant, and they're dealing with the decision.\n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. Let's look at the key points from the story. The girlfriend was slow in the process: she forgot to buy a test for days, missed a doctor's appointment, and didn't get an immediate appointment when she could have. The author mentions that in Denmark, you can get immediate appointments, so she didn't have a good reason. He's also concerned about the stress of parenthood, their current financial situations, and her mental health. She uses vulgar language about abortion, like \"kill the baby,\" and then changed her mind about the abortion. There's also a red flag because she had a pregnancy before and now claims she can't get pregnant, but no doctor confirmed that.\n\nThe author feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her ability to get pregnant and her past pregnancy. He also thinks she's responsible for the delay causing the need for a surgical abortion instead of a medical one, which could affect her future fertility. The author is stressed about the potential impact on his life and his ability to support a child right now.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for advocating for an abortion. In many places, including Denmark, abortion is legal, so the decision is legally permissible. However, the ethical angle here depends on personal responsibility and consent.\n\nThe girlfriend took her time in confirming the pregnancy and seeking medical attention, which might have been her choice. She might have been dealing with her own mental health issues and uncertainty. The author mentions she has mental health problems and relies on welfare, which could affect her decision-making. However, she did express her intention to abort if she got pregnant, so maybe her hesitation now is conflicting with her previous stance.\n\nThe author is pressuring her, but in a long-term relationship, both partners have a right to discuss and agree on such life decisions. However, the girlfriend's actions, like delaying the process and changing her mind, might have caused the current situation. The author's frustration comes from feeling she's not taking responsibility for the situation, leading to a more complicated procedure.\n\nAnother angle is the author's use of the phrase \"kill the baby,\" which is a strong and possibly hurtful way to refer to an abortion. That could be impacting the girlfriend's emotional state. The author also brought up her past pregnancy, which she had hidden, leading to a breach of trust. However, the author is also using her actions (delays, previous pregnancy) as reasons for his stance.\n\nThe author's main argument is about responsibility and future plans. He's worried about financial stability, his job, and their current living situations. He's not being selfish per se, but he's realistic about their circumstances. However, the girlfriend's mental health and financial support from him are factors that might affect her ability to handle parenthood.\n\nIn terms of ethics, both parties have the right to their own decisions, but in a relationship, mutual consent and support are crucial. The author is pressuring her to make a decision that she's now hesitant about, which could lead to further conflict. The girlfriend's initial hesitation and delays might have been due to her own processing of the situation, which is understandable given the emotional weight of an abortion.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by pushing for an abortion. If the girlfriend changed her mind about the abortion, the author's insistence might be disregarding her current feelings. On the other hand, he had previously stated his stance, and she had agreed. Now her inconsistency might be causing the conflict.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions stem from a place of concern for their future and her well-being, but pressing her to proceed with an abortion despite her hesitation could be seen as overstepping. The girlfriend's delays and hidden past pregnancy also contribute to the situation. It's a complex interplay of personal responsibility, communication, and mutual respect. The author isn't entirely in the wrong, but he might be overreacting to her actions without considering her emotional state. However, given the circumstances described, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because both parties have valid concerns, but the girlfriend's actions complicated the situation.\n"
