Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the Reddit post) is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation is quite complex, so I need to consider several factors here.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has PCOS and was told she might not get pregnant. The author mentions she's been clear about her stance on abortion from the start of the relationship. Now that she's pregnant, she's taking a long time to get the abortion done, leading to a surgical procedure instead of a chemical one. The author is concerned about their ability to support a child financially and emotionally, and the girlfriend's lifestyle, including welfare and mental health issues.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and autonomy. The girlfriend chose not to have the abortion immediately when given the option at the gynecologist. The author is pressuring her to proceed with the abortion, possibly because of the surgical risks mentioned. However, the girlfriend's hesitation might stem from conflicting emotions or fear about the procedure and future fertility.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable given their initial beliefs and the girlfriend's delays. But ultimately, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is a personal one that involves the individual's health, beliefs, and circumstances. The author has the right to express their opinion, but they can't force the girlfriend to make a decision against her will. The girlfriend's delays might be due to emotional conflict rather than negligence, which the author might not be considering.\n\nAlso, the revelation that she was pregnant before complicates things. However, that doesn't necessarily mean she's lying about her fertility. The author might be overstepping by not respecting her autonomy in the decision-making process, even if they disagree with her choices. The use of strong language like \"kill the baby\" could also be a red flag, but the author's role is to support, not dictate, her medical decisions.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, the girlfriend has the right to make decisions about her body. The author's insistence on an abortion, especially after she's decided to proceed, could be seen as controlling. The delays in the process might be due to factors the author isn't accounting for, like fear or emotional trauma.\n\nSo, while the author has valid concerns, they're not in the wrong in the sense of legally or ethically forcing the girlfriend to abort. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong for advising her. Since both are in a relationship and making a joint decision, the author's input is part of the conversation. But respecting her autonomy is crucial. The answer leaning towards \"B\" (not in the wrong) because the author is advocating for a decision based on their shared future, but there's a fine line between support and control.\n"
