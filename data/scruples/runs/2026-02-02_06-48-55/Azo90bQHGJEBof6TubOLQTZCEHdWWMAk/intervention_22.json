Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple is in a relationship, both young, in Europe, Denmark. The girlfriend has PCOS and claimed she couldn't get pregnant. She also said she would get an abortion if she ever became pregnant. Now she is pregnant, and they're dealing with the decision.\n\nThe author is suggesting she get an abortion. He lists reasons like his busy work schedule, financial stress, her living on welfare, and mental health issues. He's also upset because she didn't act quickly enough, leading to a surgical abortion instead of a chemical one. He's mad she lied about her fertility history and had a past pregnancy hidden from him.\n\nThe girlfriend is hesitant, uses harsh language about abortion, and is now considering not going through with it. She also didn't act promptly, delaying the process. The author feels she's not taking the situation seriously and is exploiting his trust.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the key points here are about the decision-making in a pregnancy. In most cases, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is a personal one, and in Denmark, it's legal up to 12 weeks. The author is pressuring her to make a choice that she's now hesitant about. Even though he has valid concerns, the fact that she's the one carrying the pregnancy means her autonomy is crucial here. \n\nThe author's role here is to support her decision, not to pressure her. By telling her to abort, he's imposing his will on her. Even if he has financial and emotional concerns, the primary decision rests with the woman. His frustration with her delays and her past might be valid points of conflict, but forcing her to abort could be seen as disregarding her autonomy. \n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's behavior\u2014like delaying the process and using harsh language\u2014might indicate her own internal conflict. However, the author's responsibility is to support her in whatever decision she makes, not to dictate it. \n\nSo, while the author's concerns might be understandable, the act of telling her to abort could be seen as overstepping, especially given the personal nature of the decision. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's pressuring her, but some might argue B if they think shared responsibility in a relationship includes such decisions. But in most ethical frameworks, the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is the woman's, so the author's pressure is problematic.\n"
