Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (who is a guy in a relationship) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation is complex, so I need to consider multiple factors.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has PCOS and claims she can't get pregnant. She also mentioned she would abort if she got pregnant. Now that she's pregnant, she's being slow in the process, leading to a surgical abortion. The author is concerned about their financial situation and future plans, which is understandable. But the main issue is whether he's in the wrong for pushing her to abort.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and consent. The article mentions that she didn't want to abort initially but later decided to ask the author. However, she didn't reschedule the appointment and waited until she could consult him. The author's decision to tell her to abort might be seen as imposing his will on her reproductive choices, which is a big issue. Even if he has valid concerns, the final decision about abortion should be hers. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's hesitation and the author's frustration are mutual. But the author's choice to force her to abort, given that it's her body, could be problematic. The article also notes her past pregnancy and possible misinformation about her fertility, which adds context but doesn't necessarily justify his actions.\n\nIn many ethical and legal viewpoints, reproductive rights are a personal matter. The author might have shared his concerns, but making the decision for her crosses a line. So, while there are valid points on both sides, the authority over her body lies with her. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not respecting her autonomy.\n"
