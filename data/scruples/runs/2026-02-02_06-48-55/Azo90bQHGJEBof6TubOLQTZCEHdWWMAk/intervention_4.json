Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is at fault for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and his girlfriend started dating in August. She has PCOS and has been told she can't get pregnant, but now she is pregnant. She's been clear from the start that if she got pregnant, she'd get an abortion. However, when she did get pregnant, she was hesitant. The author is 22, works a lot, and feels they aren't ready for a kid. The girlfriend is on welfare, has mental health issues, and the author supports her financially.\n\nNow, the main points of contention. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. The user thinks he is in the wrong, but we need to evaluate that.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's supporting her financially and emotionally, but he's not ready for a child. He's concerned about their current situations (his job, her welfare) and the risks of surgical abortion. He also discovered she had a pregnancy 10 years ago, which she didn't mention, leading to trust issues. The woman delayed the abortion process, leading to a surgical one, and uses vulgar language when talking about the abortion. The author feels she misused his trust by not disclosing her past pregnancy and the possibility of being able to get pregnant again.\n\nNow, considering ethical and moral aspects. In many societies, the decision to have an abortion is typically up to the pregnant person. The author is pressuring her to have an abortion, even though she was initially against it. However, the girlfriend delayed the process, which made it more complicated. The author is also questioning her reasons for hesitation, like claiming having a baby isn't stressful, which he argues is false.\n\nBut the key here is autonomy. The woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. Even if the author is supportive of abortion in principle, the fact that she was hesitant and he's now pushing her to go through with it might infringe on her autonomy. However, she did ask him if he still wanted her to abort, which implies she values his opinion. But she also didn't reschedule the appointment and waited to consult him, which complicates things.\n\nThe author's argument is that her delays led to a surgical abortion, which has higher risks. But the woman might be struggling with the decision herself, which is common in such situations. The author's frustration comes from feeling that she wasn't honest about her fertility and her past, leading to distrust.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the author agreed from the beginning that she would have an abortion if she became pregnant, but now she's hesitating, perhaps the author is within his rights to express his position. However, it's important to note that the woman is making the final decision. The author's role here is to support her, not dictate her choices. Even if he's not ready for a child, the decision isn't solely his. The use of vulgar language by the woman might indicate her own discomfort with the decision, which the author is reacting to.\n\nAnother angle is the author's trust being broken because she didn't disclose her past pregnancy. But if she genuinely believed she couldn't get pregnant again, maybe her omission was a misunderstanding rather than deceit. Still, withholding that information could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nIn terms of the question of whether the author is in the wrong: if he's pressuring her to have an abortion despite her hesitation, that could be problematic. However, if she initiated the conversation and asked for his opinion, then his input is part of the shared decision-making. The complexity here is that the woman is struggling with the decision, and the author is trying to push her towards a choice that aligns with their current life situations.\n\nBut in terms of ethics, the woman's autonomy is paramount. Even if the author feels the decision is necessary, he can't make that call for her. However, since she involved him in the decision-making process by asking his opinion, perhaps his role is valid. The issue might lie more in the way he's handling the situation rather than the content of his request.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. He's making a decision based on their circumstances and the information he has. However, the way he's approaching it, perhaps with a lack of sensitivity to her hesitation and emotional state, could contribute to problems. But the core issue of whether he's \"in the wrong\" for wanting an abortion in this scenario is more about shared responsibility and communication rather than a clear right or wrong.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the pregnant person's autonomy is the primary concern. So, even if the author has valid reasons, the final decision rests with the woman. If she's hesitating and the author is pressuring her, that could be where the issue lies. However, in this case, she did ask his opinion, so it's a mutual decision. The author's frustration about her delays and lack of honesty might cloud his judgment, but the act of advising her to have an abortion isn't necessarily wrong if it's a mutual decision.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's making a decision based on their circumstances and the woman involved initiated the discussion. However, there's a nuance where the way he's handling it could be improved, but not necessarily making him \"at fault\" in the scenario.\n"
