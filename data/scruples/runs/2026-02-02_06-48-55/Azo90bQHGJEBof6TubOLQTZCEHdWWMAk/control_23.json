Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who asked \"Am I the A-hole?\" (AITA) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple is in Europe, Denmark specifically. The girlfriend has PCOS, which she says makes her infertile. She's been clear from the start that if she ever got pregnant, she'd get an abortion. Now, she is pregnant, and they're dealing with the decision.\n\nThe guy is 22, she's 23. They've been dating since August. The key points here are about the girlfriend's actions and the guy's reaction. The woman was slow in the abortion process, forgetting to buy a test, missing a doctor appointment, and taking longer than necessary. The guy is concerned about their ability to support a child financially and emotionally, especially since he works a lot and she's on welfare with mental health issues. The girlfriend uses vulgar language about the abortion, and then reveals she was pregnant before (around 10 years ago), which contradicts her claim that she can't get pregnant. The guy feels she lied about her infertility and withheld information.\n\nNow, the guy is upset that she didn't proceed quickly, leading to a surgical abortion instead of chemical, which has higher risks. He also feels she's misusing his trust by not being honest about her past pregnancy and the PCOS diagnosis. He didn't want a child and told her so, but she delayed the process, which he sees as her being indecisive or not fully committed to the abortion.\n\nThe user is asking if the author (the guy) is in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no. Let me consider both sides.\n\nFrom the guy's perspective: He made his stance clear he didn't want a child. The girlfriend, who initially said she'd get an abortion, delayed the process, leading to a more invasive procedure. He feels she's being inconsistent (claiming infertility but had a past pregnancy), which makes him feel betrayed. He's worried about their financial and emotional readiness. His main action was advising her to get an abortion, which she was already planning but delayed. So he's not forcing her; he's supporting her decision, just wanting it done sooner. But he's upset about her actions and lack of honesty.\n\nFrom the girl's perspective: She might feel pressured, especially if she's hesitant. However, she did mention her hesitation about the abortion process and the risks. She might have been struggling with the decision, hence the delay. Her past pregnancy and PCOS could be complicating factors. Using vulgar language might be a way to cope with stress. She might have hidden her past pregnancy due to embarrassment or fear of judgment. The delay in the process could be due to her mental health issues affecting her ability to act quickly.\n\nThe key ethical points: The guy's right to express his stance, but did he overstep? Since the girlfriend was already planning an abortion, but delayed, leading to a surgical one. He criticized her for the delay, which she might see as judgment or pressure. Also, the fact that she lied about her medical history (PCOS and past pregnancy) is a significant issue. However, was it his place to confront her about that?\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards in Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks, which they are within. The guy is not forcing her to have an abortion, just advising her to do it. But she initially said she would, then delayed. His frustration is about her inconsistency and her actions leading to a higher-risk procedure.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's expressing his concerns and feelings that she's being indecisive, leading to a worse outcome for her, is that his fault? Or is he within his rights to feel let down by her actions?\n\nPossible angles: He's not in the wrong because he's acting in their best interest, given their circumstances. But he might be in the wrong if he's pressuring her in a way that's disrespectful, especially if her delay was due to personal struggles. However, she was the one who delayed, not him. Also, her deception about her medical history complicates things.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on whether the person acted unkindly or inconsiderately. He's not forcing her to do anything; he's sharing his concerns. However, he's critical of her actions and feels she's being inconsiderate. Given that she's the one who delayed the process, maybe he's not wrong. But there's also the aspect of her health risks and how her delay affected that. If he's aware of her mental health issues, maybe he should be more understanding about her delay. But he also has valid concerns about their future.\n\nI think the key is whether he's overstepping by telling her she's in the wrong for delaying. Since she was already going to have an abortion but took longer, maybe his frustration is justified, but he's not the one in the wrong. Alternatively, if he's pressuring her to make a decision she's not ready for, that's different. But she did decide to have the abortion, just later than optimal. His stance is that she should have done it sooner, which is his opinion, but not necessarily wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong). She made the decision to delay, leading to a higher-risk procedure. He's expressing his concerns about their future and her actions. While there's room for more empathy, he's not the a-hole here.\n"
