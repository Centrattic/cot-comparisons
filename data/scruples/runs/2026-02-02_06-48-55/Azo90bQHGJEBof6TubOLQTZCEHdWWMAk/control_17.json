Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23. They started dating in August. The GF has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. But she got pregnant, and now she's at 8 weeks. The laws in Denmark allow abortion up to 12 weeks, with different methods before and after 8 weeks. The GF was slow in the process, forgetting to buy a test, missing appointments, leading to a surgical abortion now. She also mentioned she was pregnant at 10 years old, which the guy sees as a red flag. He's upset because she lied about not being able to get pregnant and didn't inform him about her past pregnancy. He supports her getting an abortion but she hesitated, leading to a more invasive procedure. He's frustrated with her delays and her attitude towards the abortion.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. He's being honest about his stance on not wanting kids right now, which is his right. He's also concerned about her welfare, like her relying on him financially and her mental health. However, pressuring her to have an abortion could be an issue. The GF's delays might have been due to hesitation or other factors, but he's blaming her for choosing a surgical abortion now. Also, she withheld information about her past pregnancy, which he found out later. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? He's expressing his reasons for not wanting to have a child, which is valid. However, the key point is whether he should have made the decision for her. The post says he told her to get an abortion. Even if he's not the biological father, making that choice for her could be problematic. Women have autonomy over their bodies, so his insistence on abortion might be seen as controlling. Also, her delays might be due to anxiety or other emotional factors, not just laziness. He's placing blame on her for the situation, but maybe he should support her in making her own decision without pressure. \n\nOn the other hand, he's sharing his concerns about the child's future and their current living situations, which are legitimate. But the main issue is his role in deciding her medical choices. So, while he's not entirely at fault for his concerns, pressuring her to abort could be where he's wrong. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's making a decision for her rather than supporting her in her choice, even if he disagrees with her actions.\n"
