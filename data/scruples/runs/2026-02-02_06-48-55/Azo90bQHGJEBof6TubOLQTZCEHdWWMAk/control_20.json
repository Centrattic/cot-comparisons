Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for suggesting his girlfriend get an abortion. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has PCOS and has always said she can't get pregnant, but it turns out she can. She also had a past pregnancy that she didn't mention. The author is concerned about their ability to support a child, given her welfare status, mental health issues, and his own work commitments. He argues she delayed the abortion process, leading to a surgical procedure with potential risks affecting her future fertility. She also used harsh language about the pregnancy.\n\nThe key points here are consent, honesty, and the pressure to terminate. The author is advising her on a decision that's ultimately hers, involving her body and future. Even if she delayed, he's suggesting she abort, which could be seen as controlling. There's also the issue of her not disclosing her past pregnancy, which the author sees as a betrayal of trust. However, the author's right to make that decision might be questionable because reproductive choices are personal. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, a person's autonomy over their body is paramount. Even if the author has valid concerns about their readiness for parenthood, the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is the woman's. Pressuring her could be seen as wrong, regardless of the circumstances. The girlfriend's hesitation might stem from her own fears and uncertainties, which the author is dismissing by focusing on her delays. \n\nAlso, the fact that she changed her mind about the abortion, possibly due to the author's influence, adds another layer. The author's role in her decision-making process might have crossed a line, especially if he's not supportive of her actual feelings towards the pregnancy. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy and possibly pressuring her into a decision. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
