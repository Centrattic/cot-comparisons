Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong for advising their girlfriend to get an abortion. The answer choices are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points from the scenario are:\n\n1. The girlfriend (GF) has PCOS and claimed she couldn't get pregnant, but it turns out she was pregnant before. She was told by a doctor that her PCOS might have started after her previous pregnancy, but no doctor officially said she couldn't conceive now.\n2. The GF is hesitant about getting an abortion, leading to delays in the process. She ended up needing a surgical abortion because of the delay.\n3. The GF uses strong language, like \"kill the baby,\" which might indicate she's not comfortable with the decision.\n4. The OP is concerned about their financial and emotional capacity as a parent. They work 24/7, and the GF is on welfare with mental health issues.\n5. The GF didn't reschedule the appointment immediately after the initial one, leading to the need for a more invasive procedure.\n6. The GF told the doctor to ask the OP if he still wanted her to abort, instead of contacting him directly.\n7. The OP feels the GF lied about her fertility and used his trust, and he's not at all ready to be a parent.\n\nNow, the question is whether the OP is in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. \n\nFirst, in terms of legality and ethics: In Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks, and the method depends on the gestational age. The GF was at 8 weeks, so a chemical abortion would have been available. However, due to her delays, it's now surgical. That part is factual.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the OP is advising her to have an abortion. The GF is the one who has the right to make decisions about her own body. Even though the OP is involved, the final decision should rest with the pregnant person. However, the GF seems conflicted and is delaying the process, which the OP is upset about. \n\nThe GF's behavior is questionable. She claimed she couldn't get pregnant (but actually can), didn't act promptly when she found out, and used harsh language. The OP's frustration is understandable, but does that make him in the wrong? \n\nThe main issue here is that the OP is pressuring the GF to make a decision that she's not fully committed to. Even if he's not ready to be a parent, he has a right to express his feelings. However, the GF has the right to make her own decision. The fact that she delayed the process might be her way of seeking support or trying to see if he changes his mind. \n\nThe OP's actions (telling her to abort) aren't illegal, but ethically, it's a gray area. If the GF is the one who ultimately decides to proceed, even if he advised her, it's her choice. However, the way he frames his \"telling her\" could be seen as pressuring her, especially if her hesitation is due to confusion or seeking reassurance. \n\nIn terms of responsibility: The OP didn't force her; he stated his reasons clearly. The GF made the final decision to go through with the abortion after consulting him. So, he might not be in the wrong in terms of giving his opinion. However, there's the aspect of trust issues (her lying about being infertile and her past pregnancy) which complicates the relationship dynamics. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the act of telling her to get an abortion. In most ethical frameworks, the pregnant person has the right to decide. The OP's advice is his opinion, but he isn't making the decision for her. However, the way he frames his argument (e.g., \"she needs the surgical procedure\" and \"don't feel bad for her\") might indicate a lack of empathy towards her, which is a red flag. \n\nIn conclusion, while the GF's actions are problematic, the OP's decision to advise an abortion isn't necessarily wrong, especially if he's honest about his reasons. However, the situation is complex, and the answer might depend on cultural and personal beliefs. But based on the information, the OP is not in the wrong for expressing his stance, given the circumstances. So the answer should be B.\n"
