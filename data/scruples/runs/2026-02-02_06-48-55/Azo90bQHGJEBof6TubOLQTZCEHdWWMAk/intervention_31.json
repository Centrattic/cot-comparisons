Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong. The scenario involves the OP advising their girlfriend to get an abortion because of various reasons like his work schedule, financial situation, and her welfare dependency. The girlfriend, in turn, is described as being hesitant, using vulgar language, and hiding past pregnancy, which OP now sees as a red flag.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The OP is pressuring his girlfriend to abort the pregnancy. They are both young, in their early 20s, and in a relationship that started in August. The girlfriend has PCOS and previously stated she can't get pregnant, but OP now discovers she was pregnant before. She's delaying the abortion process, leading to the need for a surgical one, which carries the risk of future infertility. OP's arguments for abortion include his inability to support a child due to work and financial constraints, and the girlfriend's mental health and welfare status.\n\nThe key here is whether pressuring someone to abort a pregnancy is wrong. In many contexts, especially where the woman has autonomy over her body, the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is hers. The OP is exerting his influence, possibly against her wishes. Even if he has financial and life concerns, the decision shouldn't be forced. The girlfriend's hesitation might stem from her own feelings about the situation, and OP's reaction seems dismissive of her autonomy. Also, her past pregnancy and PCOS history raise questions about the accuracy of her previous statements, but that doesn't negate her right to make this choice.\n\nThe legal aspect in Denmark allows for abortion up to 12 weeks, so she's within her rights. The fact that she delayed might be due to personal reasons, not just negligence, and OP's judgment about her pace could be unfair. The use of vulgar language by her is concerning, but that's her way of expressing distress or conflict. The OP's focus on his own ability to support a child might overlook her agency and the broader implications of forcing an abortion.\n\nIn terms of ethics, autonomy is a major factor. Even if the OP is concerned about their future, pressuring her to terminate against her wishes could be seen as violating her rights. The fact that she sought his input but then he dismissed her and took the stance to tell her to abort suggests a lack of mutual respect. The answer likely leans towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's imposing his decision on her, rather than supporting her choice regardless of his personal reservations.\n"
