Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to unpack this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation is complicated, so I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has a history of PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. But then she becomes pregnant. The guy found out and suggested an abortion. Now, the girlfriend is delaying the process, leading to a surgical abortion which has higher risks of infertility. The guy is frustrated because she's been slow, uses harsh language about the abortion, and lied about her pregnancy history. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions seem to be a key point. She claimed she couldn't get pregnant, which wasn't confirmed by a doctor. She also had a past pregnancy, which she didn't disclose. Her delays in getting the abortion (like forgetting tests, missing appointments) caused the need for a surgical procedure. She also questioned the guy's reasons for wanting the abortion, which he provided\u2014work stress, financial instability, her welfare status, and mental health issues. \n\nThe guy is upset because he feels she misused his trust. The girlfriend's hesitation and delays led to a more complicated procedure. The guy's main argument is that she wasn't proactive, which made the situation worse. But the user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe that's not the case.\n\nNow, considering ethical and moral aspects. The guy has the right to voice his opinion, but pressuring someone into an abortion can be problematic. However, the girlfriend's behavior seems to have contributed to the problem. She wasn't following through on the steps she was planning to take if she got pregnant. The guy's reasons for not wanting the child are valid given their current situations. \n\nThe girlfriend's use of vulgar language and her hesitation might indicate her own internal conflict. She might not want the abortion but is conflicted, leading to delays. The guy's frustration is understandable. But is he in the wrong? If they had discussed these issues earlier, maybe the situation could have been avoided. However, the girlfriend's actions (lying about her history, delaying the process) contributed to the current problem. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some blame. The guy is expressing his stance, which is his right, but the girlfriend's actions led to complications. The key here is whether the guy is in the wrong for suggesting the abortion. Since he's clear that he doesn't want a child now and provided valid reasons, it's more about the girlfriend's responsibility in handling the situation. The guy might not be in the wrong here, especially since the girlfriend wasn't taking the necessary steps promptly. The fact that she delayed and then changed her mind about the abortion might mean the guy isn't at fault. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong). He's expressing his position, and the girlfriend's actions led to the situation. However, there's a nuance here. If he's pressuring her to make a decision she's not comfortable with, that's different. But given the details, she was the one who delayed the process, leading to the need for a surgical abortion. His frustration is about her not following through on her own stated plans. So, the author isn't in the wrong; the blame lies more with the girlfriend's actions.\n"
