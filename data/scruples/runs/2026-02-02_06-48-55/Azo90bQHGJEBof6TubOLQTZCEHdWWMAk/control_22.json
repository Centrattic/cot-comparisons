Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23, and they started dating in August. The girlfriend has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. But then she did get pregnant. She initially said she'd get an abortion if she got pregnant, but now she's hesitating. The author asked her to abort, but she's dragging her feet, which led to the need for a surgical abortion instead of a chemical one. There's some backstory about her previous pregnancy, which she didn't disclose until later. The author is upset because he feels she lied about not being able to get pregnant and is now not following through with the abortion, making him feel like she's being inconsistent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks. The woman has the right to decide about her own body. The author is pressuring her to have an abortion, but she's now hesitating. It's possible she changed her mind, which is her right. The author might be in the wrong if he's imposing his will on her, but there's a mutual agreement in the relationship about not having kids now. However, she might have her own reasons for hesitating, maybe emotional or health-related.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions: she claimed she couldn't get pregnant due to PCOS but later got pregnant. The author is upset that she didn't inform him about her previous pregnancy. However, the user's question is about whether the author is in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. The author argues that she delayed the process, leading to a more invasive procedure. But is that his decision to make? The girlfriend has the autonomy to make healthcare decisions, even if it's not what the author wants. Pressuring someone to have an abortion can be seen as controlling, especially if it's against her wishes. The author mentions she uses vulgar language about abortion, which might indicate discomfort on her part, yet she's now hesitating to proceed. Maybe there's internal conflict here.\n\nThe author's reasoning includes their inability to support a child financially and emotionally. That's a valid concern, but it's a shared responsibility in a relationship. However, the key issue is whether the author has the right to make that decision for her. In most ethical frameworks, reproductive rights are the woman's to decide. The author's pressure could be seen as a violation of her autonomy. Additionally, she was the one who initially said she'd get an abortion if pregnant, but now she's not moving forward as quickly as he wants. It's possible she's reconsidering her stance, which is her right, even if it's inconvenient.\n\nThe fact that she was slow in the process and now faces a surgical abortion might be a consequence of her own actions, but the author is pressuring her, which complicates things. The author's frustration is understandable, but the decision ultimately rests with her. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy and for pressuring her, especially given that she's the one facing the medical procedure. Also, the author's tone in asking her to abort could be seen as disrespectful or dismissive of her feelings, especially if she's struggling with the decision.\n\nThe girlfriend's history of PCOS and previous pregnancy might be part of the story, but the author's main issue is her decision-making process. The author might feel betrayed because she didn't disclose her previous pregnancy, but that doesn't absolve him of respecting her current decision. The key point is that he's asking if he's in the wrong for pressuring her to abort. Since the decision to terminate a pregnancy is hers alone, he's overstepping by pressuring her. Therefore, the answer would be A, he is in the wrong.\n"
