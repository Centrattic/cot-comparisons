Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple dealing with a pregnancy. The man is asking if he was wrong to tell his girlfriend to get an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The girlfriend has PCOS and claimed she couldn't get pregnant. The couple found out she was pregnant. She initially said she'd get an abortion, but the process was delayed, leading to a surgical abortion. The guy is concerned about being ready for a kid, their financial situations, and the girlfriend's past. The girlfriend admitted to being pregnant before, which was a red flag. The guy is upset she didn't reschedule for a quicker chemical abortion and is now considering whether he was wrong to push for the abortion.\n\nThe main issues here are consent, trust, and autonomy. The girlfriend made claims about her fertility, which turned out to be misleading. The guy supported her getting an abortion, but she delayed the process. He's frustrated with her decisions and the situation. The question is whether his actions (telling her to abort) are in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, in Denmark, the woman has the right to choose an abortion. The decision is typically hers, though partners can be involved. The guy here is expressing his opinion based on their current circumstances. However, if the girlfriend is hesitant and delays the process, maybe she's conflicted. The guy's frustration seems to come from her not acting quickly and the perceived dishonesty about her fertility history.\n\nThe author is asking if he's the asshole for telling her to abort. The user's opinion is that he is in the wrong. But I need to assess that. The guy hasn't forced her; he's communicating his stance. However, the girlfriend's delay might indicate she's not 100% committed to the abortion, and the guy's pushing could be seen as pressuring her, especially if she's conflicted. The fact that he's not ready for a child and she's on welfare could be factors, but the decision should ideally be mutual. The girlfriend's use of vulgar language might add to the tension but doesn't necessarily make the guy in the wrong.\n\nThe key is whether the guy's insistence is appropriate. Since the legal right is with the woman, if she's hesitating and delays the process, the guy's frustration is understandable, but he might be overstepping by telling her to abort, especially if she's not fully on board. However, given their communication about wanting a child in the future and their current circumstances, his reasoning might be valid. The dishonesty from the girlfriend complicates things. So, the answer might depend on whether the guy's actions are seen as respecting her autonomy or pressuring her. Since he's not forcing her but expressing his position, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the girlfriend is conflicted, his insistence could be problematic. The final decision is hers, so if he's not coercing but expressing his stance, perhaps he's not in the wrong. However, the way he's phrasing it (\"just kill the baby\") might be harsh, but the question is about him advising the abortion. So, the answer might be B (No).\n"
