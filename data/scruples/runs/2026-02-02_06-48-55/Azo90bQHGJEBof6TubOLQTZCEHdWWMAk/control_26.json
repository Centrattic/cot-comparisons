Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation is pretty detailed, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the guy (22) and his girlfriend (23) are European, specifically in Denmark. They started dating in August, and she told him she has PCOS and can't get pregnant. She also said that if she ever got pregnant, she'd just get an abortion. Now, two weeks ago, she found out she's pregnant and is at 8 weeks, meaning a surgical abortion is needed. \n\nShe delayed getting help\u2014forgot to buy a test, slept through the day she should have seen the doctor, and waited for a later appointment. The guy gives reasons why they can't have a kid: he works a lot, she's on welfare, mental health issues, etc. She keeps saying having a baby isn't stressful, which he disputes. She uses vulgar language about killing the baby. She also reveals she was pregnant 10 years ago, which he sees as a red flag because she claimed PCOS came after a pregnancy but no doctor confirmed she can't get pregnant now. She didn't reschedule her appointment and wanted to talk to him about the abortion decision. He feels she lied about her fertility and delayed the process, leading to the need for surgery with potential infertility risks. He doesn't feel bad for her because she could've acted faster.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. \n\n1. **Her fertility claims**: She told him she couldn't get pregnant due to PCOS, but now she is. He's upset she didn't confirm this with a doctor. However, PCOS can be a risk factor but doesn't always prevent pregnancy. She might have overstated her inability, possibly leading him to believe she was infertile. If she knew she could get pregnant but didn't correct him, that's a misrepresentation.\n\n2. **Contraception and responsibility**: Did they use any contraception? The post doesn't mention this. If they didn't, both share responsibility. But since she had PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant, maybe she relied on that. However, if she's been pregnant before, maybe she knew it was possible.\n\n3. **His decision to push for abortion**: He's pressuring her to abort, citing inability to support a child. But the decision is hers, as the pregnant person. In many places, including Denmark, the choice is hers. His influence here could be problematic, especially if he's pressuring her. However, if they're in a relationship, discussing the implications is part of it. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for suggesting an abortion. Legally, he has no say in the procedure itself, but emotionally, if he's pressuring her, that's a factor.\n\n4. **Her delays and the surgical abortion**: She delayed the process, leading to a surgical abortion. He feels she's being slow, but she might have been hesitant. Her hesitation could stem from mental health issues or pressure from him. If he's making her feel guilty for taking time, that's an issue. But if she's genuinely conflicted, her delays aren't entirely his fault. However, he points out that in Denmark, getting an immediate appointment is possible and free, so her delays are her choice.\n\n5. **Her past pregnancy**: She had a pregnancy 10 years ago, which the guy sees as a lie. If she said PCOS came after that pregnancy but no doctor confirmed it, maybe she misrepresented her medical history. That's a breach of trust, as she knew she could get pregnant but claimed otherwise. This could be a significant factor in the trust issue he feels.\n\n6. **Communication**: He says he never wanted a kid yet and told her explicitly. She might have thought they were on the same page. Now, she's confused because he's pushing for abortion. If he had doubts, maybe he should have addressed them more directly instead of expecting her to handle it alone. But he's also within his rights to express his concerns.\n\n7. **Emotional impact**: He feels she misused his trust. This is a common sentiment in such situations. The emotional toll on both parties is significant. His response is to question her decisions and feel she's being irresponsible, but his approach (pressuring her for an abortion) might not consider her autonomy.\n\n8. **Autonomy and decision-making**: The woman has the right to make decisions about her body. If he's pressuring her to have an abortion, even if he's sharing his reasons, it's important that she's making the choice without coercion. If she's being manipulated into an abortion she's not ready for, that's a problem. Conversely, if she's making a decision despite his concerns, her autonomy is key. The fact that she initially said she'd have an abortion if pregnant but now is hesitant suggests internal conflict, not clear consent.\n\nPutting this together, the guy's actions depend on context. If he's pressuring her for an abortion, he's undermining her autonomy. However, his concerns about their inability to support a child are valid. The key issue here is whether he's in the wrong for suggesting the abortion. Since the decision is hers, his role is to support her decision, not dictate it. If he's using guilt or pressure to influence her, that's problematic. However, expressing his stance is part of the relationship. The bigger issue might be her misrepresentation of her fertility and delays, but he's not the one in the wrong for wanting an abortion; the ethical question is whether he's pressuring her. \n\nAlso, the fact that she delayed the process and now faces a surgical abortion with potential infertility risks could be due to her own decisions. But if he's blaming her for that, it's a judgment of her actions. The situation is complex, but the core issue is the autonomy in decision-making. Since the woman has the final say, the guy's role is to support her choice. If he's pressuring her, he's in the wrong. If he's just expressing his concerns and not forcing her, then it's her choice. However, the way he's written the post suggests he's not feeling bad for her and is justifying his stance, which could indicate a lack of empathy towards her situation. \n\nIn terms of the law and ethics, the woman has the right to choose. The man's opinion is part of the discussion but shouldn't override her choice. If he's pressuring her, that's an issue. The fact that she's been hesitant and now changed her mind (from abortion to possibly not) might indicate she's conflicted, and his pressure could be exacerbating that. Given that, the answer would depend on whether he's allowing her to make an autonomous decision. If he's not, then he's in the wrong. But the post doesn't clearly state that he's forcing her; he's just telling her to get an abortion. However, in many contexts, pressuring a partner to abort is considered wrong, even if the decision is hers. So, considering all that, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong (A), but the analysis is nuanced.\n"
