Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an opinion on a Reddit-style AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario. The main issue is the man suggesting his girlfriend get an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple is in Europe, Denmark specifically. The girlfriend has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. She had been upfront about her stance on abortion, saying she'd get one if she ever got pregnant. Now, she's pregnant, but there are delays in getting the abortion. The man is pressuring her, pointing out her delays and the possible risks of the surgical abortion. The girlfriend is hesitating, using strong language, and there's some hidden history\u2014she was pregnant before and lied about not being able to get pregnant. The man is frustrated, feeling her delays forced a surgical abortion, which has higher risks.\n\nSo the question is, is the man in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion? The user thinks the author is in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. In Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks. The woman is 8 weeks in, so she's within the legal window. The man is not the legal parent, so he can't make the medical decision for her. However, he's expressing his opinion, which is his right. But the way he's approaching it\u2014pressuring her, pointing out her delays, and questioning her decisions\u2014might be problematic. \n\nThe woman's autonomy is key here. Even if the man has concerns about being ready for a child, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is ultimately hers. His role is to support her decision, not to push his own. If he's using guilt or pointing out her mistakes to pressure her into an abortion, that could be seen as manipulative. \n\nHowever, there's context: the woman delayed the process, which led to needing a surgical abortion. The man feels she's not taking the situation seriously and is now facing consequences. But even so, the decision is hers. His frustration might be valid, but how he's handling it could be the problem. \n\nAlso, the woman's history of being pregnant before and not disclosing it adds complexity. The man's trust was broken, which is understandable. But that doesn't justify him pressuring her for an abortion. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the man's stance might be seen as respecting her autonomy if he's advocating for her decision she already made (abortion). But if he's forcing her, that's an issue. The woman's delays complicating things might make people question her commitment to the original plan, but the man's response could be seen as harsh. \n\nSo, the man is not the legal parent, can't force the abortion, but he's pressuring her. Depending on the approach, he might be enabling her to make a choice she already intended. However, his criticism about her delays and the method might be seen as undermining her agency. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was harmful or unethical. If the man is pressuring her, it could be unethical. But if he's expressing his opinion in a supportive way, maybe not. The way he's handling it\u2014pointing out her mistakes, using the delays against her\u2014seems more like manipulation. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A, he's in the wrong because he's pressuring her into a medical decision that's hers to make, using guilt and criticism.\n"
