Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple is young, in their early 20s. The girlfriend has PCOS and thought she couldn't get pregnant. She told him that if she ever got pregnant, she'd have an abortion. They found out she's 8 weeks pregnant. The author is pushing for an abortion, but she's been slow in the process, leading to needing a surgical one instead of a chemical. She also revealed she was pregnant 10 years ago, which the author sees as a red flag. He's concerned about their financial situation, her mental health, and their readiness for a child. She's using vulgar language to refer to the abortion, like \"kill the baby,\" which the author finds troubling.\n\nThe author feels she misrepresented her infertility and hid her past pregnancy. He's upset that she didn't reschedule the appointment right away, leading to the need for surgery. He's also concerned about her hesitance and the potential inability to have children in the future if she has the surgical abortion. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The central issue is the author advising the abortion. In many places, including Denmark, abortion is legal, but the decision is personal and often involves both partners. The author is not forcing her, but he's strongly advocating for it. However, the girlfriend has autonomy over her own body. The fact that she was hesitant and slow in the process suggests she might have mixed feelings. The author is pointing out her delays, which could imply that her indecision led to needing a more invasive procedure. But the author's role here is to support her in her decision, not necessarily to push for the abortion. \n\nThere's also the aspect of trust. She told him she couldn't get pregnant, but it turns out she had a past pregnancy and the PCOS diagnosis might not fully prevent pregnancy. This could make the author feel betrayed, but it's unclear if she lied or was mistaken. The author is upset that she didn't reschedule the appointment earlier, which might be a point of contention. However, the decision to have an abortion is hers, and the author might be overstepping by pressuring her. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author is not forcing her, but his insistence on the abortion and his judgment of her for delays could be seen as pressuring her. Also, the way he's framing her as irresponsible for not acting faster might not be fair. The girlfriend's autonomy is a key factor here. Even if the author has valid concerns about their readiness, the final decision lies with her. If he's causing her stress or making her feel guilty for her decisions, that could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is also considering practical aspects like financial stability and their ability to care for a child. He's concerned about their future and might be trying to prevent a situation they can't handle. But he's not the one who has to carry the pregnancy, so his right to make that decision is less clear. \n\nThe author's question is whether he's at fault for advising the abortion. The answer likely hinges on whether he's respecting her autonomy versus pressuring her. If he's supporting her choice but also expressing his concerns, that's different from forcing her. However, in this case, he's clearly advocating for the abortion, which might not be his decision to make. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend and not respecting her autonomy, even if his intentions are to do what he thinks is best. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
