Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who asked for advice (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple is in a relatively new relationship, started in August. The girlfriend has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant, but she ended up becoming pregnant. She had mentioned beforehand that if she got pregnant, she'd just get an abortion. The guy is pressuring her to have the abortion, citing their financial and lifestyle situations. The girlfriend is hesitant, delays the process, and the guy feels she's not taking his concerns seriously. She also hid a past pregnancy and the possibility that her PCOS diagnosis might not be as concrete as she claimed. \n\nNow, the key points here. The woman is making decisions about her body and her reproductive health. The man is involved in the decision-making, which is a personal choice, but ultimately, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is hers. He's expressing his reasons, but if she's the one carrying the child, her autonomy is a major factor. The fact that she delayed the process might be due to personal hesitation, fear, or uncertainty, which is common in such situations. The man's frustration is understandable given their circumstances, but pressuring her could be seen as dismissing her agency. \n\nHe mentions that she used vulgar language to refer to the fetus, which might indicate a lack of respect for her own body or the potential life, but that's subjective. Also, her past pregnancy might be a red flag for the man, but it's her history to deal with. The man is in a position where he's not ready for parenthood and is honest about that. However, the decision to have an abortion is between her and her healthcare provider. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, bodily autonomy is a key principle. Even if the man is concerned, the final decision rests with the woman. By pressuring her to proceed with the abortion, he's asserting control over her reproductive choices, which can be seen as wrong. Additionally, if she's hesitant and he's not offering support to explore all options (like adoption or considering a different lifestyle), that might compound the issue.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, which aligns with the idea that the woman's autonomy is paramount. The fact that she delayed the process could be due to her own emotional conflict, and the man's blame for not acting faster might be unjust. The legal context in Denmark allows for abortion up to 12 weeks, but the method depends on the gestational age. His frustration over the surgical abortion versus the chemical one might be more about convenience than her health, which is a red flag.\n\nIn summary, while the man's concerns about their readiness for parenthood are valid, pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy undermines her autonomy. The answer would likely be that he's not in the wrong (B) in terms of expressing his concerns, but ethically, the decision lies with the woman, and his pressure might be seen as wrong. However, based on the strict question of whether he's in the wrong, the answer may depend on cultural and legal norms. In this case, the author might not be in the wrong if he's advocating for his stance, but the ethical issue is more about her right to decide. Wait, but the question is if he's in the wrong for telling her to abort. The answer might be A, but I need to check again. The key point is that he's pressuring her, which is against her autonomy. So the answer would be A (he is in the wrong) because he's making the decision for her.\n"
