Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who asked about being in the wrong (AITA) is actually at fault. The situation involves the author suggesting their girlfriend get an abortion, and the girlfriend deciding not to go through with it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that the girlfriend had PCOS and thought she couldn't get pregnant, but later it's revealed she was pregnant before. There's a bit of a trust issue here. The author also points out that the girlfriend delayed the abortion process, leading to a surgical procedure instead of a chemical one. The author feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her past pregnancy and her fertility.\n\nThe author's main argument is that he never wanted a child and clearly stated that. He's upset because he believes the girlfriend didn't take the abortion process seriously, leading to complications. He also feels she was dishonest about her medical history.\n\nNow, from an ethical standpoint, the girlfriend has the right to make decisions about her own body. Even though she delayed the process, the decision to proceed with an abortion is hers. The author's pressure to abort could be seen as respecting her autonomy, but the fact that he's pressuring her might be problematic. Also, the girlfriend's hesitation and change of heart after the initial delay could indicate her own internal conflict, which the author might be dismissing.\n\nThe author's tone seems to focus on his own stress and inability to handle a child, which is understandable, but the girlfriend's decision to not abort now might be based on her own reasons. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for suggesting the abortion. In many contexts, supporting a partner's choice to terminate a pregnancy isn't considered wrong, especially if both parties agreed beforehand. However, if the author is pressuring her or making it about his own convenience without respecting her autonomy, that could be an issue.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's delay in the process might be due to personal reasons or fear, which the author is criticizing. This could be a lack of empathy from his side. The fact that she changed her mind after getting more information (like the surgical risk) might show that she's making an informed decision, which the author is now upset about.\n\nIn terms of trust, the girlfriend withheld her past pregnancy, which the author found out later. That's a valid point of betrayal, but the author also knew she couldn't get pregnant initially, which was a lie. However, the main action in question is the author telling her to abort. Legally and ethically, the woman has the right to make that decision, and the author can't force her. If he's pressuring her, that's his choice, but if he's now upset that she's changed her mind, maybe he's at fault for not respecting her autonomy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong for pressuring the abortion and then being upset when she changed her mind. His criticism of her delay and his lack of empathy for her situation could tip the scales. The key here is that the woman has the right to choose, and the author's role is to support her decision, not dictate it. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
