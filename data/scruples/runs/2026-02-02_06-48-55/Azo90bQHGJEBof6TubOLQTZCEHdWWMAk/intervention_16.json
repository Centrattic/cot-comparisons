Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple is in a relationship. The girlfriend has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. She also mentioned that if she ever got pregnant, she would get an abortion. Now they found out she's pregnant. The guy is asking if he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. \n\nThe key points here are consent, autonomy, and the circumstances around the pregnancy. The woman's health history includes PCOS, which can make pregnancy difficult, but there's no official statement from a doctor that she can't get pregnant. She also had a pregnancy 10 years ago, which she didn't disclose. Now she's pregnant again, and the man is pushing for an abortion based on their current life situations\u2014his work, stress, and her welfare status. \n\nHe's concerned about the future, and she's hesitant about the abortion. There's also a delay in her acting on the pregnancy, leading to the need for a surgical procedure instead of a chemical one. The man feels she's misused his trust by not being honest about her past pregnancy and current ability to conceive. \n\nIn terms of rights, the woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. The man might feel he's acting in their best interest, but the decision to have an abortion ultimately lies with the woman. The man's role is supportive, not directive. Even if they discussed future plans, the woman's autonomy is paramount. \n\nThe man's actions could be seen as overstepping because he's pressuring her for an abortion without considering her autonomy. However, the woman's delays might be a red flag, but it's not his place to decide for her. The fact that she didn't reschedule in time and now faces a more invasive procedure could be her responsibility, but the man's insistence on the abortion might still be problematic. \n\nConsidering all factors, the man is not in the wrong because he's expressing his stance based on their circumstances, but the decision is hers. However, if he's pressuring her against her will, that's different. The key is that the woman's choice should be respected. From the description, he's stating his position, which isn't necessarily wrong, but the way he frames it might ignore her autonomy. But since the question is about him being in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion, and given the context, the answer might be B (No), but there's nuance. But in many ethical standards, the woman's right to choose is central, so if he's forcing her, that's A. But he's not forcing, just expressing his opinion. So the answer might be B.\n"
