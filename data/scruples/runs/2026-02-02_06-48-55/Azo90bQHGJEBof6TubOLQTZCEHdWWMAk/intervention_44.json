Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person telling the story) is in the wrong for advising his girlfriend to have an abortion. \n\nFirst, the situation: They started dating in August, and the girlfriend had PCOS and previously said she couldn't get pregnant. She always mentioned she'd get an abortion if she did. Now she's pregnant, and they're dealing with the decision. She delayed the abortion process, leading to a surgical one instead of a chemical one. She also lied about not being pregnant before and about her fertility. The author feels she misused his trust and is upset that she wasn't proactive in the abortion process, leading to a more complicated procedure. He's not ready for a kid and is worried about their financial and life situations.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He relied on her information about her fertility and past. He's not ready for a child and has valid concerns about their current financial and mental health situations. He's frustrated that she delayed the abortion process, making it more complicated. He's also concerned about her honesty regarding her medical history.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's side: She might have felt pressured to abort due to his arguments. Her delays could be due to stress, mental health issues, or fear of the procedure. She might have been conflicted about the decision, especially since she initially said she'd abort but now is hesitating. Her past pregnancy and PCOS history might have affected her current situation in ways she didn't anticipate.\n\nLegally, in Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks. She's at 8 weeks now, so the surgical abortion is within the legal timeframe. The delay might be due to her not prioritizing it quickly enough, possibly due to emotional reasons.\n\nThe key points here are: The author is advising an abortion based on their life circumstances. He's not forcing her but expressing his stance. However, her actions\u2014delaying the process, dishonesty about her medical history\u2014might be contributing to his frustration. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for advising her to abort.\n\nAdvising someone to have an abortion isn't inherently wrong. People have different reasons for making that decision, including financial, emotional, and practical considerations. However, the author might be in the wrong if he's pressuring her to make a decision she's not comfortable with, but the story says she was hesitant and questioned his reasons. Also, she initially said she'd abort but now is hesitating, which complicates things.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable given the circumstances. However, the girlfriend's delays and dishonesty are her own responsibility. The author's advice is based on their mutual life situation. It's a personal decision, but in this case, the author is sharing his perspective and seeking validation.\n\nIn terms of moral wrong, the author isn't forcing her to do anything. He's expressing his position, which is his right. The girlfriend is the one who made the decision to delay the procedure and not act quickly. The author's blame might be misplaced if the delays were due to her own hesitation, not his fault. However, advising someone to have an abortion, especially in the context of their personal plans, isn't inherently wrong. It's a complex situation where both have their own challenges.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. He's making a decision based on their shared circumstances, even if his frustration is justified. The girlfriend's actions led to the situation where a surgical abortion is needed, but the author's advice is still his prerogative. Therefore, the answer would be B for No.\n"
