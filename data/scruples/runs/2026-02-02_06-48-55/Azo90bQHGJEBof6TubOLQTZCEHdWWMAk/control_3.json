Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who posted on Reddit is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe guy is 22, the GF 23, in Europe. They started dating in August. She had PCOS and couldn't get pregnant, but she told him she would just get an abortion if she ever did. Now she's pregnant, 8 weeks along. The laws in Denmark say up to 12 weeks is allowed, with surgical after 8 weeks. She delayed the process by not getting a test quickly, missed a doctor appointment, and got a later slot. She's been hesitant, questioned his reasons for not wanting the child, used vulgar language about killing the baby, and mentioned a past pregnancy that she hadn't told him about. She also said she might become infertile after a surgical abortion. The guy feels she lied about not being able to get pregnant and hid her past pregnancy. He's upset she didn't act faster, leading to needing a surgical abortion.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both partners had agreed upfront that if she got pregnant, she would abort. Now, she's pregnant, but the process was delayed by her actions. She changed her mind after the fact, which complicates things. He's suggesting she misused his trust by not being honest about her past pregnancy and possibly misrepresenting her fertility. \n\nHe's also frustrated that her delays led to a more complicated procedure. He's not in a position to support a child now, given his work and financial situation. She's on welfare, has mental health issues, and relies on him financially. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the man is expressing his stance based on their previous understanding. However, the woman is now hesitating, which might indicate a change of heart. But she's also being inconsistent in her actions. The man feels she took advantage of his trust by not being upfront. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the woman's delay in seeking care led to a surgical abortion. The man is upset because he believes she wasn't proactive. The key here is whether he's in the wrong for advising her to proceed with the abortion as per their prior agreement. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of her changing her mind. In that case, the man's insistence on the abortion despite her hesitation could be a problem. However, he's standing by his initial stance, which was clear from the start. \n\nIt's a complex situation. The woman's behavior\u2014delaying, using vulgar language, and hiding her past pregnancy\u2014could be seen as her being in the wrong. The man, on the other hand, is following through with the decision they discussed. \n\nBut is he wrong for pushing for the abortion now that she's hesitating? If their initial agreement was that she would abort, but she's now unsure, he might be holding her to that agreement, which she might not be able to honor due to her delays. However, he also needs to consider her current feelings and the fact that she's facing the reality of the situation. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) posts, often the key is whether there's a breach of trust or manipulation. The woman's deception (past pregnancy, not being upfront about fertility) and her inconsistent actions could mean she's the one at fault. The man is in a tough spot, but he's not necessarily wrong for sticking to the decision they agreed on, especially since she hasn't communicated her change of heart earlier. However, the way he's handling it\u2014feeling no sympathy because of her delays\u2014might be a bit harsh, but given her actions, it's understandable. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might lean towards B (he's not in the wrong), as he's following through on their initial agreement and she's the one who changed her stance without clear communication. However, there's also the aspect of his support for her, which could be a factor. But given the details provided, the main issues are her deception and delays, making him not in the wrong.\n"
