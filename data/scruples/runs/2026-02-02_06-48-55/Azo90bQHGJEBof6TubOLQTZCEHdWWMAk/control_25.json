Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy is 22, his girlfriend is 23. They've been dating since August. The GF has PCOS and believed she couldn't get pregnant. She mentioned that if she did get pregnant, she'd have an abortion. Now, they found out she's pregnant. The guy told her to get an abortion. There are several points here.\n\nThe GF delayed the process by not getting a test quickly, missed appointments, etc., leading to needing a surgical abortion instead of a chemical one. The guy is concerned about their financial situations, his job stress, and their ability to support a child. The GF is hesitant, uses strong language about the abortion, and revealed she was pregnant 10 years ago, which might have caused her PCOS. The guy feels she lied about being infertile and hid her past pregnancy. The GF didn't reschedule the abortion and now seems to be wavering, leading the guy to feel she's misused his trust and is causing unnecessary stress.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: The guy asked her to have an abortion, which she initially said she would do but then hesitated. He's concerned about their future and their ability to support a child. He's also upset that she didn't act quickly, leading to a more invasive procedure. However, the pregnancy is hers to decide, and he's pressuring her to terminate, which might be problematic. But the context is that they're both young, not ready for parenthood, and she's been indecisive. \n\nIn many places, the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is the woman's, and pressuring her could be seen as controlling. However, the guy provided his reasons based on their circumstances. The GF's behavior\u2014delaying the process, changing her stance, and not being honest about her fertility history\u2014might contribute to his frustration. But the act of asking her to abort could be seen as wrong if it's a form of coercion. However, given their mutual agreement initially that she would abort if pregnant, and her changing stance, the guy might feel justified in advocating for his original position. \n\nThe ethical angle is complex. The guy might be in the right if he's standing by his initial stance, given their prior discussions. However, pressuring her during a time when she's struggling with the decision could be seen as wrong. The GF's delays and lack of action might also contribute to the situation. But the core issue is whether the guy is in the wrong for insisting on an abortion. \n\nConsidering the GF's actions (delays, indecision, past pregnancy), the guy's concerns are understandable. However, the decision ultimately rests with her. So, is he in the wrong for telling her to abort? It's a tough call. If he's respecting her autonomy but expressing his stance, maybe not. If he's pressuring her without considering her feelings, maybe. But based on the context provided, the answer might hinge on whether the pressure is undue. Since they had prior discussions where she agreed to abort, and she's now hesitating, the guy's position might be seen as not the asshole. But if he's forcing her against her will, then yes. The GF's behavior complicates things. Given the circumstances, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance.\n"
