Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who asked the question on Reddit (the author) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to consider multiple angles.\n\nFirst, they're both young, 22 and 23, in a European country, Denmark. They've been dating since August, and the girlfriend has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. She repeatedly said she would get an abortion if pregnant. Now they found out she's 8 weeks pregnant, which requires a surgical abortion. \n\nThe author is pushing for the abortion because he's not ready for a kid, mentions work stress, financial issues, and that she's on welfare with mental health problems. He's also upset that she hid her past pregnancy and that she's been delaying the process. The girlfriend uses vulgar language about killing the baby and now wants to discuss the abortion with him, even though she's been slow in the process.\n\nLegally, in Denmark, abortion is available up to 12 weeks. Since she's 8 weeks, it's still within the chemical option time frame if she had acted faster. The author is frustrated that her delays led to needing surgery, which has higher risks, and he's not feeling empathy because of her actions.\n\nThe key points here are consent and respect in the relationship. The girlfriend has her own reasons for hesitating, maybe mixed feelings about the abortion despite what she previously said. The author is pressuring her to make a decision quickly, but they\u2019re both in a position where they\u2019re not ready. The girlfriend's actions (delaying, not being honest about her past pregnancy) might be a breach of trust, but the author's response could be seen as dismissive of her feelings, especially using terms like \"kill the baby,\" which might be harsh.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author's request for an abortion isn't inherently wrong since they're both not prepared. However, the way he's handling it\u2014maybe being dismissive of her emotions, using judgmental language\u2014could be problematic. The girlfriend's delays and dishonesty are issues too. The question is whether the author overstepped by telling her to get an abortion. Since both have contributed to the situation, it's a mutual issue.\n\nLegally, he's not forcing her; he's expressing his stance. But emotionally, relationships require compromise. The author might feel he's protecting both of them, but he's also taking away her autonomy in the decision. The girlfriend's hesitation might stem from conflicting feelings, and the author's frustration is valid, but his approach might lack empathy.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer isn't black and white. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting an abortion due to their circumstances, but his handling of the situation could be seen as lacking understanding. However, the primary question is whether he's in the wrong for advising the abortion. Since both are in agreement initially, but the girlfriend is now hesitating, the author's position is more about not wanting a child and pushing for her to follow through, which is his right. But the way he's approaching it might be where the issue lies. Since the question is if he's in the wrong, considering the context, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
