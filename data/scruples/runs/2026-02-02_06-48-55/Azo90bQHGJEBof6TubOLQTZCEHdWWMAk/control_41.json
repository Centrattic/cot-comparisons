Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. They started dating in August, and the girlfriend mentioned she can't get pregnant due to PCOS. When she becomes pregnant, the author advises an abortion, but she's hesitating in the process, leading to a surgical abortion now. The author feels she's being dishonest because she claimed she couldn't get pregnant and had a past pregnancy. He's upset she didn't act faster and that she's using vulgar language about the abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The girlfriend is within the legal window for abortion in Denmark. The author's role here is advising her, but ultimately, the decision should be hers. Even though they discussed her stance on abortion beforehand, once the pregnancy occurs, it's her body, and the decision isn't just about their relationship but her rights. The author's insistence on the abortion could be seen as pressuring her, which might be wrong.\n\nThe author mentions that she delayed the process, but the girlfriend might have had her own reasons for hesitation, fear, or uncertainty. The author's frustration about her not acting quickly could indicate he's not fully respecting her autonomy. Also, the way he phrases \"I don't feel bad for her\" suggests a lack of empathy towards her situation, which is problematic.\n\nThe girlfriend's past pregnancy and the author's discovery of that fact adds to his distrust. However, if she didn't lie about her medical condition but just misunderstood or miscommunicated, that's different. The author's main issue seems to be about trust and the decision-making process. But in terms of wrongdoing, the author is the one advising an abortion and possibly pressuring her, which could be against her rights. So the answer might be A, he's in the wrong for pressuring her and not respecting her autonomy in the decision.\n"
