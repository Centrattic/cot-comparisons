Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style post is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is 22, his girlfriend is 23, they're in Europe, specifically Denmark. They started dating in August, and she mentioned she can't get pregnant due to PCOS. She also said she would get an abortion if she ever got pregnant. Now, she's pregnant, 8 weeks along, and the author is advising her to abort. The girlfriend is being slow in the process, using vulgar language, and there's a history she hid a previous pregnancy and her fertility status might not be as she claimed.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion. Let's consider the key points. The girlfriend's right to bodily autonomy is crucial here. Even if the author is against the pregnancy, the decision to terminate is hers, especially since they're not married and the legal age for abortion in Denmark is up to 12 weeks. The author's influence over her decision might be problematic, especially if he's pressuring her, which can be seen as controlling. Also, the girlfriend's hesitation and the reasons she gave (like not wanting to risk her fertility) might be valid. The author's arguments about stress, financial issues, and future plans are personal, but they don't override her autonomy. \n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's history of hiding a past pregnancy and possibly misleading him about her fertility could affect the relationship's trust, but that doesn't necessarily make the author right in pressuring her. The author's actions could be seen as dismissing her feelings and autonomy. The girlfriend's use of vulgar language is concerning, but it doesn't justify the author's role in pressuring her. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations in Denmark, abortion is legal, and the woman has the right to choose. The author's insistence might be seen as undermining her agency. Even if the author has valid concerns about their future, the decision should be mutual, but the girlfriend's autonomy must be respected. The author's anger about her hiding her past pregnancy and fertility status is a relationship issue, not a justification for pressuring her on the abortion. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the right because he's pressuring his partner about a medical decision that should be hers to make. Even if there are disagreements, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is a personal one, and the author's influence here might be harmful. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
