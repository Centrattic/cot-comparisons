Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the man asking if it's his fault for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend has PCOS and thought she couldn't get pregnant. She mentioned that if she did get pregnant, she would just abort. Now she is pregnant and there's some delay in the process leading to a surgical abortion. The man is worried about their current life situations\u2014she's on welfare, he works a lot, they can't handle a child now. She uses vulgar language about the abortion, which he finds offensive. She also hid a past pregnancy and now is hesitating, leading to a more complicated procedure.\n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong for suggesting the abortion. The key points here are about consent, autonomy, and the girlfriend's actions. The girlfriend is the one who can make the decision about her own body. The man is expressing his opinion, but the girlfriend's autonomy is a big factor. Also, she delayed the process, which might have been intentional. However, the man is not forcing her; he's just expressing his stance. The girlfriend's actions\u2014like hiding past pregnancy and delaying\u2014might have contributed to the situation. The use of vulgar language and her hesitation could indicate her own internal conflict. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while he's sharing his views, the final decision lies with her. But he's not in a position to make that choice for her. However, the context of their relationship and his reasons (like financial stress) are valid. The fact that she delayed might mean she was conflicted all along. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether he's forcing her to make a decision or just stating his position. Since he's not forcing her, but she's the one facing the medical procedure, the responsibility is hers. However, his role in pressuring her might be an issue. But given the description, he's more concerned about their future and she's the one making the decision. So maybe he's not in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted because the girlfriend's actions also played a role. Still, the main question is whether he's at fault. Since he's advising her based on their circumstances, maybe he's not wrong. So answer B.\n"
