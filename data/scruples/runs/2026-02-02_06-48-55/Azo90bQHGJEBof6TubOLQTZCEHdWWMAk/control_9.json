Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend found out she's pregnant. She has PCOS and claimed she couldn't get pregnant, but it turns out she was pregnant before around 10 years ago. She delayed the abortion process by not getting a test quickly and missing appointments, leading to a surgical abortion being necessary instead of a chemical one. The author is concerned about their current situations\u2014his job stress, her mental health, financial issues, and future plans. He's advising her to proceed with the abortion, which she's now hesitating about.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author is pressuring her to abort, which she initially said she would do but now is unsure. He's using his reasons like financial instability and inability to care for a child. The girlfriend's actions in delaying the process led to a more complex procedure. Also, she misrepresented her medical history by hiding a past pregnancy.\n\nNow, considering ethics and rights. A woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including pregnancy. The author is pressuring her to make a decision that aligns with his circumstances, which could be seen as undermining her autonomy. However, she's also not being fully transparent with her own medical history and delaying the process, which complicates things.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, autonomy is a key principle. Even if both partners have concerns, the final decision should rest with the pregnant individual. The author's stance is that he's advising based on their current situations, but that doesn't mean he's in the wrong for expressing his concerns. However, pressuring someone to terminate a pregnancy could be seen as problematic, especially if her decision is influenced by his arguments.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of her delaying the process. If she's the one causing the delay, leading to a more complicated procedure, maybe the author's frustration is somewhat justified. However, the core issue is his role in advising the abortion. He's not the one carrying the pregnancy, so his input should be respected, but ultimately, the decision is hers.\n\nIn terms of the question of \"AITA,\" it's about whether he's in the wrong. If he's pressuring her to abort when she's now hesitant, and if her decision is being influenced by his stress about their situations, he might be in the wrong because it's her body. However, the fact that she delayed and misrepresented her medical history complicates things. But ultimately, the right to decide is hers, so advising her to terminate could be seen as wrong if she's now conflicted.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the decision is hers, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. Wait, no\u2014if he's pressuring her to make a decision that's against her current wishes, maybe he's in the wrong. But the initial question is about telling her to get an abortion. If she's hesitant and he's pushing for it, even if she delayed, it's his role to support her decision rather than push his own. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, since she delayed and caused the situation to require a surgical abortion, and he's advising based on their circumstances, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the ethical stance is that the woman's autonomy is the primary concern. So regardless of her delays, he's suggesting an abortion, which is her right to refuse. But the question is if he's in the wrong for advising it. If she's hesitant and he's pushing, then maybe he's not in the wrong because he's sharing his position, but if he's pressuring her against her wishes, that could be wrong. The post says she asked if he wanted her to abort, and he said yes. But she then didn't reschedule. The line between advice and pressure is thin here.\n\nIn many cultures and legal systems, the pregnant person has the final say. So if he's advising her to abort, but she's now hesitant, he's not wrong for expressing his opinion, but if he's pressuring her, it's more complex. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given that he's not the one carrying the pregnancy, he's not in the wrong for voicing his stance, even if it's against her wishes. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
