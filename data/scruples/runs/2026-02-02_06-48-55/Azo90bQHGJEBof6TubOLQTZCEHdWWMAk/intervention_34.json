Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suggesting that their girlfriend get an abortion, while the girlfriend is hesitant and the author feels she's been dishonest about her medical history.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple is in a relationship, and the girlfriend became pregnant. She initially told him she couldn't get pregnant due to PCOS, but later admitted she had been pregnant before, which contradicts her previous statement. The author is advocating for an abortion, possibly because he's not ready for a child and there are financial and stability issues. The girlfriend is delaying the process, leading to a surgical abortion with higher risks. The author feels she's misused his trust by not being honest about her medical history and pregnancy history.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author is pressuring the girlfriend to have an abortion. In many relationships, decisions about pregnancy are mutual, and one person can't unilaterally decide for the other. However, in some contexts, especially if there's a shared agreement, it might be different. But in this case, the girlfriend is the one carrying the pregnancy and has the final say legally. The author's insistence might be seen as controlling or dismissive of her autonomy.\n\nThe girlfriend's behavior is also in question. She delayed the abortion process, which the author sees as her needing the surgical option. But she might have had her own reasons for the delay, maybe emotional, or perhaps she was trying to process the decision. The fact that she was hesitant and questioned his reasons could indicate she was conflicted. Also, she mentioned using vulgar language, which might be her way of coping with stress.\n\nThe author's argument is that she lied about her fertility history. If she had a previous pregnancy and PCOS was a result of that, that's a red flag for the author. However, if no doctor explicitly stated she couldn't get pregnant, maybe she misunderstood her condition. Her honesty about that is questionable.\n\nLegally, in Denmark, abortion is available up to 12 weeks. The girlfriend's delay pushed the procedure to surgical. The author is upset that she didn't act faster, but maybe she was struggling with the decision. It's possible she wasn't ready to terminate the pregnancy despite her initial stance, which could be a valid emotional conflict.\n\nThe author's main point is about trust and honesty. If the girlfriend misrepresented her medical history, that's a breach of trust. However, the author is also making decisions about her body, which is a significant ethical issue. Even if he's not the biological father, if they're in a committed relationship, the decision about the pregnancy affects both of them. But ultimately, the woman has the right to make that decision herself.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's pressuring her to terminate the pregnancy, which she's now hesitant about. His reasons are valid in terms of readiness for parenthood, but the way he's approaching it, maybe by telling her to abort rather than supporting her decision, could be problematic. The fact that he's upset about the delay and the surgical risk might indicate he's not fully respecting her autonomy in the process. However, if she had been dishonest, that complicates things.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's delay could be due to her own indecision, which the author is now criticizing. The author might be in the wrong for not supporting her through the process and instead being critical of her decisions. Also, the argument about her fertility history\u2014if she didn't lie outright but had a misunderstanding, that's different from intentional deception.\n\nIn summary, the author is pressuring an abortion, which is a significant issue because the decision should be hers. Even with valid concerns, his approach may be controlling. However, her dishonesty about her medical history adds another layer. But ultimately, the right to decide is hers. So the author might be in the wrong for trying to dictate her choice, despite the context.\n"
