Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling his girlfriend to get an abortion after she became pregnant. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The couple has been dating since August, and the girlfriend has PCOS, which they believed made pregnancy impossible. She told him she would get an abortion if she ever got pregnant. Now she's pregnant, and they found out two weeks ago. The author is pressuring her to abort because he feels unprepared\u2014for work, financial stability, and they both have their own issues. She's been slow in the process, leading to a surgical abortion instead of a chemical one. She also had a past pregnancy she didn't mention. The author is upset because she lied about not being able to get pregnant and hiding her history.\n\nThe key points here are the author's decision to push for an abortion without considering her autonomy. Even though he has valid concerns about their readiness, the right to make decisions about one's own body is a major ethical issue. The author is making the decision for her, which is a violation of her autonomy. Additionally, the girlfriend's hesitation and the author's insistence might lead to more stress and conflict. \n\nThe law in Denmark allows abortion up to 12 weeks, but the method depends on the gestation stage. Since she went past 8 weeks due to delays, it's surgical. The author blames her for the delay, but the responsibility for the decision lies with her. The author's main argument is that they aren't ready, but that's a common concern in unplanned pregnancies. However, the ethical aspect is about respecting her choice. Even if their situation is challenging, the author shouldn't dictate her medical decisions. \n\nThe girlfriend's past pregnancy and current welfare status might be complicating factors, but that doesn't justify the author making the decision for her. Trust is broken if she misrepresented her medical history, but the author still shouldn't override her autonomy. The core issue is consent and mutual decision-making. The author's stance seems to prioritize his own readiness over her right to choose, which is a significant ethical flaw. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy in the decision-making process regarding her pregnancy.\n"
