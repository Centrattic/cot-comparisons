Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for suggesting his girlfriend get an abortion. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the girl has PCOS and was told she couldn't get pregnant. But now she is pregnant. The author is against having a kid due to their current situations\u2014his work stress, her welfare, mental health, and their financial instability. She initially said she'd get an abortion if pregnant, but now she's hesitating. She used vulgar language about killing the baby and later revealed a past pregnancy she didn't mention. She also delayed the abortion process, leading to a surgical procedure with higher risks.\n\nThe author feels she lied about not being able to get pregnant and hid her past pregnancy. He's upset she didn't act faster, which forced her into a more invasive procedure. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for pushing for the abortion.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint in Denmark, abortion is allowed up to 12 weeks, which she's already passed, so surgical is necessary. The author's main argument is about their readiness for parenthood. The girl's behavior\u2014hesitation, delays, and past pregnancy\u2014might indicate she's not fully committed to the abortion. The author's responsibility here is a bit tricky. While he has a right to his stance on not wanting a child, he's also involved in a situation where the decision is ultimately hers, as reproductive rights are personal. However, given they're a couple, mutual decisions are expected. \n\nBut the author's main point is about trust issues due to her not disclosing past pregnancy and possibly lying about fertility. He might feel betrayed, which influences his decision to push for the abortion. However, the question is whether he's wrong for doing so. If he respects her autonomy but is concerned about their future, maybe he's not in the wrong. Yet, pressuring her might be an issue if she's conflicted. The situation is complex with emotional and ethical layers. But based on the information given, the author's stance seems to be about their circumstances, which is valid. However, the way he's handling it\u2014maybe being harsh about her delays and past\u2014could be seen as wrong. But given the context, the answer might be B.\n"
