Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling their girlfriend to get an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The couple started dating in August, and the girlfriend had PCOS and told the author she couldn't get pregnant. She also said she would get an abortion if she ever did. Now they found out she's pregnant. The author is pushing for an abortion, and she's been slow in the process, leading to a surgical abortion. The author feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her fertility history and being hesitant about the abortion. \n\nThe author cites reasons like their financial situation, his workload, and her mental health. He also mentions she used vulgar language when talking about abortion and that she previously had a pregnancy, which she didn't disclose. The author is frustrated because she delayed the process, leading to a more invasive procedure. \n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the decision-making around the abortion. In many places, including Denmark, the decision to proceed with an abortion is the woman's right. The author is pressuring her to have an abortion, but she's hesitant and has her own reasons. The author's frustration might stem from feeling responsible for their future and their financial situation, but it's important to consider her autonomy.\n\nThe girlfriend's delays could be due to hesitation or fear, which is common in such situations. The author's criticism of her actions, like not acting quickly, might stem from not understanding her emotional state. Also, the fact that she had a previous pregnancy that wasn't mentioned might be a point of contention, but the author hasn't accused her of lying directly about PCOS\u2014just that she wasn't told she couldn't get pregnant. However, she did mention she couldn't get pregnant, which might have been a miscommunication.\n\nThe use of vulgar language when discussing the abortion from her side is notable, but the author's response in pushing for the abortion might be seen as valid if he's trying to support her decision-making process. However, the central question is about his responsibility here. Since the decision to abort is hers, the author's role in pressuring her could be problematic, especially if he's not respecting her autonomy. Even if he's concerned about circumstances, the final decision should be hers. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if he's trying to be honest about his inability to support a child right now. However, if he's forcing her to make a decision that she's not comfortable with, that could be an issue. The key here is whether he's respecting her agency. The girlfriend's delays and hesitation might be due to internal conflict, which the author is now criticizing, which could be seen as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nIn terms of ethics and relationships, both partners need to communicate and support each other's decisions. If the author is pressuring her into a decision that she's not ready for, that could be wrong. However, if he's simply stating his stance and not forcing her to go through with the abortion, it's more about their mutual decision-making. But the girlfriend did mention she wanted to ask him if he still wanted her to abort before proceeding, indicating some level of shared decision-making. However, ultimately, the decision is hers.\n\nGiven that, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his stance, but he might be in the wrong if he's pressuring her into making a choice she's not comfortable with. The question is whether he's doing that. The post says he told her to get an abortion, which could be seen as pressuring her, especially if she's not fully on board. However, considering the context of their relationship and his reasons (financial, stress, future plans), it's a complex situation. The key point is that the decision to abort is hers, and his role is to support her decision, not dictate it. If he's not respecting her autonomy, then he's in the wrong. But if he's trying to be honest about his own limitations, he might not be. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether his actions crossed the line into coercion. The girlfriend's hesitation and delays suggest that she's not fully committed to the abortion, which the author is now holding against her. This could imply that he's not supporting her emotional state but is instead focused on the outcome he wants. In that case, he might be in the wrong. However, if he's just stating his position and the girlfriend is the one not acting on it, then the issue is more about her actions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. Since he's not forcing her but expressing his stance, he might not be in the wrong. However, if the pressure is undue, then yes. The answer is likely B (No), as he's not in the wrong for expressing his position, but the situation is nuanced.\n"
