Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe author is 22, his girlfriend is 23. They started dating in August. She told him she has PCOS and can't get pregnant. He says she always said if she ever got pregnant, she'd abort. Now she's pregnant, and he's telling her to get an abortion. She's been slow in the process, forgetting tests, missing appointments, etc. She didn't call for an immediate appointment in Denmark, which is possible. She uses vulgar language about killing the baby. She also had a past pregnancy she didn't mention. He's upset because she withheld info about her past pregnancy and that she might be able to get pregnant, not due to PCOS. He feels she misused his trust. The author is asking if he's at fault.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate this. First, the girl is 23 and pregnant, which is her body. The author is pressuring her to abort, even though they're not in a position to have a child. The girl's hesitation might be because of her own reasons. She might be conflicted, as she initially said she would abort but now is hesitant. The author is making the decision for her, which is controlling. Also, she's on welfare, has mental health issues, and relies on him financially. He's supporting her but wants her to work towards her future. However, the key issue is autonomy. The woman has the right to make decisions about her own body and pregnancy. The author is not in the position to decide for her. Even if he has concerns about their ability to parent, that's her choice to make. Additionally, she might have hidden past pregnancy info, but that's her history. The author's main action is pressuring her for an abortion, which is a violation of her autonomy. Even if she's being slow, the decision should be hers. So, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy. The answer should be A.\n"
