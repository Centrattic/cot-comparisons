Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the guy in the situation) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the couple is in a relationship for about a year. The girlfriend has PCOS and has been told she can't get pregnant, but she previously had a pregnancy 10 years ago. Now she's pregnant again. The guy pressured her to have an abortion, and she's been slow in the process, leading to a surgical abortion because it's past the 8-week mark. The guy is concerned about being a good parent given their current situations\u2014his job, her mental health, financial issues. He's also upset that she didn't tell him about her past pregnancy and that she might be able to get pregnant without PCOS being an issue.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The guy's reasons for the abortion are based on their inability to handle parenthood now. On the other hand, the girlfriend's hesitation could be due to her own feelings about the abortion, maybe some ambivalence. The fact that she delayed the process might have made the procedure more complicated, but was that her fault? In Denmark, it's possible to get immediate appointments for free, so maybe she did slow things down, but why? Maybe she was conflicted.\n\nThe guy is also making assumptions about her fertility, which she claimed was impossible. She hid her past pregnancy, which could be a red flag. However, the guy is pressuring her to terminate a pregnancy, which is a significant decision. Even if they both agree it's not the right time, the method of pressuring and the way he's handling it might be problematic. Also, using vulgar language about killing the baby is harsh. But maybe she's just using strong terms to express her feelings.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual decision-making. If the girlfriend is being pressured by the guy to make a decision that's not hers to make, that's an issue. Even if they have financial and personal reasons, the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be hers. The guy's role in pushing her might be overstepping, especially if she's not fully on board. Also, her delays might indicate internal conflict, and his frustration there is understandable but not excusable if he's using it to justify pressuring her.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's making the decision for her, yes. But if they're both discussing and he's voicing his concerns, maybe not. The line is blurry. The girlfriend's actions (delaying, not telling about past pregnancy) are also issues. But the main question is about the author's actions\u2014telling her to get an abortion. If he's respecting her autonomy and they're making it together, it's okay. If he's pressuring her against her will, it's wrong. The way the story is told, he's explaining his reasons and she's hesitant, but he's ultimately pushing her. Given that, maybe he's in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy and her process. So answer A (Yes).\n"
