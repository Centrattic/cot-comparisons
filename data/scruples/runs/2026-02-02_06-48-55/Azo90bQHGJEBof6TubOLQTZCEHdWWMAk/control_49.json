Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted is in the wrong for suggesting their girlfriend get an abortion. The situation is complex, so I need to consider various factors.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had PCOS and claimed she couldn't get pregnant. But now she's pregnant, and she had been pregnant before around 10 years ago, which she didn't disclose. The author found out she was pregnant and she initially said she'd get an abortion, but now hesitated, leading to delays. The author is concerned about their readiness for parenthood, financial stability, and future plans. They feel she didn't take the process seriously, leading to a surgical abortion being necessary instead of a chemical one.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author says they've always been clear they don't want a kid yet. The girlfriend claimed she couldn't get pregnant, which the author now realizes might not be true since she had a previous pregnancy. She also delayed the abortion process, which the author sees as manipulation. The author feels she misused their trust by lying about her fertility history and delaying the procedure.\n\nLegally, in Denmark, abortion up to 12 weeks is allowed, and the author's suggestion is within legal bounds. However, the emotional and ethical aspects are tricky. The author is not the one carrying the pregnancy and thus doesn't have the same physical risks, but they are involved in the decision-making. The girlfriend's mental health and financial situation are also factors, but the author is concerned about their own capabilities.\n\nThe author's question is whether they're in the wrong for suggesting an abortion. From a legal standpoint, they're not. Ethically, it's about mutual decision-making. The girlfriend didn't reschedule the appointment and instead waited, which the author sees as a red flag. The author's main issue is feeling that the girlfriend lied about her fertility history and was not proactive in the abortion process. \n\nIn relationships, both parties should have open communication about their expectations. The author felt the girlfriend wasn't honest and was delaying, which led to the author making a decision based on their own readiness. The girlfriend's use of vulgar language about the baby and her past pregnancy could indicate underlying issues, but that's her responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author isn't in the wrong for making a decision based on the information they had and their own circumstances. The girlfriend's actions contributed to the situation, and the author is entitled to their stance on parenthood at this time.\n"
