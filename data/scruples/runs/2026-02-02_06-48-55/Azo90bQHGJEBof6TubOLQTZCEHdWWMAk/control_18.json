Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the person (let's call him John) is 22, his girlfriend (Jane) is 23. They started dating in August. Jane had PCOS and had told John she couldn't get pregnant. She also said if she did, she'd just get an abortion. Now, two weeks ago, they found out she was pregnant. She went to the gynecologist and is 8 weeks along. In Denmark, up to 8 weeks it's a chemical abortion, but after that it's surgical. \n\nThe problem is that Jane delayed the process. She forgot to buy a test for a few days, slept through an appointment, and then had to wait longer for a new one. Because of this delay, she's now at the surgical stage. John is upset because he doesn't want kids right now due to his job and their financial situations. He's also worried about future pregnancy risks from the surgical abortion. \n\nJane used vulgar language about killing the baby and mentioned she was pregnant before 10 years ago, which John sees as a red flag because she claimed she couldn't get pregnant. John feels she lied about not being able to conceive and kept the previous pregnancy secret. \n\nJohn hasn't expressed wanting a child yet, but he's been clear he doesn't want one now. Jane went to the doctor but didn't proceed with the abortion and instead waited to discuss with John. Now John is asking if he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion.\n\nSo, the key points here are: consent in the relationship, autonomy over reproductive decisions, honesty between partners, and the emotional dynamics. \n\nJohn's main argument is that he's not ready for a child, they can't afford it, and he doesn't want to be a father now. But he's also upset that Jane didn't act quickly, leading to a more invasive procedure, and that she lied about her fertility history. \n\nHowever, in most ethical and legal contexts, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including whether to continue a pregnancy. Even if John doesn't want the child, the ultimate decision lies with Jane. The fact that she delayed the process doesn't necessarily mean she's wrong; maybe she was conflicted or scared. \n\nJohn's request for an abortion is his opinion, but he can't make that decision for her. The question is whether he's at fault for expressing that opinion. If he's being supportive but clear about his stance, maybe not. But if he's pressuring her or trying to control her decision, that's different. However, since he's stated he's explicitly said no to having a child, it's his honest position. \n\nThe issue with Jane's past pregnancy and her PCOS: If she misrepresented her fertility status, that's a problem in their relationship, but does that make John wrong for wanting an abortion? It complicates their trust, but the decision to terminate is still Jane's. \n\nJohn's frustration with her delay might indicate he's not considering her emotional state. Maybe she's conflicted, or struggling with mental health, which he acknowledges. But in terms of right and wrong, the legal and ethical right to an abortion is on the woman's side. \n\nSo, even if John is frustrated and feels betrayed, he's not in the wrong for expressing his stance against having a child. However, the question is whether he is at fault for telling her to get an abortion. Since he's clear on his position, and she's the one making the final decision, he's not wrong for stating his preference. \n\nBut also, if Jane felt pressured by his arguments (like about her not being able to support the child), that could be another angle. But the original question is about him telling her to get an abortion. So, if he's being honest about his wishes and she's the one choosing, he isn't necessarily in the wrong. \n\nHowever, there's the aspect of trust. Jane lied about her fertility and past pregnancy. That's her being dishonest, but John's response is to push for an abortion. But even then, the decision is hers. \n\nSo overall, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's expressing his legitimate concerns and stance on not wanting a child, even if there are underlying trust issues in the relationship. The final decision rests with Jane, and John isn't forcing her; he's just sharing his position.\n"
