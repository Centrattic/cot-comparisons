Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post (the author) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation involves their pregnancy, her medical history, and their communication issues.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend had PCOS and previously said she couldn't get pregnant, but it turns out she was pregnant before. She also delayed the abortion process, leading to a surgical procedure instead of a chemical one. The author is concerned about their ability to support a child financially and emotionally, and he's urging her to proceed with the abortion. The girlfriend, however, is hesitating and even questioning his reasons, using vulgar language when talking about the abortion. She also lied about her fertility history.\n\nNow, considering the legal context in Denmark where abortion is allowed up to 12 weeks, but the method changes after 8 weeks. The delay in her actions caused her to be at 8 weeks, requiring surgery. The author feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her past pregnancy and current hesitancy. He's not in favor of having a child yet, and he's communicated this clearly.\n\nThe key points here are about consent, honesty, and shared decision-making. The girlfriend didn't reschedule the appointment earlier, leading to a more invasive procedure. Also, she withheld information about her previous pregnancy. The author's decision to push for an abortion is based on his readiness and their circumstances. However, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is a personal one, and coercion or pressure can be problematic. Even if the author has valid concerns, the final decision should be mutual and respectful. The girlfriend's hesitation and the author's insistence might indicate a lack of mutual respect here. The author's actions could be seen as undermining her autonomy, especially since she's the one undergoing the procedure. Despite her hesitations, forcing her to make a decision she's uncomfortable with might not be right. The fact that she sought his opinion at the gynecologist shows she wanted his input, but his response, as described, seems to be more about his own stressors than hers. Also, using vulgar language about the baby might indicate her emotional state, but the author's response in telling her to abort could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. However, the author is clear about his stance, and the girlfriend's actions (delay, dishonesty) contributed to the situation. So, is the author in the wrong? Well, the decision to abort is hers, and while he has the right to express his opinion, pressuring her might be problematic. But given her actions, maybe his response is a reaction to her dishonesty. It's a bit of a gray area. The girlfriend's behavior is concerning, but the author's insistence might not be entirely his fault. The answer depends on whether his actions are considered coercive. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and considering that the final decision rests with the woman, even if he's validly concerned, pushing her to abort could be seen as wrong. But in this case, she's the one who didn't act promptly. Hmm. Maybe it's a B, not in the wrong.\n"
