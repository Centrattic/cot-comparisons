Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author suggesting their girlfriend get an abortion, which she ends up not doing. The girlfriend has PCOS and previously said she couldn't get pregnant, but it turns out she was lying about that and had a past pregnancy. The author is upset she was dishonest and that she delayed the abortion process, leading to a surgical one. The author feels she misused his trust and isn't feeling bad for her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author told his girlfriend to get an abortion, which is a major decision. Even though they are in a relationship, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is typically the woman's right. The girlfriend's hesitation and delay might be due to her own feelings about the abortion, not just being slow. The author is putting pressure on her, which could be seen as wrong because it's her body and her choice. Additionally, the girlfriend's history of pregnancy and PCOS diagnosis might be relevant, but the author's role in pressuring her is questionable.\n\nThe author claims he's not ready for kids and has valid reasons about stress and financial issues. However, he's making the decision for her. The girlfriend's use of vulgar language might indicate her own distress, but the author's response to that is also problematic. The fact that she delayed because she was hesitant could mean she's conflicted, and the author's insistence on abortion might not be respecting her autonomy. \n\nAlso, the author's reaction to her past pregnancy and PCOS diagnosis shows he might not have been fully informed, which adds to the complexity. But regardless, telling someone to abort a pregnancy is a serious matter. Even if there are valid concerns, the final decision should rest with the pregnant person. The author's lack of support and pressure could contribute to a toxic dynamic. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is in the wrong for pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion against her will, especially since it's her body and her choice. The answer should be A.\n"
