Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The couple is young, in their early 20s, in a European country (Denmark). The girlfriend has PCOS and has said she can't get pregnant, but now she is. She mentioned she would get an abortion if pregnant. However, she delayed the process, leading to a surgical abortion. The author is pressuring her to have the abortion, and she's hesitating. She also revealed a past pregnancy, which she didn't disclose before. The author feels she's been dishonest and is upset she's not moving faster with the abortion process.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions. He's telling her to get an abortion, which she initially said she would do. But she's now hesitating. The author is concerned about their financial situation, his work stress, and future plans. He's also upset about her past pregnancy and not being truthful about her fertility. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nIn many places, including Denmark, abortion is legal, so the procedure itself isn't illegal. However, the ethical aspect here is about the relationship dynamics. Both partners should ideally agree on such a significant decision. The author is pressuring her, and she's feeling conflicted. Even though she delayed, her hesitation might indicate she's not fully on board anymore. The author's insistence might be dismissive of her feelings, especially if she's now considering alternatives.\n\nAlso, the author points out her dishonesty about being infertile and hiding her past pregnancy. That's a valid concern in terms of trust. But the main issue is whether he's in the wrong for urging the abortion. Even if he's justified in his reasons (financial, stress, etc.), the decision to terminate a pregnancy is typically hers to make in Denmark. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but ethically, it's complex. Pressuring a partner on such a personal decision can be problematic. The author might not be respecting her autonomy, especially if she's now uncertain.\n\nAdditionally, the way he's framing it (calling her decisions slow, not rescheduling, etc.) suggests he's placing blame on her actions, which could indicate a lack of support. Even if his reasons are valid, the approach might be wrong. However, he's also in a position where he's not ready for a child and is concerned about their future. So there's a balance between his rights and her autonomy.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners might share some, but the key is that the decision to have an abortion is ultimately hers. The author's role is to support her in making that decision, not dictate it. So, if he's pressuring her without considering her emotional state and autonomy, that's where he might be in the wrong. The answer likely leans towards him being in the wrong (A) because he's not respecting her agency in the decision-making process, even if his concerns are understandable.\n"
