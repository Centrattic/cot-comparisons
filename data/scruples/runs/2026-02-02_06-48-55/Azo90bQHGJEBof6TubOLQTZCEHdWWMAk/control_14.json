Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who asked for advice on Reddit (the author) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple is in a new relationship, both are in their early 20s. The girlfriend has PCOS, which they were told makes pregnancy difficult. She's been clear from the start that if she ever got pregnant, she would have an abortion. Now they found out she's pregnant. The author is advising her to get the abortion.\n\nThe key points here are: the woman's autonomy over her body, the legal context in Denmark regarding abortion procedures, and the couple's personal circumstances. The author argues that she delayed the process, leading to a surgical abortion which has higher risks, including infertility. He also mentions her past pregnancy and current financial and mental health issues.\n\nBut wait, in Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks. The woman is at 8 weeks now, so the surgical option is available. The author is pushing her to make a decision she's already discussed as her default. However, she's hesitant now, possibly because of the procedure's risks. The author is upset she didn't act faster, but he never indicated he wanted a child. She also withheld her past pregnancy, which the author feels is a breach of trust.\n\nLegally, the woman has the right to make her own medical decisions. Even if she's hesitant, the decision to terminate is hers. The author's role here is to support her, not to pressure her into a choice. However, the author is in a position where he's not ready for parenthood and has valid concerns about their current life situations. But the fact remains that the decision isn't his to make, and suggesting she get an abortion when she's unsure could be seen as overstepping. \n\nAlso, the woman's hesitation and the delay in scheduling could be due to her own anxiety or the complexity of the situation. The author's frustration might stem from his own stress about potential parenthood, but the responsibility for the decision lies with her. \n\nThe author's knowledge that she previously had a pregnancy and possibly misrepresented her infertility adds to his trust issues, but that doesn't make his demand for an abortion justified. The core issue here is respecting her autonomy versus his personal stance on the situation.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author's concerns are valid, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is the woman's right. Pressuring her to do so, especially after she's expressed hesitation, could be seen as disrespectful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy in this critical decision.\n"
