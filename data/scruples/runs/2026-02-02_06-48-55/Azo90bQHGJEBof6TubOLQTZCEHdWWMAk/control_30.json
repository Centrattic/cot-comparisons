Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy, who's 22, and his girlfriend, who's 23, found out she's pregnant. They've been dating since August, and she told him she has PCOS and can't get pregnant. But now she's pregnant, and he's suggesting she get an abortion. She's hesitating, delaying the process, and then he's upset that she didn't reschedule and ended up needing a surgical abortion instead of a chemical one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The user is from Denmark, where abortion is legal up to 12 weeks. She's at 8 weeks now, so the procedure is possible. But she delayed, leading to a surgical abortion. The author is upset about the delay, but is it his place to make her decisions?\n\nHe says she told him she couldn't get pregnant, but she actually was. That's a red flag for him. Also, she had a past pregnancy she didn't mention. He's not okay with having kids right now due to his job and their financial situation. She's on welfare, has mental health issues, and relies on him financially. He's okay helping as long as she works towards a future.\n\nNow, the key questions: Is he in the wrong for pressuring her to abort? Does he have the right to make that decision for her? In most places, the woman has the right to decide about her own body. Even if they're in a relationship, it's not his choice to make. Also, he's using her for support but expects her to follow his wishes. Her delaying the procedure might be because she's conflicted. She might have changed her mind after initially saying she would abort. The author's frustration is understandable, but he's not the one who has to carry the pregnancy. \n\nHe's also upset that she didn't call for an immediate appointment and delayed the process. But ultimately, the decision to delay is hers. He's not responsible for her medical decisions, even if they impact him. However, he's honest about not wanting kids now. The issue is whether he's respecting her autonomy. The author is in a position where he's not ready for a child, but he can't force her to have an abortion. If she's now against it, he can't make her. So, is he in the wrong? Maybe not in expressing his stance, but if he's pressuring her or making her feel guilty, that's problematic. The fact that she went to the gynecologist and then didn't reschedule without talking to him might be her own decision. He's upset she didn't consult him, but it's her body. So the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) in terms of wanting an abortion, but there are ethical considerations about respecting her autonomy. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion, in the context of the situation, if she's now not proceeding with the abortion, he's not in the wrong for his initial stance. But maybe he's wrong to pressure her. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. The subreddit often sides with autonomy, so maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's making his stance clear, but the actual decision is hers. However, if he's forcing her to have an abortion, that's wrong. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for telling her to get one. Since he's not forcing her, but expressing his position, the answer might be B. But there's a nuance here. The author is in the right in stating his position, but he can't make her do it. So the answer is B.\n"
