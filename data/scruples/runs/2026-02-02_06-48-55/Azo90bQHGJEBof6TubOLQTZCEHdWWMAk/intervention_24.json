Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a guy in a relationship with his girlfriend, is asking if he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. The girlfriend has a history of PCOS and said she couldn't get pregnant, but she ended up pregnant anyway. Now she's considering the abortion, but she's been slow in the process, leading to needing a surgical one instead of a chemical one. The author is questioning her decisions and even says he doesn't feel bad about her needing the surgical abortion because she delayed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend mentioned she couldn't get pregnant, but now she's pregnant. She had a past pregnancy too, which she didn't disclose. The author feels lied to because her previous pregnancy contradicts her claim about not being able to get pregnant. She's also been hesitant about the abortion and delayed the process, leading to a more invasive procedure. The author is frustrated with her decisions, especially since he's working a lot and can't support a child right now. He's also concerned about her welfare and mental health, and he's not in a position to support a child.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. In many places, including Denmark, abortion is a legal right, and the decision is typically up to the woman. However, the author is pressuring her to make a decision that aligns with his own views, which might not be her choice. The girlfriend's autonomy is a key factor here. Even if she's delayed the process, the author has a right to his opinion, but he might be overstepping by making her feel like she must proceed with the abortion because of his reasons. The fact that she went to the gynecologist and considered his opinion before proceeding shows she's trying to involve him, but the final decision should be hers.\n\nThe author's frustration might stem from feeling misled about her fertility and her hesitancy in the abortion process. However, pressuring her to abort based on his inability to support a child might not be fair. He's also using her delays as a reason to not feel bad about her situation, which could be seen as dismissive of her emotional state and the reasons for her hesitation. The key points are reproductive rights, mutual trust in the relationship, and the pressure to make a life decision based on one's circumstances. The author's actions could be seen as undermining her autonomy, which is a significant issue. So, even if there are valid concerns on his side, the pressure he's placing on her might be where he's in the wrong.\n"
