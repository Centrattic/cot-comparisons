Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is the guy is asking if he's at fault for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. They're in Europe, Denmark to be specific. The girlfriend has PCOS and has been told she can't get pregnant, but she ended up pregnant anyway. The guy says she always said she'd get an abortion if she got pregnant. Now, she's been slow in the process, and when they found out she was 8 weeks along, it requires a surgical abortion. The guy is advocating for the abortion because he can't handle the responsibilities of a child right now. She started questioning his reasons, using vulgar language about killing the baby, and she revealed she was pregnant before, which he sees as a red flag. He feels she lied about not being able to get pregnant and hid her past pregnancy.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the legal aspect in Denmark allows abortion up to 12 weeks, so she's within the time frame. The woman's autonomy over her own body is a big factor here. The guy is pressuring her to have an abortion, which is her decision to make. Even if they discussed her intentions before, once she's pregnant, the choice is hers. The fact that she's hesitant and maybe delaying the process might be her way of coping, but he's using that as a reason to push for the abortion. Also, the emotional manipulation, like saying she lied about PCOS and hiding her past pregnancy, could be his way of justifying his stance, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's right in pushing for the abortion.\n\nThe key points here are consent and autonomy. The woman has the right to make decisions about her pregnancy. Even if the guy has concerns about being a parent right now, he can't make that choice for her. The fact that she's been slow in the process might reflect her internal conflict, but he's using that as a reason to criticize her. The answer would likely hinge on the principle that the woman's choice is paramount, regardless of the partner's opinions. So, the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and is pressuring her to make a decision that's ultimately hers.\n"
