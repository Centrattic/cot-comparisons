Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. \n\nFirst, the situation: They started dating in August. The girlfriend has PCOS and was told she can't get pregnant, but she ended up getting pregnant. She initially said she'd get an abortion if that happened. Now they found out she was pregnant, and there's been some delays in her getting the abortion. The guy is pushing for her to have the surgical one now, but she's hesitant. He's giving reasons like his work stress, her living on welfare, and not being ready for a kid. She's using vulgar terms about abortion and there's some hidden history about her past pregnancy.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy, trust, and communication. The woman is making her own reproductive decisions, which is her right. The man is pressuring her to abort, which can be a problem because she should have the final say. Also, she mentioned she was pregnant before, which he found out later\u2014maybe that's part of the trust issue. But he's also questioning her readiness and using his own stress as a reason. However, the decision to have an abortion isn't just on him; it's her body. He's not in the wrong just for suggesting it, but pressuring her and maybe not respecting her autonomy could be an issue. Also, her delays might be due to her own hesitations, not just her being slow. The fact that she's the one carrying the child means she has the right to decide the process. So, while the man has his reasons, the woman's autonomy is key here. The answer would likely be that he's not in the wrong (B), but some might argue he's overstepping by pressuring her. However, since the question is about whether he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion, and given the circumstances, the answer might be B (No).\n"
