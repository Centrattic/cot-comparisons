Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the scenario.\n\nSo, the author is 22, his girlfriend is 23, and they're in Europe, Denmark. They've been dating since August. The girlfriend has PCOS and told him she can't get pregnant. Also, she said she'd get an abortion if she ever got pregnant. Now, she is pregnant, and the author is pressuring her to get an abortion, but she's been slow in the process, leading to needing a surgical abortion. He's listing reasons why they can't have a child right now, like his work schedule, her financial issues, etc. She's been hesitant, even though she initially said she'd get an abortion. The author feels she misrepresented her fertility and withheld info about a past pregnancy. He's upset she's not acting quickly enough and is angry she didn't get the abortion sooner.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong for suggesting abortion. Legally, in Denmark, abortion is allowed up to 12 weeks, and the method depends on the gestation. She's at 8 weeks, so chemical or surgical. But she delayed, so now it's surgical. The author is frustrated because she didn't act faster. But is he in the wrong?\n\nWell, the girlfriend is the one who is pregnant, and the decision to have an abortion is typically hers. The author is pressuring her, but she's the one who is hesitant. He's making arguments about their readiness, which might be valid concerns, but does that make him wrong? Also, he mentions she used vulgar language about abortion, like \"kill the baby,\" which is harsh. But if she's the one who's pregnant and the one who needs to make the decision, maybe his role here is problematic. \n\nHe also feels she lied about not being able to get pregnant. She told him she had PCOS and couldn't get pregnant, but she was pregnant before 10 years ago. That's a red flag he's pointing out. However, maybe she didn't know her PCOS was resolved? Or maybe she misunderstood her condition. But the author is using that as a reason to trust her less. \n\nHe's frustrated she didn't act quickly, leading to the need for surgery. But the delay was on her part. He's not the one who had to schedule appointments, etc. So maybe he's not wrong in feeling she's responsible for the delay. But is he wrong for suggesting she get an abortion? That's a tricky part. In many contexts, suggesting abortion isn't inherently wrong, but it's more about whether he's pressuring her into it. However, she's the one who initially said she'd get an abortion if pregnant, so maybe he's just following through with her stated plan. \n\nBut the fact that she's now hesitant and the author is pushing her to terminate, even though she's having doubts, might be an issue. Also, the author is taking her hesitation as a sign of not wanting to proceed, but she might be conflicted. However, the user is the one asking if he's in the wrong. \n\nLooking at the community's typical responses to AITA posts, they often consider intent, context, and whether there was deception. The author didn't say they were ready for a child. He's honest about not being able to handle it right now. The girl made her own decisions, including the delay. The author's anger about her not acting faster might be justified, but does that make him right? Also, the fact that she misrepresented her fertility history adds to his frustration. \n\nI think the key points are: the author is not the one who has to carry the pregnancy, so his stance is more about their readiness. However, the decision to terminate is hers, and he's pressuring her. But if she initially said she'd abort and then changed her mind, maybe the author is just being consistent. However, the way he's expressing it, using \"AITA for telling her to get an abort?\" might be seen as him pressuring her, but if she's the one who's now unsure, maybe he's justified. \n\nBut in terms of ethics, is he in the wrong? Maybe not. Because he's making his stance clear based on their current life situations. However, if the girl feels pressured, maybe he is. But the post is from his perspective, so he's not the one who's pregnant. \n\nIn terms of the law, in Denmark, abortion is legal, so he's not breaking any laws. The question is more about moral blame. The community often looks at whether the person is being unreasonable. The author is stating his reasons clearly, and the girl is making decisions that he's not happy with. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut also, the girl's hesitation and delay leading to a more invasive procedure could be seen as her fault, so the author's frustration is justified. However, the author's use of strong language (\"AITA for telling my GF to get an abort?\") and his anger towards her for the delay might make him seem like he's not in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle: the author is taking responsibility for the girl's welfare (financially?), but she's not working towards her future. He's helping her, which might be okay as long as she's trying. But if she's not, maybe he's right to be concerned. \n\nOverall, considering all factors, the author might not be in the wrong for expressing his stance on not being ready for a child and pressuring her to proceed with the abortion, especially since she initially agreed to that course of action. However, the way he's handling the situation, being angry at her for the delay, might be problematic. But the core question is whether he's in the wrong for suggesting the abortion. Since he's not the one who has to carry the child, his position is valid. The girl is the one who made the decisions leading to the current situation. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
