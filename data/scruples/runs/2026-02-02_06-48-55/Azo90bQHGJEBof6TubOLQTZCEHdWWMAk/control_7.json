Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the couple is in a short-term relationship, having started in August. The girlfriend has PCOS and has told OP she can't get pregnant. But she got pregnant anyway. She mentioned she would get an abortion if that happened. Now, she's 8 weeks along, and the law in Denmark allows for surgical abortion up to 12 weeks. The girlfriend delayed the process\u2014forgot to buy a test, missed the doctor's appointment, and took longer than necessary. OP argues that her hesitation led to needing a surgical abortion, which has higher risks, including infertility. He's also upset she hid her past pregnancy and that she's being irresponsible with money and work. He feels she's using vulgar language about killing the baby. The girlfriend decided not to get the abortion without consulting him, even though she had the chance to reschedule.\n\nNow, considering ethics and rights. The woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. Even if OP is a parent, once the pregnancy is established, the decision is hers. OP's pressure to abort could be seen as violating her autonomy. Also, she might have been testing his commitment by getting pregnant, but that's not clear. The girlfriend's delays might be due to her own processing, anxiety, or other factors. The OP is in a position where he's making a judgment about her decisions, which might not be fair. However, he's concerned about their future and financial stability. But ultimately, the decision to terminate is hers. So, if he's pressuring her without respecting her autonomy, that's problematic. However, if he's sharing his concerns and she's not considering them, that's a different angle. But the question is if he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. In many ethical frameworks, the woman's autonomy is paramount. So, even if he's not in favor of the pregnancy continuing, he's not the one who has to carry it. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for pressuring her. However, some might argue that given their circumstances, his concerns are valid. But from a rights perspective, the woman's choice is key. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any other angle. Also, her past behavior might make him feel she's manipulative, but that doesn't negate her right to decide. So, likely, the answer is A.\n"
