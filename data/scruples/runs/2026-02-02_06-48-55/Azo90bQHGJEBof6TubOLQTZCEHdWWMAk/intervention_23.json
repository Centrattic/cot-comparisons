Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend got pregnant, and the author (the boyfriend) is being asked if he's at fault for telling her to get an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The boyfriend is 22, the girlfriend 23. They've been dating since August, and she mentioned she has PCOS and can't get pregnant. But now she's pregnant. The boyfriend wants her to get an abortion, and she's hesitant, using vulgar language when referring to the baby. He's listed reasons like his work schedule, her living on welfare, mental health issues, and not being ready for parenthood. She also had a past pregnancy around 10 years ago, which she didn't mention initially.\n\nHe's upset because she delayed the abortion process, leading to needing a surgical one instead of a chemical one. He feels she used his trust by claiming she couldn't get pregnant and hiding her past pregnancy. The question is whether he's in the wrong for pressuring her to abort.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical angles. In Denmark, abortion is legal up to 12 weeks, which she's now at 8 weeks. The author is advocating for the abortion, but the woman has the legal right to make that decision. Even if they were in a relationship, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is typically hers. The boyfriend's arguments about their readiness for parenthood are valid concerns, but does that justify pressuring her? Also, the girlfriend's hesitation and delays might be due to her own feelings about the abortion, which he might not fully understand. \n\nHe mentions she's been using vulgar language, which could indicate her emotional state. The fact that she delayed the process might be because she's conflicted, not just being careless. The boyfriend's frustration is understandable, but he's the one who's pushing for the abortion. The key point is that in most ethical and legal frameworks, the woman has autonomy over her body. Even if they were in an agreement before, she might have changed her mind or there could be complexities in her decision-making. \n\nHe also accuses her of misleading him by not disclosing her past pregnancy. That could be a breach of trust, but it's a separate issue from the abortion decision. However, the core of the question is whether he's in the wrong for telling her to abort. Since she's the one who has to make that medical decision, his role in pressuring her could be seen as overstepping, especially if he's using his influence to make her choose. Even if he has valid concerns, the ultimate decision isn't his to make. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's pressuring his partner into an abortion, which is her decision to make. The fact that she delayed might be due to her own hesitations, and his response is to question her actions rather than support her decision-making process.\n"
