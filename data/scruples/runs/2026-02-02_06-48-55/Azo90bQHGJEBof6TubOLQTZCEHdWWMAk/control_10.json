Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted on Reddit (the author) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to abort the pregnancy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple is young, in their early 20s, and they've been dating since August. The girlfriend mentioned from the start that she couldn't get pregnant due to PCOS and that if she did, she would abort. Now, they found out she's pregnant. The author is advising her to abort, and she's being slow in the process, leading to needing a surgical abortion instead of a medical one. He's also upset because she lied about her fertility history and previous pregnancy. He's concerned about their financial situations and ability to raise a child right now.\n\nThe key points here are consent and trust. The girlfriend didn't disclose her past pregnancy, and the author feels she misrepresented her fertility. However, the author is pressuring her to abort, which involves her body and autonomy. Even if they both don't want a child now, the decision to abort is hers to make. The author's role in pressuring her could be problematic because it's her right to choose. \n\nHe mentions she uses vulgar language about abortion, which might indicate discomfort or lack of support from her side, but he's the one giving the ultimatum. Even if he's not happy with her delays, suggesting abortion is a decision she must make independently. The fact that he's using her delays as a reason to not feel bad about her suffering could imply he's being judgmental rather than supportive. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author has valid concerns about their financial and emotional readiness, pressuring someone into an abortion can be seen as controlling. The girlfriend's autonomy is the central issue here. The author's actions, while perhaps coming from a place of practicality, infringe on her right to make her own medical decisions. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's deception about her medical history and previous pregnancy complicates things. But the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for advising the abortion. Since he's not forcing her, just expressing his stance, the onus is on her to make the choice. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but his situation is nuanced. But legally and ethically, the decision to abort is hers. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for expressing his opinion, but he's not the one making the final decision.\n"
