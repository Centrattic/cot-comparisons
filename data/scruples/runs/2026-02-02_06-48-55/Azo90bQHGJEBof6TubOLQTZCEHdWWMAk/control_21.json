Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author advising his girlfriend to get an abortion, which she later decides against. There are several points to consider here.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has PCOS and has been told she can't get pregnant, but there's no official medical confirmation. She also had a previous pregnancy a decade ago, which she didn't mention. The author is upset she didn't disclose this and that she delayed the abortion process, leading to a surgical rather than chemical procedure. He's concerned about their financial situations, her mental health, and his ability to support a child right now. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's main action here is suggesting an abortion, which the girlfriend is now hesitant about. Legally in Denmark, abortion is allowed up to 12 weeks, so she still has options. But the author's argument is that she delayed the process, making it more complicated. However, the girlfriend's hesitation and the emotional aspect might play a role in her decisions. \n\nEthically, this is tricky. The author is expressing his concerns about their readiness for parenthood, which is valid. However, pressuring someone about such a personal decision could be problematic. The girlfriend's use of vulgar language might be her way of coping with stress or anxiety. The author also seems to be placing a lot of responsibility on her financial and mental health status, which are legitimate factors, but it's important to consider mutual support in a relationship.\n\nThe author didn't explicitly want a child yet, which is clear, but the girlfriend's change of heart could be due to her own realizations. The key points here are consent, communication, and respect for each other's decisions. The author might feel wronged because of her withholding information and delaying the process, but the girlfriend's autonomy in making her own reproductive choices is crucial. \n\nIn many discussions like this, the autonomy of the individual to make decisions about their own body is a major factor. The author's advice might have been well-intentioned, but the girlfriend's right to choose, even if it changes, is important. The author's frustration is understandable, but the situation doesn't clearly point to him being in the wrong. There are valid arguments on both sides. However, since the question is whether he is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards B (No), as he was acting based on his concerns and the situation's circumstances.\n"
