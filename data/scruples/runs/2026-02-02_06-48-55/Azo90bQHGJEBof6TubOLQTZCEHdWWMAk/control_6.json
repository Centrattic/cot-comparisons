Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves an argument between a couple about whether the girlfriend should get an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The man is 22, the girlfriend 23. They've been dating since August. She has PCOS and said she can't get pregnant. She also mentioned that if she did, she'd get an abortion. Now she's pregnant, 8 weeks along. The laws in Denmark allow for chemical abortion before 8 weeks and surgical after. She delayed the process, leading to needing a surgical one. She hesitated, questions his reasons for wanting an abortion, uses strong language about it, and he finds out she was pregnant before, which she didn't mention. She also didn't confirm with him at the doctor's office and instead waited until later. The man is upset because she lied about being infertile and hid her past pregnancy, leading to a more invasive procedure. He's also concerned about their financial and life situations.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. Let's break it down. In many places, including Denmark, the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is a personal one, often made by the pregnant person. The man is advocating for an abortion, which she's now hesitant about. However, she delayed the process, possibly due to her own hesitations. He's frustrated because her delay led to a surgical procedure with more risks. She also used vulgar language, which might indicate her own stress or discomfort. \n\nThe man's actions: he's expressing his decision not to have the child, which she already knew. But he's pressuring her to get the abortion now, which she's hesitant about. However, in this scenario, she initially said she would get an abortion if pregnant, but now is changing her stance. The man feels she misled him about her fertility and past. \n\nLegally, the woman has the right to make decisions about her body, including abortion. Ethically, the man's right to his opinion versus her autonomy. However, the woman's delay in acting on her initial stated intention might complicate things. But he's now asking her to follow through on a decision she's now reluctant to make. The fact that she hesitated and then delayed might indicate she's conflicted, and the man's insistence could be adding stress. Also, the woman's past pregnancy and her PCOS history being possibly inaccurate adds to the man's distrust. \n\nBut from an ethical standpoint, even if she delayed, the decision about the pregnancy is hers. The man can express his opinion but can't force her. However, in their case, she did agree to the abortion but delayed, leading to a more complicated procedure. The man might feel wronged because she didn't act promptly. However, the woman's hesitation and change in stance might be her own internal conflict. \n\nIs the man in the wrong for pressuring her? Well, he's sharing his reasons, which are valid concerns about their financial situation and ability to care for a child. But pressuring her to make a decision she's now second-guessing could be seen as not respecting her autonomy. However, the woman initially agreed to the initial stance but now is changing. The man's frustration is understandable given her delay and misleading information. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both could have communicated better. The woman didn't act quickly on her initial decision, and the man is now holding her accountable. But the key is that the decision to terminate is hers. If she's now refusing, even after the delay, the man can't force her. However, in the post, she is considering getting the abortion but is hesitant, and the man is urging her to proceed. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's pressuring her to have the abortion despite her hesitation, that could be seen as wrong. However, given her initial statements and the delay leading to a more complex procedure, maybe his stance is a result of her actions. But ultimately, if she's now not proceeding, the man's insistence might not be in line with her current wishes. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether he's respecting her autonomy. If she's decided not to proceed with the abortion, he shouldn't force her. But if she's still considering it and he's encouraging her, maybe it's more about their communication issues. However, the man's question is about whether he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. If she's still considering it, maybe he's not wrong. But if she's decided against it, then his pressure is wrong. The situation is a bit murky. \n\nGiven that the woman initially said she would abort but now is hesitant and didn't act quickly, the man's frustration is there. But he's also pressuring her to follow through now. The woman's delay might mean that she's conflicted, and the man's insistence could be adding pressure. However, since she's the one carrying the pregnancy, the decision is hers. So, the man might not be in the wrong for expressing his opinion, but if he's pressuring her to make a decision she's not comfortable with, that could be problematic. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's expressing his stance based on their circumstances, but there's a nuance here. However, given the context of her initial agreement and the delay, his reaction is understandable. But ethically, he shouldn't force her. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong for telling her to get the abortion. If she's still considering it, maybe not. If she's decided against it, then yes. Since the woman hasn't decided yet and is hesitant, but the man is encouraging her to proceed, it's a matter of their communication. But given the woman's delay and the man's concerns, maybe the answer is B.\n"
