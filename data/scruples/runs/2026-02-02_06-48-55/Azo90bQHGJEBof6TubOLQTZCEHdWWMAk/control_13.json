Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple where the girlfriend got pregnant, and the guy is asking if he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. They're in a relationship that started in August. The girlfriend had PCOS and said she couldn't get pregnant. She also mentioned she'd get an abortion if she did. Now she's pregnant, and he's pressuring her to abort, but she's been slow in the process. The guy is concerned about their ability to support a child financially and his work stress. The girlfriend is hesitant, maybe because of the procedure type (surgical vs. chemical), and there's some history she didn't disclose, like a past pregnancy.\n\nThe main question is whether the guy is at fault. Let's break it down. The girlfriend lied about not being able to get pregnant and hid her past pregnancy. The guy trusted her and now feels misled. But he's also pressuring her to have an abortion, which is a major decision. In relationships, both partners should have mutual consent and support. If she's not ready and he's forcing her, that could be problematic. However, he's also concerned about their readiness for a child, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn many places, the decision to have an abortion is up to the woman, and pressuring her might be seen as wrong. But the girlfriend delayed the process, possibly leading to a more invasive procedure, which the guy points out. There's also a lack of communication from her side. She didn't reschedule the appointment and only asked him about the abortion at the last minute.\n\nSo, the guy's actions might be influenced by her dishonesty and the current circumstances. However, the key issue is whether he's in the wrong for pressuring her. If the law in Denmark allows for the abortion, and she's the one making the choice, then pressuring her could be seen as wrong. But given her own actions and the hidden information, maybe there's some context. It's a bit of a grey area. But generally, respecting her autonomy is crucial. So maybe the answer is A, he is in the wrong for pressuring her, even if her actions were questionable.\n"
