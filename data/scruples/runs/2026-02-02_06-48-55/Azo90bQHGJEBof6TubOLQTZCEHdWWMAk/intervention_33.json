Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author advising his girlfriend to get an abortion. Let's look at the key points.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend has PCOS and has been told she can't get pregnant, but it's later revealed she was pregnant before, which contradicts her statements. The author feels she misrepresented her fertility. She's been slow in the abortion process, leading to a surgical procedure with higher risks, including potential infertility. The author is stressed about their financial situation and future, and he's not ready for a child. The girlfriend uses vulgar language about the abortion and didn't reschedule the appointment, leading to her not getting the abortion and now asking the author again.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is pressuring her to abort, but in a relationship, reproductive decisions are typically mutual. However, the author is not the one carrying the pregnancy; that's on the woman. The author's arguments about their financial stability and readiness might be valid, but he's not the one facing the physical consequences. The girlfriend's delay in getting the abortion could be due to her own hesitations, and the author is upset she didn't act faster. But in many cultures, the woman has autonomy over her body. Even if the author feels wronged, he didn't force her to act, but he did express his stance. The use of \"AITA\" suggests he's conflicted, but the main issue is about respecting her bodily autonomy versus his concerns. The girlfriend's actions (not acting promptly, hiding her past pregnancy) might contribute to the conflict. However, the core of the issue is whether he's in the wrong for wanting her to abort. Since the decision to terminate is hers, and he's not the one carrying the child, he's not legally or ethically in the wrong for expressing his view. However, some might argue he's being selfish. But according to the AITA standards, the focus is on the person's actions. The author is in a difficult situation, but he hasn't done anything illegal. The girlfriend's decisions are her own. So, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
