Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted on Reddit is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend to get an abortion. The situation is complex with various factors.\n\nFirst, the couple started dating in August, and the girlfriend had mentioned she couldn't get pregnant due to PCOS. But then she became pregnant, which the author points out as a red flag because she claimed she couldn't conceive. The girlfriend also had a past pregnancy around 10 years ago that she didn't mention, which the author considers another red flag. The author is 22, and the girlfriend is 23, both in Europe, specifically Denmark where abortion laws are mentioned.\n\nThe girlfriend delayed the abortion process, leading to a surgical procedure instead of a chemical one. The author is upset about her hesitation and the potential implications for their future. He lists reasons like his busy work schedule, financial issues (she's on welfare, he can't afford more stress), and her mental health. He's not ready for a child and made that clear. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is hesitant and uses inappropriate language about killing the baby, which the author finds concerning.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for advising the abortion. Let's consider the key points. The author is not the one who can make the decision for the girlfriend; the decision to terminate a pregnancy is typically the woman's right. However, the author is expressing his stance and reasoning. He feels she's being inconsistent by claiming she can't get pregnant but then becoming pregnant, and he's frustrated by her delayed actions leading to a more invasive procedure.\n\nBut the ethical aspect here is tricky. The author is part of a relationship where both parties should have discussed their future plans, including children. The girlfriend may have misled him about her fertility issues. However, the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is ultimately hers, and the author's role is to support her decision, not to dictate it. If she's making the choice, then the author advising her isn't in the wrong in terms of decision-making, but if he's pressuring her or not respecting her autonomy, that could be problematic.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions, like delaying the process and using vulgar language, might be seen as disrespectful, but the author's response in advising an abortion could be seen as valid from his perspective. However, the fact that he's making her decision for her, even if he's not the one who legally can, might be an issue. But in many jurisdictions, the woman has the right to choose, so the author's advice is within his right to express, though he can't enforce it.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author is not in the wrong for expressing his opinion and reasons. The key is that the final decision rests with the girlfriend. The author's frustration stems from her actions and their impact on their future, but he's not the one making the decision. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
