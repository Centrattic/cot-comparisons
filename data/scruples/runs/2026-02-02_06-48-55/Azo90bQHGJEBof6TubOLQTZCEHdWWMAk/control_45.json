Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who's 22, his girlfriend is 23, in Europe (Denmark). They started dating in August, and she told him she has PCOS and can't get pregnant. She also said that if she ever did get pregnant, she'd get an abortion. But then she did get pregnant, found out two weeks ago, and now they're at the point where she's 8 weeks along, which means a surgical abortion is needed. The guy is questioning her decisions and the process she's taken, and he ends up telling her to get an abortion. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend has a history of PCOS, which can affect fertility, but she had a pregnancy 10 years ago. That might indicate that her infertility isn't absolute. The guy claims she told him she couldn't get pregnant, but she didn't have a doctor's confirmation of that. Now she's pregnant, which he sees as a problem because of their current situations\u2014his job is stressful, she's on welfare, has mental health issues, etc. He's against having a child now and wants her to have an abortion. She delayed the process, leading to a surgical abortion, which has higher risks. He feels she misused his trust by not being honest about her past pregnancy and her actual fertility status.\n\nSo, the main ethical questions here are about consent, honesty, and the decision-making in a relationship. The girlfriend didn't correct the guy's assumption about her infertility despite her past pregnancy. She also delayed the abortion process, which he sees as her not taking the situation seriously. The guy, on the other hand, is pressuring her to have an abortion based on his reasons, which include practical concerns. But does he have the right to make that decision for her, especially since it's her body?\n\nIn many societies, a woman has the right to decide about her own reproductive health. The guy's influence over her decision could be problematic. Even if they're in a relationship, the ultimate choice to terminate a pregnancy is hers. If he's pressuring her or not respecting her autonomy, that could be wrong. However, if she's making decisions that he feels are irresponsible, that's a different issue. But in this case, the guy is the one who's advocating for the abortion, which is her choice to make.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's behavior\u2014like delaying the process and using harsh language about abortion\u2014might be contributing to the tension. But the guy's main question is whether he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. If he's not respecting her autonomy or if he's making the decision for her, that could be an issue. However, if they had discussed this beforehand and she was clear about her stance, but then changed her mind or delayed, that's a different matter. But in this case, she did delay, leading to a more invasive procedure, which he's critical of. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of honesty. She told him she couldn't get pregnant, but she actually could. She also hid her past pregnancy. That could be seen as deceptive, which might affect his trust in her. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong for telling her to get an abortion. The fact that he did so might not make him wrong if she was being dishonest, but it's a complex situation.\n\nAnother angle is that the guy is taking responsibility for her by helping financially, but she's not working towards her future. He might feel that having a child now isn't feasible, which is understandable. However, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is hers alone, and pressuring her could be seen as controlling. \n\nIn conclusion, while there are valid points on both sides, the key issue is the right to make reproductive decisions. Since the guy is urging her to have an abortion, which is her choice, it's possible that he's overstepping his role. However, considering the delays and her previous dishonesty, his frustration is understandable. But ultimately, the decision to terminate should rest with her. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for trying to influence her decision in a way that disregards her autonomy.\n"
