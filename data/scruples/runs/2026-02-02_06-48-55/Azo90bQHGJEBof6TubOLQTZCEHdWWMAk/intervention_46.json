Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who asked the AITA question (the author) is in the wrong based on the situation described. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is asking for my opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author is a 22-year-old in a relationship with a 23-year-old girlfriend. They've been dating since August, and she mentioned she can't get pregnant due to PCOS. She also said she would get an abortion if ever pregnant. They found out she's pregnant two weeks ago, and she's 8 weeks along now. In Denmark, the abortion method depends on the gestational age\u2014chemical before 8 weeks, surgical after. \n\nShe delayed the process by not getting a test quickly, missing appointments, and waiting for a later gynecologist appointment. The author is concerned about their ability to support a child, mentioning work, stress, financial issues, and the girlfriend's welfare, mental health, and lack of income. She uses vulgar language about abortion, like calling it \"killing the baby,\" and there's a red flag where she lied about never being pregnant before, actually having been pregnant around 10 years ago. The author feels she's misused their trust by not disclosing her past pregnancy and being inconsistent about her ability to get pregnant.\n\nThe author advised her to get an abortion, but she hesitated, leading to the need for a surgical procedure. He's upset she didn't act quickly, which could have made it a chemical abortion. He's also frustrated with her attitude and the situation's implications for their future.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is the author in the wrong for advising the abortion? The girlfriend's autonomy is a big factor. Even if there are issues in the relationship, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is the woman's right. The author is pressuring her to have an abortion, which might infringe on her autonomy. Also, he's making assumptions about her ability to carry the pregnancy and future parenting capabilities based on her current circumstances. However, he's also concerned about their readiness and future, which is a valid perspective. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions\u2014delaying the process, not being honest about her medical history\u2014could be seen as irresponsible. But the author is now questioning her decisions and actions, which might be part of the problem. The core issue is whether advising an abortion without respecting her autonomy and the legal/medical context makes the author at fault. \n\nIn many cases, when one partner pressures the other into a decision, especially regarding a pregnancy, it's considered a violation of the woman's rights. The author might not be in the wrong if he's voicing his concerns, but if he's pressuring her to make a decision that's against her wishes, that's problematic. However, the situation is complex. The girlfriend might not be taking the situation seriously, and the author is reacting to her behavior. \n\nBut legally and ethically, the woman has the right to make decisions about her body. The author's role in pressuring her could be seen as wrong, especially if he's using the situation to control her. However, the girlfriend's dishonesty and delays might contribute to the tension. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be at fault for pressuring her to have an abortion, even if he has valid concerns. However, the girlfriend's actions also contribute to the problem. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the woman has the right to choose, and the author is influencing her decision, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. However, some might argue that his concerns about their readiness are valid. \n\nBut in the context of AITA, the focus is often on the person who asked the question. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for telling his girlfriend to get an abortion. If the girlfriend is making the final decision, then the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his opinion. However, if he's pressuring her or overriding her autonomy, that's a problem. The situation is complicated by her delays and dishonesty, but the author's main action is advising the abortion. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for expressing his position, but if he's pressuring her without respecting her autonomy, he could be. However, given the information, the answer might be B (No), because he's voicing his concerns and the final decision rests with her. But some might argue A (Yes) if he's forcing her hand. The answer depends on the nuances of their relationship and dynamics, but based on the provided info, B could be the choice.\n"
