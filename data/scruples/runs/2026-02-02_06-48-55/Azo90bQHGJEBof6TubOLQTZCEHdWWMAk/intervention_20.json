Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this Reddit post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 22-year-old guy, his girlfriend is 23. They started dating in August. She had PCOS and said she couldn't get pregnant. She also said if she did get pregnant, she'd just get an abortion. Now she's pregnant, and they found out two weeks ago. She went to the gynecologist and is 8 weeks along, so in Denmark, that means a surgical abortion. \n\nThe girlfriend delayed the process: forgot to buy a test, slept through her appointment, had to wait for a new one. The author is upset because she's been hesitant, questioning his reasons for wanting an abortion. He lists his reasons: his job is stressful, he works a lot, she's on welfare, has mental health issues, and he can't handle more stress. She keeps saying having a baby isn't stressful, which he argues against. \n\nShe used vulgar language like \"kill the baby.\" Also, she revealed she was pregnant 10 years ago, which he sees as a red flag because she claimed PCOS developed after that pregnancy but no doctor confirmed she can't get pregnant. The author never said he wanted a kid yet and explicitly said no. \n\nAt the gynecologist, she said no to the abortion and wanted to ask him again. Instead of rescheduling, she waited until last night. The author feels she misused his trust by lying about being infertile and hiding her past pregnancy. He's upset because her delay led to a surgical abortion, which has higher risks of infertility. He doesn't feel bad for her and thinks she could have done it sooner.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, should the answer be A (Yes, he's wrong) or B (No, he's not wrong)?\n\nLet me break it down. The key points are: the author pressured her to abort, she had her own reasons for delaying, her health issues, and the author's treatment of her.\n\nFirst, the author told her to get an abortion. Even though they were in a relationship and planning their future, the decision to abort is typically the woman's. The author is making a choice that affects her body. That could be seen as wrong, especially if they were in a committed relationship. \n\nShe had PCOS and said she couldn't get pregnant, but now she's pregnant. The author now says he wants a kid in the future but currently can't, so he's not ready. But he's pressuring her to abort, which may not consider her autonomy. \n\nShe delayed the process for various reasons\u2014maybe anxiety, uncertainty, or her own mental health. Using vulgar language could indicate her emotional state. The author is criticizing her for not acting faster, leading to a surgical procedure. But in some cases, women take time to process the decision, and the method depends on the pregnancy stage. \n\nShe had a past pregnancy, which the author sees as a lie about her fertility. However, PCOS doesn't make someone infertile, just makes pregnancy harder. She might have believed she couldn't get pregnant again but was wrong. The author is now upset she didn't tell him about the past pregnancy, but maybe she didn't think it was relevant or was trying to move on from it. \n\nThe author's reasoning for not being ready\u2014his job, stress, her financial situation\u2014could be valid. However, it's not his decision to make about her body. The way he's handling the situation\u2014telling her what to do, feeling no sympathy for her delay, and being critical of her\u2014might indicate he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nIn many ethical and legal contexts, the woman has the right to decide about her pregnancy. The author is pressuring her, which could be seen as wrong. However, the context includes their relationship dynamics. If they were planning to avoid children and she made that clear, but now there's a situation where they're not ready, it's a difficult decision for both. \n\nBut the key issue here is the author's actions: he's telling her to abort, using reasons that include her financial state and his inability to handle stress, which are her responsibility in a way. He's also not considering her mental health and the stress this situation is causing her. The way he's framing it as her misusing his trust by lying about her fertility might be a way to deflect from the fact that he's pressuring her to make a medical decision she's not comfortable with yet. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, I think the author may have overstepped by telling her to abort, not respecting her autonomy, and not considering her emotional state. The fact that she's hesitating and he's being critical of her process could indicate he's in the wrong. However, this is a complex situation where both parties might have valid points. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is that he's making a decision for her about her body. Even if they agreed before, the situation has changed, and her autonomy is key here. So, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's pressuring her to abort without respecting her agency and is being critical of her process.\n"
