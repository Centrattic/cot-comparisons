Add onto the fact, her initial doctors schedule was a whole week later than when she called, means she didn't call in for an immediate time (In Denmark this is possible, and is free, so no economical reason not to)\n\nThe entire time she's been hesitant about it, begins questioning my reasons (I work 24/7, I won't be there for the kid, she has no income, and I can't in my current job afford to get even more stressed out) - She kept telling me that having a baby, isn't stressful - Which to my knowledge from every parent I know - it really is.\n\nShe uses extremely vulgar language when speaking about abortion, such as 'Alright I'll just kill the baby.\n\nShe then told me, that if she gets the surgical abortion, there's a risk she can't get pregnant again - I want a kid in the future but as I am right now - I'm not able to, and frankly so don't think she is either - She lives off welfare currently, has some mental health issues, and for her money to run around, she needs a helping hand from me - Which I don't mind, as long as she works towards getting a future.\n\nShe then told me last night, that she had actually been pregnant around 10 years ago - Which was another red flag to me - Because she claims she can't get pregnant, and that the PCO kicked in after her last pregnancy, but no doctor officially told her she couldn't.\n\nNever have i said anything, that could hint towards me wanting a child *yet*, and I've explicitly told her a stern no.\n\nAt the gynecologist yesterday, she was asked if she wanted the abortion - Which she said no to, and she wanted to ask me if I still wanted her to abort, so instead of calling or texting me - She didn't reschedule, and spoke with me last night.\n\nI feel like she misused my trust, by telling me she can't get pregnant, when no doctors has said it, and hiding the fact she's been pregnant before.\n\nThe fact she is so hesitant to get an abortion, that she's been at least 2 weeks slower in the process than what she could've been, means she needs the surgical procedure, and frankly means I don't feel bad for her - Had she hurried it up a bit, she'd be done with this 2 weeks ago, with a chemical procedure.\n\nReddit.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend is pregnant, and the guy is pressuring her to get an abortion, which she initially seemed okay with but is now hesitating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and cultural context. The post mentions Denmark, where abortion is legal up to 12 weeks. Since the girlfriend is at 8 weeks, she's still within the legal timeframe. The author is frustrated because she delayed the process, going from 8 weeks to needing a surgical procedure instead of chemical. But in Denmark, the type of abortion might depend on the clinic's protocol, not just the gestational age. Some clinics might do surgical even before 8 weeks, so the delay might not be so straightforward. Also, the author is using the risk of future infertility from a surgical abortion as a point, but that's a medical consideration the girlfriend is now facing.\n\nThe girlfriend has PCOS and has been told she can't get pregnant, but she actually had a pregnancy 10 years ago. She didn't disclose that, which the author sees as a lie. However, PCOS doesn't necessarily mean infertility; it can make conception harder but not impossible. If she was told she couldn't get pregnant, maybe she was misinformed. The author might not be in the right to have assumed she couldn't conceive, but her not disclosing her past pregnancy could be a breach of trust.\n\nThe main issue is the author pressuring her to abort. Even if they had discussed this before, the girlfriend is now hesitating. The author might think he's being responsible by not wanting to take on the stress of a child with their current circumstances. However, the decision to abort is ultimately hers, and pressuring her could be seen as controlling. The use of vulgar language by the girlfriend is concerning, but it's part of her emotional state. The author's frustration with her delays might be valid if they had agreed on the course of action, but it's possible the girlfriend is conflicted now.\n\nSo, the author's actions: he explicitly told her he doesn't want a child yet, but is he wrong to encourage the abortion? If she's now having second thoughts, his insistence might not consider her change in perspective. The girlfriend's deception about her fertility could be a factor, but that doesn't necessarily justify pressuring her further. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy in this decision, especially if she's now uncertain. Also, the post comes off as dismissive of her feelings and circumstances. So the answer is A.\n"
