My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier, likes vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meals. He makes faces when eating broccoli and doesn't try new foods. She doesn't want to make two meals every day and wants to have vegetarian dishes sometimes. He ends up throwing away food she makes if he doesn't like it, which she found out about at his work. She feels like she's the asshole because she's making food he doesn't want and it's being wasted. She's trying to make him eat things he likes even if they upset her stomach, like pasta. She's also mentioned he wants to lose weight but doesn't do the gym or eat healthy.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Cooking for a partner is a common household chore. The key points here are mutual respect and communication. She's trying to eat healthier, which is her right. Her husband's behavior of discarding food without communication is problematic. She's making an effort to accommodate his preferences but is also setting boundaries by wanting to eat what she likes sometimes. The husband's lack of flexibility and the waste of food suggest he's not contributing well to the situation. \n\nShe's not forcing him to eat anything; she's making his meals and her own, but he's the one discarding hers. The fact that she's compromising by making vegetarian dishes occasionally but he's not reciprocating by trying lighter meals or not wasting food shows imbalance. The husband's accusation that she's making broccoli to watch him suffer is toxic and uncooperative. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both should meet in the middle. She's clearly stating her needs and he's not listening. His actions (throwing away food) are disrespectful. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her health and trying to avoid waste. She's made efforts to communicate, and the husband isn't responding appropriately. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
