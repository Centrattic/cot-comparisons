My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, but the husband prefers heavy meals and doesn't like trying new foods. He even throws away uneaten meals at work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is making an effort to get healthy, which is a personal goal. However, the husband's eating habits are conflicting. The key issue is whether it's reasonable to expect the author to prepare two different meals. \n\nThe husband's behavior of discarding food without telling her is problematic. Wasting food is a valid concern, and the author is trying to avoid that. But does that make her the asshole? Maybe not. She's adjusting her meals to include what he likes to prevent waste, but now he's eating things that don't agree with her, like pasta which upsets her stomach. \n\nSo, she's compromising by making meals they can both eat, but he's not being flexible. The husband's lack of willingness to try lighter meals or new foods might be the issue here. The author is trying to balance her health goals with not wasting food, which seems fair. \n\nThe husband's accusation that she's making broccoli to watch him suffer is also unkind. It's not her responsibility to force him to eat something he dislikes. She's not obligated to cook for him if he's not respectful. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could find middle ground. But given that he's not open to trying new things, her approach of making shared meals might be the best she can do. The fact that he wastes food shows he's not considering her efforts, which could make him the one at fault. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B. The author isn't in the wrong because she's making reasonable efforts to share meals and avoid waste, while the husband isn't being cooperative. His behavior is contributing to the problem more.\n"
