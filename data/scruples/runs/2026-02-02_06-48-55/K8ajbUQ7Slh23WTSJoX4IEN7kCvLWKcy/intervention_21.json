My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier, with more vegetables and less starch, while he prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. He even made a comment about her making broccoli to watch him suffer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wants to maintain a healthier diet, which is a personal choice and goal. Cooking for two people with different preferences can be challenging, especially if one person isn't willing to compromise. The husband's behavior, like throwing away food he doesn't like without telling her, seems inconsiderate. That's a problem because it's wasteful and disrespectful to the effort she's putting into cooking.\n\nThe author mentions that she's making food he will eat, even if it's not to her taste, to avoid waste. That sounds reasonable. She's trying to find a middle ground to prevent both health goals and waste. But the husband's lack of cooperation and his dismissive attitude (like the \"suffer\" comment) might be contributing to the issue. If he's not open to trying new or lighter meals, then the author is justified in not forcing herself to cook for both of them separately every day.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in a relationship, both partners should make sacrifices. But the husband hasn't shown willingness to adapt, even when the author suggested it. His actions (throwing food away) show he's not considering her efforts. The author's main issue is the waste and her own health, which are valid concerns. She's not forcing him to eat anything; she's just not catering to his preferences if it means she can't eat what she wants. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I don't think so. The husband's behavior is problematic, and the author is making a reasonable effort to meet his needs to avoid waste, but he's not reciprocating. The key points are mutual respect and willingness to compromise. Since the husband isn't cooperating and is wasteful, the author isn't the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
