My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, and her husband prefers heavy, less healthy foods. He's making faces at broccoli and not adventurous in trying new stuff. She's tried to suggest lighter options, but he doesn't follow through and even wastes food without telling her. Now she's making what he likes, even if it's not good for her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. Cooking separate meals can be time-consuming and maybe costly. The author is trying to maintain her health goals, which is reasonable. The husband's behavior of discarding food is a red flag. That shows a lack of respect for her efforts and possibly for her as a person. It's not just about the meal; wasting food is wasteful and could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe author isn't making him eat broccoli every day. She's cooking some things he likes, but when she wants a vegetarian dish, she's the one who has to deal with the aftermath of him throwing it away. That's a problem because it's the husband's choice to reject the food, not hers. The author is in a position where she's compromising her health goals to avoid waste, which isn't sustainable. If he's not willing to try new things or at least respect the food provided, the issue lies more with him. \n\nAlso, he wants to lose weight too but isn't putting in the effort to eat healthier. The author's request is for him to choose lighter meals when she's making them, which is a shared goal. But his non-cooperation and wasting food undermine that. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to eat what's good for her. She's communicating her needs, and if he's not respecting that, it's on him. \n\nMaybe there's a middle ground, like cooking one main healthy dish and a side that's easier on her stomach, or planning meals they both can eat. But the core issue is the husband's behavior and lack of consideration. The author's stance is valid. So, the answer would be B, No. She's not in the wrong.\n"
