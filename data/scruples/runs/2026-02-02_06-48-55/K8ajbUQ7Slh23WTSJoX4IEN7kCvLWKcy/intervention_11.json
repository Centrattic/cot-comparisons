My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, and her husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. He even makes faces when eating broccoli and is not adventurous. She doesn't want to make two meals and feels like she's being the asshole because she ends up making food she doesn't like or that upsets her stomach, and he ends up throwing things away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has her own dietary needs and wants to eat healthier. It's reasonable for her to want meals that suit her preferences. On the other hand, the husband doesn't like the healthier options and wastes food, which is wasteful and disrespectful. \n\nHe's accused her of making broccoli to make him suffer, which is a bit childish. The fact that he throws away food shows a lack of consideration. The author is trying to adjust her cooking to accommodate his preferences, but it's leading to her own discomfort and food waste. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not cooking separate meals? Well, she's trying to balance her own health goals with his preferences. Making two meals every day is a lot, and it's understandable that she wants a break. Also, she's concerned about waste, which is responsible. The husband's behavior seems to be the bigger issue here\u2014being uncooperative, not trying new foods, and wasting food. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because she's making a reasonable effort to cook meals that both can eat, but the husband isn't contributing or respecting her efforts. The problem lies more with his actions than hers. Therefore, the correct answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
