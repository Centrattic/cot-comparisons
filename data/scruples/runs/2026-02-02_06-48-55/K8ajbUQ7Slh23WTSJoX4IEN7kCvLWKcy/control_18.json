My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The situation is that she wants to eat healthier, her husband prefers heavy meals and doesn't like vegetables. He throws away food he doesn't care for, which upsets her. She feels she's being the asshole because of the wasted food and making meals she doesn't want to eat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasons are valid\u2014she wants to improve her health and eat foods that suit her, like vegetables. Her husband's eating habits are different, and he's resistant to trying new things. The fact that he wastes food she makes is a problem. She's trying to adjust to not make him waste food, but that means she's making meals she doesn't like, which is causing her stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's behavior is problematic. He's not open to trying healthier options, and he's wasting food, which is disrespectful and wasteful. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to cook two separate meals every day. It's a lot of work, and it's reasonable to want to eat what's best for her. She's communicated her preferences, but he's not cooperating. The husband's actions (wasting food) are more at fault here.\n\nThe key points are communication and compromise. The author tried to discuss lighter meals with him, but he's not receptive. She's now making food he likes even if it's not good for her, which is a bad situation for both. It's not her fault that he's not willing to adapt or try new things. The husband's refusal to compromise and his wastefulness are issues he needs to address. The author is justified in wanting to prioritize her health and avoid unnecessary work and waste.\n\nSo, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. She's dealing with a partner who isn't cooperative and is causing the problem by not respecting her efforts and wasting food. It's reasonable for her to want to focus on her own dietary needs without the burden of making two meals daily.\n"
