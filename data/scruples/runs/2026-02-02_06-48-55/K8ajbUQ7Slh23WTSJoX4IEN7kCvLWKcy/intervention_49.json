My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals. The author wants to eat healthier, avoids starchy veggies, and her husband prefers heavy meals. He's not adventurous with food and even throws away meals he doesn't like.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: she's trying to get healthier, avoid making meals she doesn't like, and prevent waste. She's making meals he likes even if they're not good for her. The husband isn't helping by not choosing lighter options or communicating better. He also wastes food, which she found out by accident.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, is it unreasonable for her to not cook two separate meals? It's common in relationships for one person to adjust their eating habits, but if both are making changes, it's more balanced. The husband isn't putting in effort to adapt either. He wants to lose weight but doesn't eat healthier, which is contradictory. She's making compromises by cooking meals he likes but that aren't good for her. Maybe she's not in the wrong because she's trying to maintain her health and avoid waste. Also, expecting her to cook two meals every day could be burdensome. The husband's behavior (throwing away food without telling her) adds to the problem. So, the author's stance seems reasonable. Answer B.\n"
