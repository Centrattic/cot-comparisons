My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author is a person who doesn't want to cook separate meals for her husband because she wants to eat healthier. She mentions that her husband prefers heavy, less healthy meals and gets upset when she makes something like broccoli. He even accused her of making it to watch him suffer. She also says he throws away food he doesn't like at work without telling her, which leads her to make meals he'll eat even if she doesn't like them. She feels like she's being the asshole because of this and is asking if she's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main issue is about shared responsibilities in meal preparation. In many relationships, couples either take turns cooking, cook together, or find a middle ground that works for both. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a personal goal, but it's also affecting their partner. However, the husband isn't contributing in a way that helps them both. He's resistant to trying new foods, throws away food he doesn't like, and isn't making an effort to lose weight through exercise or healthier options.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook two separate meals. On one hand, it's reasonable for her to want to eat what's good for her. On the other, she might be expected to compromise. But the husband isn't really trying to meet her halfway. He's not making efforts to eat healthier, and his behavior (throwing food away) is wasteful and inconsiderate. The author's compromise is to make meals he likes, even if they aren't good for her, leading to her not being able to eat what she wants. That seems unfair. \n\nI think the key points here are mutual responsibility and effort. If the husband isn't trying to adapt or communicate better, the author isn't entirely at fault for not cooking two meals. It's a shared responsibility, and the husband's actions are contributing to the problem. The author is trying to find a solution where there isn't much reciprocation. So, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong because the husband isn't making efforts to accommodate her needs or reduce waste. The answer would be B (No).\n"
