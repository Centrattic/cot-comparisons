My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The situation is that the husband prefers heavy meals, doesn't like vegetables, and throws away food he doesn't eat. The author wants to eat healthier and sometimes wants vegetarian dishes. They feel conflicted because they don't want to make two meals but also don't want waste.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons: they want to eat healthier, avoid making meals that make them sick, and reduce waste. The husband's behavior, like making faces at broccoli and throwing away food, isn't helpful. He's resistant to trying lighter meals and causes waste, which adds stress on the author.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and compromise. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to cook two separate meals, especially since the husband isn't cooperative. The husband's actions, like wasting food without communication, are problematic. The author is trying to balance their own health goals with the husband's preferences, and it's reasonable to seek solutions that don't involve unnecessary waste or discomfort.\n\nAlso, the husband's comment about the broccoli being to watch him suffer is dismissive and not supportive. The author is justified in wanting to eat what's better for them. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're handling a difficult situation by trying to find a middle ground, and the husband's behavior is contributing to the problem.\n"
