My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The author wants to eat healthier, especially vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meals and isn't adventurous with food. She mentioned he throws away food she makes he doesn't like, leading her to make things he'll eat even if she doesn't like them.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's position is that she's trying to eat healthier, doesn't want to cook two meals, and is frustrated with waste. Her husband isn't trying to adapt, doesn't like the food she prefers, and he's not being considerate by wasting the meals without communication. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both partners should make some effort. The husband isn't trying to eat healthier or explore new foods, which could be a problem. The author is also not making an effort to compromise by preparing different meals. However, the husband's actions of throwing away food without discussing it are disrespectful and contribute to the problem. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's trying to take care of her health and is making an effort to avoid waste by only making what he'll eat, but the husband isn't contributing to the solution. However, the fact that she's not cooking two meals might be seen as reasonable, especially if the husband isn't willing to try new things. \n\nBut maybe the author could have set boundaries or communicated better. However, given the husband's behavior of wasting food, it's understandable she's avoiding making separate meals. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. The key points are mutual consideration and communication. Since the husband isn't cooperating, the author isn't entirely at fault. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
