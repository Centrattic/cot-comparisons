My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The key points here are the dietary preferences and the resulting conflict.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier, likes vegetables, and finds her husband's food choices (burgers, steak, fries) heavy. The husband makes faces at broccoli and isn't adventurous. She doesn't want to make two meals every day and wants some vegetarian dishes. She's tried to get him to choose lighter options, but he doesn't, and he ends up throwing away what he doesn't like. Now she's making things he'll eat, even if she doesn't like them, to avoid waste. She feels she's the asshole for making food he doesn't want and causing waste, but she wants to be healthy.\n\nNow, considering whether she's in the wrong. Cooking is a shared responsibility in many relationships, but expectations can vary. The husband's behavior of throwing away food is problematic. He's not open to trying new foods and is wasteful, which adds to the problem. The author is making compromises by adjusting her cooking to his preferences, even if it's not ideal for her health. However, she's also trying to balance her own health goals. \n\nIs it fair to expect her to cook separate meals? That depends on their agreement. If they haven't discussed it and she's making an effort, but the husband is resistant and wasteful, maybe the issue is more on his side. The author is trying to find a middle ground but feels conflicted. Her main issue is the waste and her own health. The husband's unwillingness to try new foods and the waste might make him more at fault. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. She's trying to meet halfway and is being considerate to avoid waste. The husband's behavior is contributing more to the problem. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
