My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about meal preparation and differing dietary preferences between the author and her husband. The author wants to eat healthier, likes vegetables, and doesn't want to make separate meals every day. Her husband prefers heavy meals and isn't adventurous with food. There's also an issue where the husband throws away food the author makes that he doesn't like, which she found out by seeing it in the trash at his work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is trying to maintain her health goals and avoid cooking two separate meals daily. That's a common issue in relationships where people have different eating habits. On the other hand, the husband's behavior of throwing away food without telling her is problematic. That could be seen as disrespectful and wasteful. \n\nThe author mentions that she's making food he will eat to avoid waste, but that also means she's eating things that make her sick, like pasta. That's a problem because she's compromising her own health. The husband's accusation that she makes broccoli to watch him suffer is also unkind and suggests he's not being considerate.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The author has tried talking to her husband about lighter meal options, but he doesn't respond. The husband's actions of discarding food without discussion add to the problem. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to eat healthily and trying to avoid waste. It's reasonable to expect that a partner should communicate their preferences and not waste food. The husband's behavior seems to be the main issue here. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. She's trying to balance her health goals with their shared meals, while the husband isn't being cooperative or respectful of her efforts and is contributing to the problem by wasting food. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
