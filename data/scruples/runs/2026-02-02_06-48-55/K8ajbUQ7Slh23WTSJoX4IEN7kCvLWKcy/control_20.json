My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, but the husband prefers heavy, greasy foods. He even accuses her of making broccoli to see him suffer. She doesn't want to make two meals daily and sometimes wants vegetarian dishes without starch. She's tried suggesting lighter options, but he doesn't know what to pick. Also, he throws away the food she packs if he doesn't like it, leading to waste. Now she's making meals he'll eat, even if she doesn't like them, to avoid waste. She's feeling like she's the asshole for both making food he doesn't want and for it being wasted. The husband also wants to lose weight but isn't making the effort.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is whether the author is wrong for not catering to her husband's preferences in the kitchen. Let me break it down. The author wants to eat healthier, which is a personal goal. She's trying to manage her own diet, which is reasonable. The husband's behavior\u2014making faces, not trying new foods, and throwing away meals\u2014seems like he's not being cooperative or respectful. Cooking separate meals can be a lot of work, and if the husband isn't willing to try the healthier options and instead wastes them, that's a problem. But maybe the author could find a middle ground, like meals that include both healthy and heavier components so they can eat together without waste. However, the husband's actions in wasting food without telling her are inconsiderate. The author is managing her health and avoiding waste, which are valid concerns. The husband's lack of effort to eat healthier or communicate better might be the root issue here. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong. She's trying to balance her health goals and prevent waste, and the husband's actions are contributing to the problem.\n"
