My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The author doesn't want to cook separate meals because they want to eat healthier, and their husband prefers heavier, less healthy food. The husband throws away the food he doesn't like, which the author finds wasteful. The author feels like they're being the asshole by making food he doesn't want and by not allowing separate meals.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main point is about wanting to eat healthier and avoid cooking two different meals every day. That seems reasonable. It's common for people to have different dietary preferences or needs. The husband, on the other hand, doesn't seem open to trying healthier options. He makes negative comments about broccoli and throws away food, which is wasteful. The author mentions that he even threw away food without telling her, which adds to the problem.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the husband is refusing to try new things and being wasteful, then it's not entirely the author's fault. The author is trying to accommodate the husband's preferences but is also concerned about her own health and avoiding waste. She's making compromises by preparing meals the husband likes, even if they aren't good for her. The husband's behavior (throwing food away) is problematic. \n\nThe author isn't forcing the husband to eat anything; she's making food he likes, and he's choosing to throw it away. That seems to be on him. The author is also trying to find a middle ground by sometimes making vegetarian dishes but has to adjust because the husband isn't adventurous. The key point is that she's not making him eat something he doesn't want\u2014she's making what he does want, and he's the one wasting it. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband's actions contribute to the problem. The author is trying to balance her health goals with his preferences, but his behavior exacerbates the situation. So, it's not entirely the author's fault. She's in a tough spot where her husband isn't cooperating, leading to waste. Therefore, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
