My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is about meal preferences between a husband and wife. The wife wants to eat healthier and doesn't want to make separate meals, while her husband prefers heavier, less healthy food. He's been rude about her cooking, like making faces at broccoli, and even throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it. The wife feels like she's the asshole because she's avoiding making food he might waste, even if it means she's not eating what she wants. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife is trying to eat healthier, which is a personal goal. Making separate meals every day can be a lot of work, and it's understandable she doesn't want to do that. On the other hand, the husband's behavior is problematic. He's disrespectful by mocking her food choices and wasting the meals without telling her. That's not okay.\n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. The wife has tried to talk to him about lighter meals, but he doesn't engage. He's also not being responsible with the food he's given, leading to waste. The wife is making an effort to avoid wasting food by not making things he'll throw away, even if it means she's not eating her preferred meals. That seems like a reasonable adjustment given his behavior.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to meet in the middle. However, if one partner is consistently dismissive and disrespectful, the other might not be obligated to accommodate all their preferences. The husband's actions (wasting food, disrespecting her choices) are more in the wrong. The wife is trying to manage the situation by adjusting her cooking to avoid waste, which is a practical solution given his behavior.\n\nSo, the answer here is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The husband's actions are the main issue, and the wife is making reasonable efforts to address the problem without causing waste or conflict.\n"
