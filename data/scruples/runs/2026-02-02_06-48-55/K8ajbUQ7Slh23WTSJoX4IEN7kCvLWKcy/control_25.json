My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband because their dietary preferences differ. She wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, and finds her husband's heavy meals unappealing. He, on the other hand, prefers burgers, steak, etc., and even gets annoyed when she makes broccoli. She's concerned about making separate meals and food waste, but she's compromising by making things he'll eat even if she doesn't like them. The husband isn't helpful in choosing lighter meals and has wasted food before. The author feels like she's the asshole for making food he doesn't want and for the waste.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether her actions are unreasonable. Cooking for a household usually involves some compromise. However, the husband's behavior\u2014throwing away food without telling her\u2014seems inconsiderate. She's trying to eat healthier and avoid foods that make her sick. Making separate meals every day might be impractical, especially if she's the one cooking. The husband's resistance to trying new foods and his unwillingness to communicate his preferences (he says he doesn't know what to choose) adds to the problem. \n\nThe key points are: she's trying to maintain her health and avoid foods that make her unwell, she's making an effort to find common ground, and the husband is contributing to waste. The husband's accusation that she makes broccoli to make him suffer is also a red flag, indicating a lack of respect in their communication. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the husband is willing to eat the same meals as her when they're suitable, but she has to avoid things that make her sick, she's not in the wrong. The husband's behavior (wasting food, not being open to lighter meals) is more problematic. The author is trying to balance both needs without making separate meals daily, which seems reasonable. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
