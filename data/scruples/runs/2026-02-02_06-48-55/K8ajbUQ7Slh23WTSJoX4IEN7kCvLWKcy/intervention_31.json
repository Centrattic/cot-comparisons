My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the wife wants to eat healthier and avoid cooking separate meals for her husband, who prefers heavy, less healthy food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife wants to eat vegetables and healthier meals, while the husband doesn't like trying new things and complains about the food. She's making meals he'll eat, even if she doesn't like them, to avoid waste. He also sometimes throws away food without telling her, which she found out by accident.\n\nThe user initially thought the author (the wife) is in the wrong, but they're asking for my opinion. So, I need to assess if her actions are unreasonable. Cooking for two people with different dietary needs is common. It's not uncommon for couples to have to compromise on meals. The wife is trying to align her eating with her health goals, which is a valid reason. However, the husband's behavior\u2014throwing away food without communication\u2014seems disrespectful and wasteful.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect, communication, and compromise. The wife isn't forcing him to eat what she's making; she's adjusting her cooking to accommodate his preferences to prevent waste. However, the husband's lack of openness to trying healthier options and his wasteful actions could be seen as contributing to the problem. The wife's stance on not wanting to cook two separate meals is understandable, especially if she's making an effort to eat healthier. \n\nThe husband's accusation that she's making broccoli to watch him suffer is also indicative of a negative attitude, which might make it harder for her to prepare meals he dislikes. The wife is trying to avoid conflict and waste by preparing meals he'll eat, even if they aren't her preference. That shows consideration for his needs, but it's also reasonable for her to have her own dietary preferences. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both parties to find a balance. However, in this case, the husband isn't making an effort to adapt or communicate properly, leading to the wife having to adjust her meals. The husband's actions (throwing away food) are disrespectful and create a problem. The wife is trying to manage this by making meals he'll eat, but she's also expressing her need to eat healthier. \n\nSo, considering all this, the wife isn't necessarily in the wrong. Both partners might need to work on communication and compromise, but the husband's behavior seems to be the bigger issue here. Therefore, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
