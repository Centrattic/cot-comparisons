My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, and her husband prefers heavy meals. He doesn't like broccoli, makes faces, and doesn't try new foods. She doesn't want to make two meals and wants to have vegetarian dishes sometimes. The husband isn't open to lighter meals and has thrown away food she made. Now she's making things he'll eat, even if she doesn't like them, to avoid waste. She feels she's the asshole because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: she's trying to eat healthy, which is her right. Making two meals might be time-consuming and not feasible. Her husband's behavior of wasting food is problematic. He's not respecting her efforts to eat healthily and is being inconsiderate by throwing away food.\n\nThe husband's perspective: he might feel that his preferences aren't being considered. However, he's not making an effort to try healthier options or at least communicate better. His reaction to broccoli and discarding food shows a lack of cooperation and respect for her cooking, which leads to waste.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and compromise. The husband isn't trying to adapt to her needs, and she's sacrificing her preferences to accommodate his. The husband's actions (wasting food) are uncooperative and disrespectful. The author is trying to manage the situation by avoiding making food she doesn't like, which is understandable. In many relationships, both partners need to adjust. However, if one partner is making all the sacrifices, that's an issue. But in this case, the husband isn't contributing to the compromise. He's not trying new foods, not expressing willingness to adapt, and is causing waste. The author's stance is about her health and avoiding waste, which are valid. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the husband's behavior is the main problem here. The author is trying to balance her health goals with avoiding waste, which is reasonable. The husband's refusal to adapt and the food waste are his issues. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
