My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple disagreeing on meal preferences. The author wants to eat healthier and prefers vegetarian dishes, while her husband likes heavier, meat-based meals. She mentions that he throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it, and they've had issues with that. She's also making compromises, like avoiding pasta because it upsets her stomach but he likes it.\n\nSo, the question is whether she's in the wrong for not wanting to cook two separate meals. Let me break this down. In relationships, it's common for people to have different preferences, and compromise is usually expected. However, if one person's preferences are causing significant inconvenience or waste, that might tip the balance.\n\nThe husband's behavior seems problematic. Throwing away food without telling her is wasteful and disrespectful. If he's not willing to adapt or try different meals, maybe he's not contributing to the solution. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is her personal goal. If she's making meals that he's going to throw away, that's a waste of time and resources. So perhaps she's not in the wrong for wanting to avoid that. She's also adjusting her cooking to include what he likes, but when those meals don't suit her (like the pasta), she's compromising again.\n\nThe husband wants to lose weight too, but maybe he's not putting in the same effort by eating healthier. The author is trying to eat better, which is a valid reason to adjust meals. If he's not willing to reciprocate or at least be more open to trying different foods, maybe the issue isn't solely on her. So, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. She's trying to balance their needs, and the husband's actions (wasting food, not being adventurous) contribute to the problem. Therefore, the answer might be B.\n"
