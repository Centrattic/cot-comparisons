My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier, he likes heavy, less healthy food. He makes fun of her for making broccoli, he's not adventurous with food. She's tired of making two meals every day and wants to enjoy vegetarian dishes. She's tried to get him to choose lighter options, but he doesn't know what to pick. He also throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it, which she found out by visiting his work.\n\nSo, the main point is whether she's being unreasonable by not making separate meals. From what I read, she's making an effort to eat healthier, which is her personal choice. Her husband's behavior, like throwing away food and not trying new things, seems problematic. She's not forcing him to eat what she makes; if he doesn't like it, he's the one who ends up wasting it. But she's concerned about wasting food and not wanting to cook two different meals daily. \n\nI think the key here is that she's not forcing him to eat her meals. She's trying to accommodate his preferences by making things he'll eat, but he's not reciprocating. His actions of discarding food and not being open to trying healthier options might be contributing to the problem. The fact that he accuses her of making broccoli to watch him suffer is also a red flag\u2014maybe he's being a bit dramatic or resistant. \n\nHer wanting to eat healthier is a valid personal goal. If he's not willing to compromise or try new things, it's not entirely her fault. She's trying to balance both their needs but he's not pulling his weight. So in this case, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
