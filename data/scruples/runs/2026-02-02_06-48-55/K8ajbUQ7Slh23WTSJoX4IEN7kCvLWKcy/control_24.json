My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband because he doesn't like healthy food. She wants to eat vegetables and lighter meals, but he prefers heavy stuff like burgers and fried chicken. He even threw away the food she made once without telling her. Now she's making meals he'll eat, even if they don't suit her, to avoid waste. The husband also wants to lose weight but isn't making the effort.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author wants to eat healthier, husband doesn't like those foods, he wastes them, and she's compromising by making his preferred meals. The question is whether she's at fault here. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if it's unreasonable to ask the husband to eat healthier. The author has a valid health goal, and she should be able to prepare meals that support that. But it's a shared household, so maybe they should find a middle ground. The husband's behavior of throwing away food without communication is problematic. Wasting food is not good, and not discussing it with the person who cooked shows a lack of respect.\n\nThe author is trying to avoid waste by making meals he likes, but that's not her responsibility if the husband is unwilling to try new things or even makes faces. Maybe the husband is being difficult here. However, the author could be considering alternatives like batch cooking separate meals or using different ingredients. But the husband's insistence on not knowing lighter options and his wastefulness might be the bigger issue. \n\nAlso, the husband's approach to losing weight by just cooking different meals isn't healthy; he should be more active as well, but that's his choice. The author isn't forcing him to eat what she makes. She's just avoiding cooking two separate meals, which is a common issue in couples with different dietary needs. \n\nIn most cases, compromise is expected. If the husband is unwilling to try new foods or communicate his preferences better, the blame isn't entirely on the author. The fact that he wastes food without telling her adds to the problem. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband is being difficult and inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
