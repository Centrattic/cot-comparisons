My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The author wants to eat healthier, but her husband prefers heavy, less healthy foods. He's been dismissive, making faces at broccoli and throwing away food he doesn't like. The author is frustrated because she ends up making meals that she doesn't want to eat, which upsets her stomach, and she doesn't want food wasted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's behavior is problematic\u2014disrespectful comments, throwing food away without communication, not being open to healthier options. The author is trying to manage her health and avoid waste, but perhaps she's also not addressing the communication issues between them.\n\nThe key points here are communication and compromise. The author has tried to talk to him about lighter meal options, but he doesn't know what to choose. He's not engaging in the conversation meaningfully. His actions of throwing food away are wasteful and disrespectful. The author feels trapped because she's making meals that are bad for her, which affects her health goals.\n\nIs it fair to expect her to cook separate meals every day? That's a lot of work and might not be practical. However, maybe she could set boundaries or find a middle ground. The husband's unwillingness to try new foods or communicate effectively contributes to the problem. The author is not entirely in the wrong because she's making reasonable attempts to meet his needs while also trying to take care of her own health. His behavior is more in the wrong here. The author's frustration is valid given the circumstances. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
