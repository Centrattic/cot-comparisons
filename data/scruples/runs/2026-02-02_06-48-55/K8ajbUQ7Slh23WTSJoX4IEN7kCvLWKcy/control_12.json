My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The author wants to eat healthier and enjoys vegetables, while the husband prefers heavy, unhealthy food. The husband even made a comment about making broccoli to watch him suffer. The author is frustrated because they don't want to make two meals every day and want to have meals that are good for them. The husband isn't trying new foods and even wastes food he doesn't like by throwing it away.\n\nSo, the main points here are about differing dietary preferences, the effort of cooking separate meals, and the issue of food waste. The author is trying to maintain their health goals while also considering their husband's preferences. The husband's behavior of wasting food is a problem because it's wasteful and not respectful of the author's effort. \n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. If the husband is the one not cooperating, not trying new foods, and wasting food, then the author isn't at fault. The author is trying to balance their own health needs with the husband's preferences but it's causing conflict. The key here is that the husband isn't making an effort to accommodate the author's wishes, and the author is justified in not wanting to cook separate meals if it's causing waste and stress. \n\nThe husband's accusation that the author is making broccoli to watch him suffer shows a lack of understanding and consideration. The author is also concerned about food waste, which is a valid point. So, the answer should be that the author is not in the wrong. They have valid reasons for their stance, and the husband's behavior contributes to the problem.\n"
