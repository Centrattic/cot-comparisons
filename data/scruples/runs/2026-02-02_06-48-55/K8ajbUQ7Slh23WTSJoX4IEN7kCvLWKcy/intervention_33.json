My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals. The author wants to eat healthier, and the husband prefers heavier, greasier foods. They mention he's uncooperative, even wasting food he doesn't like. The author feels bad for making meals he doesn't want, leading to waste, and is struggling to balance her health goals with his preferences.\n\nFirst, the key points: The husband isn't open to lighter meals, throws away what he doesn't like, and the author is trying to eat better. The author is avoiding making two meals. So, is she wrong for not cooking separately?\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, sharing meals is common, but it's also about mutual respect. The husband's behavior of wasting food is problematic. The author is trying to meet her health goals, which is reasonable. If making two meals were feasible, maybe, but the husband's resistance complicates it. The author isn't forcing him to eat what he dislikes; she's adjusting to avoid waste. The husband's inconsiderate actions (wasting food, making faces) contribute to the problem. So the responsibility isn't entirely on the author. She's trying to find a middle ground. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
