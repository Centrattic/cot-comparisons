My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for the husband. The author wants to eat healthier, but the husband prefers heavy meals and doesn't like vegetables. The husband even accused her of making broccoli to make him suffer. Also, he throws away food he doesn't like at work, which the author found out about.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle and avoid making two different meals, which can be time-consuming and maybe wasteful. The husband, on the other hand, has his own preferences and might not be willing to try new things. But the fact that he's throwing away food she makes could be a problem. The author is making him meals, but if he's discarding them, that's wasteful and possibly disrespectful.\n\nThe author mentions that she's adjusting her cooking to what he likes, even if it's not good for her. But she's also concerned about her health. It's a common issue in relationships where people have different dietary needs or preferences. The key points here are communication and compromise. The author has tried to talk to him about lighter meals, but he isn't responsive. The husband's behavior of throwing away food without telling her is inconsiderate and could lead to more problems.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to make two meals. It's reasonable to expect that both parties can find a middle ground or agree on meals that work for both. The husband's actions of wasting food are problematic. The author is trying to avoid waste by making what he'll eat, even if it's not ideal for her. However, she might need to set boundaries or have a more serious conversation about shared responsibilities and mutual respect.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. The husband's behavior (wasting food, not being open to trying new things) is more of an issue here. The author is making an effort to accommodate him, but he's not reciprocating. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
