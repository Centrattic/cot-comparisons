My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The situation is about dietary preferences and meal planning in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier, including more vegetables. Her husband prefers heavy, less healthy foods. He's been making comments about her cooking broccoli to make him suffer, and he's not adventurous with food. She doesn't want to make two different meals every day. She's tried suggesting lighter meals, but he doesn't know what to choose. He also throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it, which she found out by visiting his work. Now she's mostly making things he'll eat, even if she doesn't like them, to avoid waste. She's conflicted because she's trying to get healthy and lose weight, while her husband also wants to lose weight but doesn't want to exercise or eat healthier.\n\nSo the main points are: the author is trying to eat healthier, her husband's eating habits are different and uncooperative, there's food waste, and she's adjusting her cooking to avoid conflict and waste. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not cooking separate meals.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it's common in relationships for partners to compromise on meals. If both are eating the same meals, they might need to find a middle ground. The husband's behavior\u2014throwing away food and making negative comments\u2014seems inconsiderate. The author is trying to accommodate his preferences to prevent waste, but it's affecting her health goals. \n\nIs it reasonable to expect her to cook two meals? It can be a lot of work, but maybe they can find meals that are healthy yet acceptable to both. However, the husband isn't making an effort to try new things or communicate better. The author's priority is her health, which is valid. The husband's inconsiderate actions (wasting food) add to the problem. \n\nIn many cases, couples split responsibilities, but cooking for one's own health needs isn't inherently wrong. The husband's lack of effort and his actions (wasting food) seem more problematic. The author isn't being unreasonable for not wanting to cook separately if there's a way to compromise. But if there's no compromise and the husband is resistant, maybe the author is right to prioritize her needs. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The husband's behavior is contributing to the problem, and the author is trying to manage both their needs while maintaining her health goals. It's reasonable for her to set boundaries and not cook two meals if it's causing stress and waste.\n"
