My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman who wants to eat healthier and prefers vegetarian meals, while her husband likes heavy, unhealthy foods. She doesn't want to cook separate meals every day. The husband doesn't like trying new foods and even throws away her meals if he doesn't like them. She's conflicted because she doesn't want to make him meals she can't eat, but she also doesn't want food to be wasted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has valid reasons for wanting to eat healthier and not having to cook two different meals. Her husband's behavior of throwing away food she made is problematic. Food waste is a big issue, and it's reasonable for her to be upset about that. She's also considering her own health, which is important.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband wants to eat his preferred foods, but he's not making an effort to try healthier options or compromise. However, it's clear that he's contributing to the problem by not communicating his preferences clearly and wasting food. The author is trying to balance both their needs, but the husband isn't reciprocating the effort. \n\nThe key points here are the husband's refusal to try new foods, his wastefulness, and the author's desire to maintain her health without the burden of constant separate meals. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's trying to find a solution that works for both of them. The husband's actions are leading to wasted food and her making meals she doesn't want to eat. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's justified in wanting to eat healthier and not have her efforts wasted. The husband is the one who needs to make changes here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
