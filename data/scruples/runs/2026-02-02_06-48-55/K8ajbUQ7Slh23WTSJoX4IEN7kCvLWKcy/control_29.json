My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe author is a person who wants to eat healthier and prefers vegetarian meals, while their husband enjoys heavier, less healthy foods like burgers and fried chicken. The author doesn't want to cook separate meals every day. The husband has a history of not liking certain foods, like broccoli, and even throws away food the author makes if he doesn't like it. The author is making meals he'll eat, even if they aren't good for them, just to prevent waste. The husband also wants to lose weight but isn't making efforts to eat healthier or exercise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common household responsibilities. In many relationships, couples share meal responsibilities. If one person is making an effort to eat healthier, it's reasonable to seek a compromise. The author is trying to avoid making two separate meals, which can be time-consuming. The husband's behavior of discarding food without discussing it is problematic. Wasting food is a sign of disrespect and lack of communication.\n\nThe author's position is understandable. They want to maintain their health goals without overburdening themselves with extra work. The husband's resistance to trying new foods and his wastefulness are issues on his part. The fact that he's not making an effort to eat healthier despite wanting to lose weight adds another layer. The author is trying to accommodate him to prevent waste, but it's leading to meals they don't like and feel unwell from.\n\nPossible solutions could include meal planning together, finding dishes that both can enjoy, or the husband making an effort to try new foods. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to avoid making separate meals, especially when the husband isn't contributing to the effort. The husband's actions (throwing away food, not being adventurous) are more indicative of his own shortcomings. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
