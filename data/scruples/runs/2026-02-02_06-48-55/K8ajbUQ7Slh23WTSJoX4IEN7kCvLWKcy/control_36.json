My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The author wants to eat healthier and loves vegetables, but the husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fries. The husband even accused the author of making broccoli to make him suffer. The author is frustrated because they don't want to make two meals every day and sometimes want a vegetarian dish without starchy veggies. They tried suggesting lighter options, but the husband doesn't know what to choose. Also, he throws away food he doesn't like at work without telling her, leading to waste. Now the author is making food he'll eat, even if she doesn't like it or it upsets her stomach, to avoid waste. The husband also wants to lose weight but isn't making efforts beyond avoiding the gym.\n\nSo, the main points are about the conflict between their dietary preferences and the effort to cook for both. The author feels they're the asshole because they're making food he doesn't want and it's getting wasted. But they're also trying to maintain their health goals. The husband's behavior of wasting food without communication is problematic. The author is making compromises, but the husband isn't contributing equally. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners should ideally find a middle ground. However, the husband's actions\u2014wasting food without communication and not trying to adapt\u2014seem to indicate he's not putting in effort. The author is making an effort to accommodate his preferences to avoid waste, even at the expense of her own health. That seems unfair. The key issue here is that the husband isn't making an effort to adjust his eating habits or communicate better. The author is not the one in the wrong because she's trying to balance her health goals with his preferences, but the husband isn't reciprocating. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
