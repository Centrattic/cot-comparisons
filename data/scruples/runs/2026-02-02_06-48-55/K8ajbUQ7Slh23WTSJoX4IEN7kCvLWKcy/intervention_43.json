My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband because of dietary preferences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, and finds it hard to avoid making two meals. Her husband doesn't like certain foods, throws away leftovers without telling her, and isn't adventurous. She feels like she's making meals that end up wasted, and she's frustrated because she can't just eat what she wants without compromising.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's actions\u2014throwing away food without communication and not contributing to meal planning\u2014could be problematic. He wants to lose weight but isn't making changes himself. However, the author is also avoiding making two meals, which is reasonable. Maybe the issue is more about communication and compromise rather than one person being entirely wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but maybe there's a middle ground. The author isn't forcing her husband to eat something he doesn't like; she's making food he'll eat and avoiding making two meals. The husband's behavior of wasting food without talking about it is disrespectful. So, maybe the author isn't wrong for prioritizing her health and trying to avoid waste. But she might need to address the husband's issues with communication and his lack of effort towards their shared goal of losing weight.\n\nIn terms of answer options, A is she's in the wrong, B she isn't. Considering the points, the author's actions seem reasonable given the husband's behavior. So the answer would be B.\n"
