My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author wants to eat healthier and prefers vegetables, while her husband likes heavy, less healthy meals. He's been making her feel like she's being cruel by making broccoli, which he doesn't like. He even throws away food he doesn't care for at work without telling her. The author is frustrated because she ends up making meals he likes but that sit on the trash, and she can't eat them. She also mentions that pasta upsets her stomach but he keeps choosing it, leading to waste.\n\nSo the question is, is she the asshole here? Let me consider both sides. On one hand, she's trying to eat healthier, which is a personal choice. It's reasonable to not want to cook entirely different meals every day. Plus, her husband is wasting food, which is a problem. On the other hand, maybe she could find a middle ground, like making dishes that incorporate both their preferences. But he's not open to trying new things and is dismissive of her efforts.\n\nThe husband's behavior (throwing food away, not being open to healthier options) seems to be part of the issue. The author isn't wrong for wanting to take care of her health or for not wanting to waste food. She's also made efforts to communicate, but he's not cooperating. His actions contribute to the problem. So it's more his fault than hers. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
