My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier and loves vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. He even made a comment about her making broccoli to watch him suffer. She doesn't want to make two separate meals each day and wants to sometimes have vegetarian dishes. She's tried suggesting lighter options, but he doesn't go for them. Also, he throws away food he doesn't like without telling her, which she found out by seeing the trash at work. Now, she's mostly making food he'll eat, even if it's not good for her, to avoid waste. She feels like she's the asshole here, but she wants to eat better.\n\nSo, the main points are about cooking preferences, health goals, food waste, and communication. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's accurate.\n\nFrom what I see, the author is trying to balance her health goals with her husband's preferences. She's made efforts to suggest lighter meals, but he's resistant. The husband's behavior of throwing away food without communication adds to the problem. The author isn't making him eat her food; she's adjusting her cooking to accommodate his preferences to prevent waste. However, she's also trying to eat healthier, so she's in a tough spot.\n\nIs it fair to expect her to cook two separate meals every day? That could be a lot of work and time. The husband's refusal to try new things and his wastefulness might be contributing to the issue. The author isn't forcing him to eat anything; she's adjusting her cooking based on his preferences. So, maybe she's not in the wrong here. The problem might stem from his behavior rather than hers. She's trying to find a middle ground, but it's not working. The husband isn't compromising either. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B\u2014she's not in the wrong. The husband's actions and lack of flexibility might be the bigger issue here. She's making reasonable efforts, and it's understandable she doesn't want to take on the extra work of cooking two meals daily.\n"
