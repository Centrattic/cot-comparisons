My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author wants to eat healthier and enjoys vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy, less healthy foods. He's made comments about her making broccoli to watch him suffer, which is pretty harsh. He doesn't try new foods and throws away meals he doesn't like without telling her. She ends up making meals he'll eat, even if they're not good for her, leading to wasted food and her health goals being compromised. \n\nSo, the key points here are mutual conflict in dietary preferences and the husband's behavior. The husband is not cooperating; he's not trying new foods, he's wasting food, and he's being dismissive. The author is trying to manage both their needs but feels it's unfair that she has to compromise her health goals just to accommodate his preferences. \n\nIs she wrong? Well, it's a shared responsibility in a relationship. If both partners have different needs, they should work together. However, the husband isn't contributing here. He's not making an effort to eat healthier or try new things, and he's being wasteful. The author is trying to balance both their needs but is clearly the one making the effort. The husband's actions (throwing food away, not trying new foods) are problematic. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's not just about her not cooking separate meals\u2014it's about the lack of cooperation from the husband. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to cook two meals if it's not mutually agreed upon. The husband's inconsiderate behavior is the main issue here. So the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
