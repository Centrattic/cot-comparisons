My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The key points here are the author's desire to eat healthier versus her husband's preference for heavy meals. She mentions that he makes faces at vegetables and isn't adventurous, leading to food waste when he throws away meals she makes. She's compromising by making meals he likes even if she doesn't, but he's not making efforts towards healthier eating.\n\nFirst, the question of responsibility. In a relationship, shared responsibilities often include cooking and eating habits. If both partners have different dietary needs, it's reasonable to expect some compromise. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a valid personal goal. However, her husband isn't reciprocating by trying to adjust his diet or at least not being wasteful. The fact that he throws away food she makes shows a lack of consideration for her efforts. \n\nBut does she have an obligation to cook for his preferences even if it goes against her own health goals? If they're both adults, they should have the autonomy to make their own dietary choices. Maybe they could agree on days where they cook for each other or opt for separate meals when necessary. The issue might be the husband's attitude and waste, not the author's refusal to cook separate meals. She's not forcing him to eat what she makes, but he's not respecting her efforts by wasting the food. \n\nAlso, she's making an effort to avoid making him meals that he'll throw away, which is understandable. So if she's already adjusting her cooking based on his preferences, but he's not making any effort to accommodate her, maybe she's not in the wrong. The husband's behavior seems more problematic here. The author isn't the one causing waste; he is. Therefore, the answer might be B, that she's not in the wrong.\n"
