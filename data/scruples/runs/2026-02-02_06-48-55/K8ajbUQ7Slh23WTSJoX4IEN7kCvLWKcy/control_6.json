My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The situation is that she wants to eat healthier and her husband prefers heavy, less healthy foods. He doesn't like vegetables, makes faces, and even throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it. She feels like she's being the asshole because she's making meals he doesn't want, leading to waste, and she's avoiding making things she doesn't like. She wants to eat healthier and lose weight, while he also wants to lose weight but isn't making effort.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are mutual expectations in a relationship regarding shared responsibilities like cooking. The husband's behavior, accusing her of making food to make him suffer, throwing away food, and not trying new things seems problematic. He's not contributing to the solution; instead, he's being resistant and wasteful. The author is trying to compromise by making meals he'll eat but it's causing her stress and possibly health issues. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not making separate meals. If they're a couple living together, it's reasonable to expect some compromise. However, the husband isn't making an effort to adapt or try healthier options, which are his own goals. The author is trying to meet his preferences but not hers, leading to her health goals being neglected. \n\nThe husband's actions (throwing away food, not communicating, refusing to try new things) are contributing to the problem. The author isn't completely at fault because she's making efforts, and her health goals are valid. The issue is a lack of mutual effort. The husband isn't doing his part to adjust, so the author isn't wrong in refusing to cook separate meals when it's causing waste and health issues for her. Therefore, the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
