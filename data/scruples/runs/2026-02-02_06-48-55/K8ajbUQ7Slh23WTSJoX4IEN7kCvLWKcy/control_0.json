My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The author wants to eat healthier, particularly vegetables, but the husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. The husband has made accusatory remarks about the broccoli, which the author finds upsetting. The author mentions that the husband throws away unliked food at work without telling her. So now she's been making meals the husband will eat, even if she doesn't want to, to avoid waste.\n\nFirst, the core issue here is shared responsibility in meal preparation. In most relationships, cooking is a shared task, but this seems like the author is the one handling it, and the husband isn't contributing. The husband's behavior of discarding food without discussion is problematic. Wasting food is generally frowned upon, and the husband's refusal to try new foods or lighter options complicates things. \n\nThe author's desire to eat healthier is valid. It's reasonable to want meals that align with personal health goals. However, if the husband isn't willing to compromise, the author might be overstepping by making meals she dislikes just to accommodate him. But the husband's actions (wasting food) are more inconsiderate. The author is left in a position where she's avoiding making her own preferred meals to prevent waste, which isn't fair to her either. \n\nThe key points are mutual compromise and communication. The husband's unwillingness to try new foods and his dismissive comments about the author's cooking (like the broccoli accusation) show a lack of flexibility and respect. The author's solution to avoid making separate meals to prevent waste is logical, but the husband's behavior is the real issue here. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It seems like she's trying to balance her health goals with the husband's preferences, but the husband isn't helping. The fact that he wastes food without telling her adds to the problem. The author isn't necessarily wrong for not wanting to cook separately, especially if it's leading to waste. However, maybe she should explore other options, like eating at different times or having a separate quick meal, but given the husband's actions, her stance is understandable. \n\nThe husband's refusal to engage in finding lighter meal options, even though he also wants to lose weight, is a contradiction. The author's efforts to accommodate him by not making her own meals might be seen as a compromise, but it shouldn't come at the cost of her own health and preferences. The husband's behavior is the main problem here, so the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals when it's clear he's not making an effort either.\n"
