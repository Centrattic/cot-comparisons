My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a woman who doesn't want to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier and loves vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meats and fast food. He gets annoyed when she makes healthier options like broccoli, and he even throws away food he doesn't like without telling her. The author feels like she's making food he doesn't want, leading to waste, and she's frustrated because she wants to eat better.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The husband doesn't like the healthier meals and is wasteful, which is clearly an issue. The author is trying to eat healthier and avoid making separate meals, which is understandable. The husband's behavior of throwing away food without telling her is a problem because it's wasteful and disrespectful. The author is making an effort to accommodate his preferences to avoid waste, but this is causing her to eat things she doesn't like, like pasta that upsets her stomach.\n\nNow, considering fairness in relationships. Both partners should compromise. The author is trying to meet his needs to avoid waste, but he isn't reciprocating by trying healthier options or communicating better. His lack of effort to eat what she makes or to discuss their dietary differences is a problem. The husband's actions (wasting food, not trying new things) are contributing to the issue. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to prioritize her health and avoid waste. She's making a reasonable request, and her husband isn't fulfilling his part of the bargain. So the responsibility isn't entirely on her. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
