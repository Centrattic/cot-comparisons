My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author doesn't want to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meals like burgers, steak, etc. He's even accused her of making broccoli to make him suffer, and he makes faces when eating it. She doesn't want to make two meals every day and sometimes wants a vegetarian dish without starchy veggies. She's asked him to pick lighter meals, but he doesn't know. When she makes something he doesn't like, he throws it away at work without telling her. She found out by visiting his work and seeing the food in the trash. Now she mostly makes food he'll eat, even if she doesn't like it or it upsets her stomach, to avoid waste. She's worried she's the asshole for making food he doesn't want and causing waste. She wants to get healthy and lose weight, and he also wants to but only if he doesn't have to exercise or eat healthier.\n\nSo the question is, is she in the wrong (A) or not (B)?\n\nFirst, let's look at the main points. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a personal goal. Her husband has different preferences. She's not making two meals, which is her choice. She's tried to ask him to pick lighter meals, but he doesn't. He's wasting food by throwing it away, which she found out about. Now she's compromising by making food he likes even if she doesn't like it, to prevent waste. She's feeling guilty about this.\n\nIs it fair for her to not want to cook two meals? In many households, sharing meals is a way to bond, but when preferences are very different, it can be a challenge. The husband's behavior of throwing away food without telling her is problematic. That's a waste and a lack of communication. The author is trying to accommodate his preferences to avoid waste, but it's causing her to eat things she doesn't like, which is affecting her health goals.\n\nThe husband's accusation that she makes broccoli to watch him suffer is a bit harsh, but maybe he's frustrated. However, the key issue here is the waste and the compromise. The author is trying to balance her health goals with the practical aspect of not making two meals. The husband's refusal to consider lighter options and his wasteful behavior seem to be the root of the problem. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to make separate meals, especially since the husband is already not eating the food she makes and wasting it. It's not her responsibility to force him to eat what she makes if he's not willing to try or if it's being wasted. She's making a reasonable effort to find a middle ground by making food he likes, but it's leading to her discomfort. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's behavior is contributing to the problem, and she's trying to adapt without forcing him to eat what he doesn't want. The answer should be B.\n"
