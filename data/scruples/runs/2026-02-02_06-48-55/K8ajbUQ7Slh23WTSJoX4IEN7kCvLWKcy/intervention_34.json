My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier, he likes heavy meals and doesn't like vegetables. He makes faces when he eats broccoli and ends up throwing away food she makes if he doesn't like it. The author is making meals he'll eat even if she doesn't like them, which upsets her stomach.\n\nHmm. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. Let me break it down. The key points are about compromise in a relationship. Cooking for each other is part of a partnership. The husband isn't open to trying new foods and is wasteful, which is a problem. But the author is not making separate meals, which she's okay with, but she's adjusting her meals to fit his preferences to avoid waste. Is that fair?\n\nThe husband's behavior of throwing away food without telling her is definitely his fault. But the author is sacrificing her diet to accommodate him. Is that wrong? Maybe she should communicate better. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. The author's actions are about her own health goals, but she's compromising to avoid conflict and waste. Since he's not trying to adjust, maybe she's not wrong to prioritize her health. So, answer B.\n"
