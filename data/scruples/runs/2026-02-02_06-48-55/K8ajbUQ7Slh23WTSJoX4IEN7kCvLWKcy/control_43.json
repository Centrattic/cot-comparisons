My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about cooking meals. The author wants to eat healthier, likes vegetables, but the husband prefers heavy meals. The husband even accused her of making broccoli to watch him suffer. He throws away food he doesn't like, which the author found out because it was in the trash at work.\n\nThe author feels like she's making meals she doesn't want, leading to waste, and she's trying to eat better. The husband wants to lose weight but isn't making changes. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Cooking is a shared responsibility in many relationships, but it's also common for people to have different dietary needs or preferences. The author is trying to align her meals with her health goals. The husband's behavior, like making faces and throwing away food, seems disrespectful and wasteful. The fact that he wastes food without telling her adds to the tension.\n\nThe author isn't forcing him to eat anything; she's trying to make meals he'll eat, even if they aren't her preference. She's also concerned about waste, which is valid. The husband's lack of effort to try new foods or make his own meals could be an issue. The author's main point is that she doesn't want to cook separate meals, which is a common issue in relationships. \n\nI think the key here is mutual respect and compromise. The husband's actions (throwing away food, not trying new things) contribute to the problem. The author is trying to manage her health and reduce waste, which isn't unreasonable. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
