My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a person who doesn't want to cook separate meals for their husband. The husband has different dietary preferences\u2014he likes heavy, maybe greasy foods like burgers, steak, etc., while the author wants to eat healthier and more vegetarian options. The husband has been wasteful, throwing away food the author made if he doesn't like it. The author is making meals he'll eat, even if the author doesn't like them, to prevent waste.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is being unreasonable. The husband is eating like a child and not trying new foods. The author is making an effort to eat healthier, which is a personal choice. The husband's behavior of throwing away food is problematic. The author has tried to communicate but the husband isn't responsive. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nIs the author obligated to cook two separate meals? That can be time-consuming and maybe costly. The husband is not considering the author's preferences and is being wasteful. The author is trying to avoid waste by making meals the husband will eat, even if it's not ideal for them. The husband also wants to lose weight but isn't making the effort, which adds to the complexity. \n\nSo, the author's main points are: wanting to eat healthier, not wanting to cook two meals, and the husband's wastefulness. The husband's points are his preference for heavy meals and not being open to changes. The author has communicated, but the husband isn't cooperating. In a relationship, mutual consideration is important. The husband isn't compromising and is causing waste, which is disrespectful. The author is trying to find a middle ground but is struggling. \n\nI think the husband is being unreasonable here. The author isn't the one in the wrong because they're making an effort to avoid waste and have tried to discuss lighter meals. The husband's unwillingness to adapt and his wastefulness are more significant issues. The author's choice to cook one meal that both can eat, even if it's not perfect for them, is a valid compromise. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
