My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier, but her husband prefers heavy meals and isn't adventurous. She mentioned he throws away food if he doesn't like it, leading her to make meals he'll eat even if she doesn't like them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is justified in wanting to eat healthier and not having to cook separate meals every day. It's a common issue in relationships where dietary preferences differ. However, the husband's behavior of wasting food by throwing it away without discussion is problematic. The author is left in a bind where she either makes food that she doesn't want to eat (and might even get sick from, like pasta) or risk having it wasted.\n\nThe key points are the author's health goals, the husband's resistance to trying new foods, and his wastefulness. The husband's actions are contributing to the problem by not communicating and wasting food. The author is trying to avoid waste but ends up compromising her own health goals. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at who is making the other person's life harder. Here, the husband's refusal to adapt and his wastefulness might shift the responsibility more onto him. The author is trying to balance both their needs, but the husband's actions are exacerbating the issue. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's in a valid position because the husband isn't contributing to finding a solution and is causing waste. Open communication and compromise are needed, but the blame isn't on her for wanting to eat healthily and avoid waste.\n"
