My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband because of their differing dietary preferences. She wants to eat healthier with more vegetables, while her husband prefers heavy meals like burgers, steak, etc. He's been making jokes or comments about her cooking, even accused her of making broccoli to make him suffer, and throws away the food she brings if he doesn't like it. The author is now making meals he'll eat, even if they're not healthy for her.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is being unreasonable. The key points here are communication, compromise, and the impact on both parties. The author mentions she's tried asking her husband to pick lighter options, but he doesn't know. He also wastes food she makes, which she finds upsetting. She's adjusting her meals to avoid waste, but that means she's eating things that don't suit her health goals or stomach.\n\nThe husband's behavior of throwing away food without telling her seems inconsiderate and wasteful. The author is trying to eat healthily and avoid making the same meals repeatedly that he doesn't like. It's reasonable for her to want to prepare food that aligns with her health goals. However, the husband's accusation that she's making broccoli to make him suffer is harsh and suggests a lack of empathy. The author isn't forcing him to eat; she's making what she wants and bringing it for him, but he's rejecting it, leading to waste.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's needs and preferences. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to eat healthier. The problem lies in the husband's inability to communicate his preferences and his wastefulness. The author is making an effort to accommodate him by preparing food he likes, but he doesn't reciprocate or respect her efforts. The husband's actions (disgusting faces, throwing away food) are unkind and contribute to the problem. The author is also trying to avoid making the same unhealthy meals repeatedly, which shows she's not entirely self-centered. \n\nSo, the husband's behavior is the main issue here. The author is not the asshole because she's expressing her own needs and trying to find a solution without forcing her preferences on him. The husband isn't respecting her efforts and is being inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
