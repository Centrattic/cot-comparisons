My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meals. He's resistant to new foods, and has thrown away her food when he didn't like it. She's been making what he likes even if she doesn't, because she doesn't want waste. She's feeling guilty for maybe being an asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide A (yes) or B (no). Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points: Both want to eat better, but their preferences conflict. The husband isn't open to healthier options, throws away food, and is uncooperative. The author is trying to compromise by making meals they can both eat, but it's leading to her eating things she doesn't like. The husband's behavior (wasting food) is a problem. The author is trying to avoid waste and get healthier.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's common for couples to share meals, but when there's a significant difference in dietary needs or preferences, it can be hard. The husband's not making an effort to try new things, and he's wasteful. The author is making an effort to find common ground, but it's not working well. She's not forcing him to eat something; he's choosing to eat or not. The fact that he wastes food is a red flag. It's his choice, but it's also a sign of disrespect towards her efforts.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for not making separate meals? Well, she's trying to avoid waste and is making meals they can both eat. If she made separate meals, she'd have to cook more, but perhaps that's a fair compromise if they both want different things. However, given that the husband is uncooperative and wasteful, maybe it's not entirely her fault. She's making an effort, but he's not. The problem lies in his behavior more than hers. She's not forcing him to eat what she makes; he's choosing to waste it. So maybe she's not in the wrong. The husband is not contributing to the solution and is causing waste, which is his issue.\n\nSo, answer B (No, she's not in the wrong). The main problem is the husband's lack of cooperation and wastefulness. The author is trying to find a middle ground, but he's not making it easier. She has a right to her dietary preferences and doesn't owe him the hassle of cooking separate meals if he's not willing to compromise or be respectful.\n"
