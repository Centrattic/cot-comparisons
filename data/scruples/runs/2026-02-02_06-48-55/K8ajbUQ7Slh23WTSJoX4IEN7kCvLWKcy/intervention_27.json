My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for not wanting to cook separate meals. They want to eat healthier, but their husband prefers heavy meals. He even accused her of making broccoli to make him suffer. She doesn't want to make two meals every day and wants to eat vegetarian sometimes. She tried suggesting lighter meals, but he doesn't go for it. Also, he throws away food she makes he doesn't like without telling her. Now she's making stuff he likes, even if she doesn't, and she's upset about the waste.\n\nHmm, so the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to decide. Let's break it down. The key points are shared responsibilities in cooking, communication, and the waste issue. \n\nIn a relationship, sharing household duties is typical. If one person is making all the meals, maybe the other should contribute. But the husband isn't trying new foods or suggesting alternatives. He's not flexible. So he's not helping out. The author is making separate meals to avoid waste, but he's throwing them away anyway. That's a problem. \n\nThe author's main issue is wanting to eat healthier and not make two meals. But if the husband keeps rejecting the food and wasting it, maybe she's stuck. However, the husband isn't doing his part in contributing to meal planning or helping with cooking. \n\nIs the author wrong for not cooking two meals? If they're both supposed to share responsibilities, maybe she's not wrong for not doing extra. The husband's behavior (wasting food) is a bigger issue. The author is trying to find a balance, but the husband isn't cooperating. \n\nSo in this scenario, the husband is not taking responsibility. The author is trying to adjust but is being forced into making meals he doesn't like, leading to waste. The author isn't wrong for wanting to eat healthier and not doing extra work. The husband's lack of effort to adjust or help is the problem. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
