My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about cooking meals. The author wants to eat healthier, with more vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. He even made fun of her for making broccoli. She doesn't want to make separate meals every day and is frustrated because he throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it. She's been making things he'll eat even if she doesn't like them, like pasta which upsets her stomach.\n\nSo the author feels she's the asshole for making food he doesn't want and leading to waste. She wants to get healthy, but he's not really trying either. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate.\n\nFirst, the husband's behavior: he's not open to trying new foods, throws away food she makes, which shows a lack of consideration. The author is trying to adjust for his preferences, even at her own expense. She's making compromises (like pasta) that disagree with her, leading to stomach issues. That's a health issue. The husband's accusation that she's making broccoli to watch him suffer is unkind and toxic.\n\nThe author's main issue is wanting to eat healthier, which is a valid goal. Making separate meals might be a hassle, but the husband's actions (disposal without communication) exacerbate the problem. The author isn't the one causing the waste; he is. She's trying to accommodate him, but he's not reciprocating. The fact that she's compromising her own health by eating pasta that upsets her shows she's sacrificing for him, which isn't fair.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's actions are the main problem here. The author is trying to balance both their needs, but the husband isn't cooperating. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
