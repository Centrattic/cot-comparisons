My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The main issue is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author wants to eat healthier with more vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy, unhealthy food. He even made a comment about her making broccoli to make him suffer. That seems mean. Also, he throws away food he doesn't like without telling her, which is wasteful. She's trying to avoid that by making what he likes, even if it's not good for her. She's also struggling with her health goals.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe she's not considering his preferences enough. But given that he's throwing food away, maybe she's not at fault for not making separate meals. The husband's behavior is problematic. He wants to lose weight but doesn't seem to follow through on healthier options. The author is trying to manage their meals without causing waste and to meet her own health goals. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's dealing with a husband who isn't cooperative and is wasteful. Her actions are reasonable to avoid conflict and waste while pursuing her health goals. Answer B.\n"
