My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband because their dietary preferences differ. The husband eats heavy, unhealthy food, and the author wants to eat healthier. The husband has even accused her of making broccoli to make him suffer, which he dislikes. He also throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it, which she found out by visiting his workplace.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to maintain a healthier lifestyle and doesn't want to prepare two different meals every day. That's a valid point. It's reasonable for someone to want to eat what's best for them, especially if they're trying to lose weight. On the other hand, the husband's behavior\u2014throwing away food without telling her\u2014seems inconsiderate. Wasting food is a problem, and if he's not communicating his preferences, that's on him. \n\nThe author has tried to compromise by making things he likes, but even then, he ends up wasting food. The fact that he doesn't want to try lighter meals or be more adventurous in his eating habits makes it harder for the author to find a middle ground. Also, the husband's comment about broccoli implying he's being forced to eat something he dislikes might be a red flag. Maybe he's not open to trying new foods or respecting her dietary choices.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's common in relationships for couples to have different eating habits. The key issue here is the husband's lack of communication and his wastefulness. The author isn't forcing him to eat the food; she's making an effort to accommodate his preferences as much as possible. However, if he's not willing to communicate his needs or respect her efforts, then the problem lies with him. \n\nThe author's desire to eat healthier is her own choice, and she shouldn't be made to feel guilty for that. The husband wants to lose weight too but isn't making the necessary changes, which is his own issue. So, in this scenario, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's actions (wasting food, not trying new things, being unappreciative) are the main problems here. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
