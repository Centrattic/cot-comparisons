My husband, however, loves heavy meals.

And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier and likes vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. He even made a comment about her making broccoli to watch him suffer. She doesn't want to make two meals every day and wants to have vegetarian dishes sometimes. Her husband doesn't try new foods and throws away his food if he doesn't like it, which she found out because she visited his work and saw the leftovers in the trash. Now she's making food he likes but that she doesn't want to eat, which upsets her stomach. She feels like she's the asshole for making him food he doesn't want and causing waste, while she wants to get healthy.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are about shared responsibilities in a household and mutual consideration. Cooking is typically a shared responsibility, but in this case, the husband isn't contributing to making healthier meals. He's resistant to trying new foods and ends up wasting the food she makes. She's compromising by making meals he likes but that aren't good for her. \n\nThe husband's behavior of throwing away food she made is problematic. Waste is a big issue, and it's not his responsibility to make her feel guilty by discarding the food. The fact that he's not open to trying lighter meals despite her requests suggests he's not contributing to the solution. She's trying to manage both their needs, but his actions are causing waste and making her compromise her health goals.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could have set boundaries earlier. For example, maybe she should have stopped making meals he throws away to force him to eat what's prepared or not. But given that he throws it away without telling her, that's his issue. She's trying to accommodate him but he's not reciprocating. \n\nHer wanting to eat healthier isn't unreasonable. If he wants to eat heavier meals, maybe he should prepare his own meals. But in a shared household, some compromise is expected. However, since he's not making an effort and is causing waste, the responsibility isn't entirely hers. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's trying to balance both their needs but the husband's inconsiderate actions (throwing food away) make him the problematic one. She's not wrong for wanting to eat healthily and not wanting to waste food. Her husband's behavior is more to blame here.\n"
