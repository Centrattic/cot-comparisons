My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The author doesn't want to cook separate meals for her husband because he prefers heavy meals while she wants to eat healthier. Her husband throws away the food she makes if he doesn't like it, and she ends up eating things that upset her stomach.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a valid personal goal. Making separate meals every day could be time-consuming and maybe costly. She's also concerned about food waste when he throws away the food. On the other hand, her husband's habits are problematic\u2014he's not open to trying new foods, doesn't communicate his preferences well, and wastes food. He's supposed to lose weight too but isn't taking action beyond not going to the gym.\n\nThe key points here: The author isn't forcing her husband to eat something he dislikes. She's making meals she wants, but he's the one discarding the food. However, she's compromising by making things he likes even if they're not good for her. The husband's behavior of wasting food is definitely a problem. The author's desire to eat healthier and avoid making two meals isn't unreasonable, especially if there's no agreement on shared meals.\n\nBut wait, are they sharing meals together? If they eat together, she might need to find a middle ground. If not, maybe it's easier. The husband's refusal to try lighter meals and his wastefulness seem like his main issues. The author is left in a tough spot where she's sacrificing her health goals to avoid waste. Maybe the husband isn't taking responsibility for his own food choices. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband is the one wasting food by throwing it away. The author is trying to avoid that, so she's adjusting her cooking. But she's also compromising her own health goals. There's a balance needed here. The author's actions aren't malicious; she's trying to take care of her health and prevent waste. The husband's behavior is more problematic because he's not contributing to finding a solution and is being wasteful. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's actions are more to blame. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
