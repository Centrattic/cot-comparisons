My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about meal preferences between a husband and wife. The woman wants to eat healthier, like vegetables, while the husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. She doesn't want to cook two different meals each day and is frustrated because he throws away the food she makes if he doesn't like it. He also doesn't try new foods. She's making meals he'll eat even if she doesn't like them, and now she's questioning if she's the asshole for this.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are about compromise, communication, and mutual effort in a relationship. \n\nShe's making an effort to eat healthier, which is her personal goal. The husband, on the other hand, has his own preferences and isn't open to trying lighter options. There's a lack of communication because she mentioned she's asked him to pick lighter meals, but he doesn't know. Also, he's wasteful by throwing away food she prepares without discussing it. \n\nThe woman is avoiding making two meals to prevent waste and because she doesn't want the food to go to waste. However, she's now cooking meals that she dislikes to accommodate him, which seems unfair. The husband isn't showing effort to adapt or communicate his preferences better. He's also not trying to meet her halfway, like incorporating some healthier options or being more adventurous with food.\n\nIn relationships, it's expected that both parties make compromises. If she's the only one compromising and he's not making any effort, that's an imbalance. The husband's behavior of wasting food is also inconsiderate. So, the woman might not be in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals every day. Instead, the husband's lack of flexibility and communication could be the main issues here. \n\nHowever, there's a point where she's prioritizing his preferences over her health goals. But since he's resistant to change, maybe she's justified in setting boundaries. The question is whether it's her responsibility to accommodate his preferences entirely. Typically, in such situations, both partners should work together. Since the husband isn't showing any effort, the woman is not necessarily in the wrong for not continuing to make meals she dislikes just to avoid waste. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The husband's actions and lack of cooperation are contributing to the problem, and the woman is making reasonable efforts to balance the situation without causing waste or compromising her health goals entirely.\n"
