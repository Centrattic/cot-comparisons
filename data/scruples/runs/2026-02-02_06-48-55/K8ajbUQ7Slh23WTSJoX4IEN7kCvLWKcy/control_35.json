My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier and loves vegetables. Her husband prefers heavy meals like burgers, steak, fried chicken, etc. There's some tension here. He accused her of making broccoli to watch him suffer, which seems mean. He also doesn't try new foods and throws away leftovers if he doesn't like them. Now she's making food he'll eat even if she doesn't want to, leading to her making things she can't eat, which makes her sick. She's frustrated because she wants to eat healthier, lose weight, and she feels like she's the asshole for causing waste or making meals he doesn't like.\n\nSo, the main points are: she's trying to eat healthier, he's resistant to new foods, he wastes food without telling her, and she's compromising to the point where she's eating things that upset her stomach. The user is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Typically, in relationships, sharing responsibilities is expected. But cooking meals can be a personal choice. If she's the one cooking and feels it's a burden, then maybe it's not her fault. She's trying to prioritize her health, which is understandable. However, expecting one person to cook for another's preferences without compromise might be an issue. But the husband's behavior\u2014throwing away food, not trying new things, and being dismissive\u2014seems problematic. Also, he's not making an effort towards health goals despite wanting to lose weight, which adds to the imbalance.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is obligated to cook separate meals. If both partners are contributing to meal planning and cooking, then not cooking for each other's preferences could be an issue. But if the author is the sole cook and isn't getting support from her husband, then she's not in the wrong. Additionally, the husband's wasteful behavior shows a lack of consideration. So, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the husband isn't being cooperative or respectful, and the author has a valid reason to prioritize her health and avoid waste.\n"
