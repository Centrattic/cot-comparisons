My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The author wants to eat healthier, specifically with vegetables, while the husband prefers heavier, less healthy meals. The husband has been making comments and even threw away food the author made that he didn't like. The author feels like they're making meals they don't enjoy, leading to potential waste.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to follow a healthier lifestyle, which is a common goal. It's reasonable for someone to want to eat what's good for them. However, the husband's preferences are different, and there's a conflict here about meal preparation. The author is making the husband's meals to avoid waste, but ends up eating things they don't like, which isn't fair. The husband's behavior of throwing away food is problematic because it shows disrespect and waste, which adds to the problem.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals. From what's described, the author is making an effort to accommodate the husband's preferences to avoid waste, but this is causing the author to eat things they don't like and might even make them sick. The husband isn't being cooperative either; he doesn't try new foods and doesn't communicate his preferences properly. The fact that he wastes food by throwing it away without telling her is a big issue because it's inconsiderate and wasteful.\n\nSo, the author is trying to find a balance but is being forced into a situation where they have to eat unappetizing food. The husband's actions are contributing to the problem. In a healthy relationship, both partners should make compromises. Since the husband isn't making an effort to try new things or communicate better, the blame isn't entirely on the author. The author is justified in wanting to eat healthier and not having to cook for two different diets all the time. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
