My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband because of their different dietary preferences. She wants to eat healthier, with more vegetables, while her husband prefers heavy, less healthy meals. He's even been wasteful, throwing away food she made if he doesn't like it. The author is conflicted because she doesn't want to make two meals every day and feels like she's being the asshole if she makes something he doesn't want, which might lead to waste. But she also wants to eat better and lose weight.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. From what I see, the main points are about differing dietary needs and the husband's behavior regarding food waste. The author is trying to take care of her health, which is a valid reason. The husband's actions, like throwing away food without telling her and not being open to trying new things, seem problematic. The author is making an effort to find meals that they can both eat, but the husband isn't cooperating. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is at fault for not catering to her husband's preferences when it's causing her to compromise her health goals. The husband's refusal to eat lighter meals and the resulting waste might be his own issue. The author isn't forcing him to eat anything; she's just trying to avoid making separate meals. Also, the husband's accusation that she's making broccoli to make him suffer is childish and not a good reason to dismiss her needs. \n\nIn many relationships, couples adjust to each other's preferences. However, when one person's habits are causing waste or making the other person uncomfortable, it's reasonable for the other to set boundaries. The author is trying to find a middle ground, so she's not in the wrong. The husband needs to either be more flexible or find his own meals if necessary. So the answer is B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
