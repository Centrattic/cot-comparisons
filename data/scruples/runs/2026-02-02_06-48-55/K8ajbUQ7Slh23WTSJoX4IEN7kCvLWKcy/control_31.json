My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the problem again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe author is a person who wants to eat healthier and prefers vegetarian meals with lots of vegetables. Their husband, on the other hand, likes heavy, non-vegetarian foods like burgers and fried chicken. The husband has made comments about the broccoli, making faces and even accusing the author of making it to watch him suffer. The husband also doesn't like trying new foods and sometimes throws away the food the author makes if he doesn't like it. The author is now making meals he'll eat, even if they're not healthy for the author, to prevent waste. The author feels like they're the asshole for either making food he doesn't want or having it wasted. They want to get healthier and lose weight but the husband isn't making efforts either.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals. The options are A (Yes, they're wrong) or B (No, they're not). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author is trying to maintain a healthier diet and is making an effort to avoid waste. The husband, however, is not open to trying new foods and is even wasteful with the food provided. The author is compromising by making meals the husband will eat, even if they're not ideal for their own health. The husband isn't contributing to this effort, as he doesn't want to eat healthier or try new things. He's also been dismissive and even a bit hostile towards the author's preferences, leading to wasted food. \n\nIn many relationships, sharing meals is common, but there's also the expectation that both parties can make some effort. However, in this case, the husband isn't making an effort to adapt or compromise. The author is trying to balance both their needs but is being forced to make unhealthy choices to avoid waste. The husband's behavior\u2014throwing food away without telling the author\u2014seems inconsiderate and disrespectful. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and compromise. The author is being reasonable by wanting to eat healthier and not make separate meals all the time. The husband's resistance to trying new foods and his wastefulness are problematic. The author's actions are justified as a way to manage the situation without causing waste, even if it means occasionally eating food that's not ideal for them. The husband's behavior is contributing to the problem, so the author isn't the one at fault here. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
