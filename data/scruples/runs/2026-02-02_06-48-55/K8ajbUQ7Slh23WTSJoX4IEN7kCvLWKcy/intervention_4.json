My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals. The author wants to eat healthier, but her husband likes heavy meals and isn't adventurous. She doesn't want to make two meals every day. She mentioned that he throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it, which she found out by visiting his work. Now she's making things he'll eat, even if she doesn't like them because she doesn't want food to be wasted. She feels like she's the asshole because she's making food he doesn't want and it's getting wasted. She also mentions that he wants to lose weight but doesn't seem to take it seriously.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no. I need to consider both sides. \n\nFirst, the husband's behavior: he's being uncooperative in eating healthier, throwing away food she makes. That's wasteful and disrespectful. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a personal choice. Making two meals every day can be burdensome, and she's trying to avoid that. She's also considering the husband's preferences but it's leading to her not getting the meals she wants. \n\nBut wait, she's making food he likes even if she doesn't like it, which might be affecting her health goals. However, she's the one who wants to eat healthier, so maybe she should find a way to compromise. But the husband isn't helping\u2014his not eating the food and wasting it is part of the problem. \n\nIs she in the wrong for not wanting to cook two meals? Well, it's her home, and she has the right to choose what she eats. If he's not willing to compromise, maybe she's justified in setting boundaries. On the other hand, maybe she should try to find meals that are both healthy and acceptable to him. But given his resistance (making faces, not trying new things, throwing away food), maybe it's unreasonable to expect her to cook for both of their preferences. \n\nAlso, the husband's comment about making broccoli to watch him suffer is pretty unkind. That shows he's not being considerate either. The author is trying to balance her health goals with his preferences, but he's not contributing to the solution. So, in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to manage her own health and reduce waste, while the husband is not cooperating. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
