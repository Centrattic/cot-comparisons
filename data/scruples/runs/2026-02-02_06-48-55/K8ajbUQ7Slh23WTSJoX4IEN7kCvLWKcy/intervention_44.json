My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier, prefers vegetables, and he likes heavier, less healthy foods. He even made a comment about her making broccoli to make him suffer. She mentions he doesn't try new things and wastes food when he doesn't like it. She feels like she's being the asshole because she's making food he doesn't want, which might get wasted, but she's also trying to eat better.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are her desire to eat healthier, the husband's reluctance to try new foods, and the issue of food waste. She's trying to balance her health goals with their shared meals. The husband's behavior, like throwing away food without telling her, is problematic. That's a sign of disrespect and waste, which is on him. She's making an effort to accommodate his preferences to avoid waste, but it's causing her to compromise her diet.\n\nThe question is whether she's wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals. Cooking for two people can be a shared responsibility, but in this case, the husband isn't contributing equally. He's not open to healthier options and is wasting food, which adds to the problem. The author is trying to maintain her health goals, which is reasonable. It's not her fault that he's resistant to change or respectful meal habits. So, she's not the one in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
