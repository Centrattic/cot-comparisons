My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, and wants to lose weight. Her husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and steak. He's made sarcastic comments about her cooking broccoli and makes faces, which is unkind. He also doesn't try new foods and ends up throwing away the food she makes if he doesn't like it. The author is frustrated because she ends up making meals he'll eat, even if they're not good for her, to avoid waste. She feels like she's the asshole for making food he doesn't want and for the waste that happens when she does try something he doesn't like.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The husband's behavior seems problematic. He's dismissive of her efforts, doesn't try to adapt, and wastes food. The author is trying to meet his preferences but it's conflicting with her health goals. The issue is about compromise. In a relationship, both partners usually need to find a middle ground. However, the husband isn't making an effort to adjust his diet or communicate better. The waste of food is also on him since he throws it away without talking to her. The author is trying to avoid waste by making what he'll eat, even if it's bad for her. That seems like she's accommodating his preferences at her own expense, which isn't fair. The husband's lack of effort and the waste are his issues. So, the author isn't wrong for wanting to eat healthier and not cook separate meals when he's not contributing to the solution. Therefore, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
