My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The author wants to eat healthier, prefers vegetables, and their husband loves heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. The husband is resistant to new foods and even throws away uneaten food at work, which the author found out about.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to maintain a healthier lifestyle, which is a personal health goal. It's reasonable for someone to want to eat what's best for them. However, the husband's eating habits are different, and he's not open to trying new or lighter meals. This creates a conflict in meal preparation.\n\nThe author mentions that they've tried suggesting lighter options, but the husband isn't interested. The husband's behavior of throwing away disliked food is problematic because it's wasteful and shows a lack of consideration for the effort the author puts into cooking. The author is now making meals he likes, even if it upsets the author's stomach, to avoid waste. This seems like a compromise, but it's not working well because the husband isn't contributing to finding a solution.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband's refusal to try new foods and his wastefulness might make him more at fault. The author is trying to balance their own health goals with their partner's preferences, but the husband isn't cooperating. The key points are the author's right to eat healthily, the husband's resistance to change, and the waste of food. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own health and avoiding waste. They are seeking a balance that works for both, but the husband's actions (wasting food, not trying new options) are the main issues here. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
