My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is a person who doesn't want to cook separate meals for their husband. The husband likes heavy, unhealthy foods, and the author wants to eat healthier, like vegetables. The husband throws away uneaten food, and the author feels like they're the asshole for not making food he doesn't like and for the wasted food.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wants to eat healthily, which is reasonable. Cooking separate meals every day could be a lot of work. On the other hand, the husband is eating the same heavy meals and not being adventurous. The author mentions that the husband throws away food, which is wasteful. The author is trying to avoid that by making things the husband will eat, even if the author doesn't like them. The husband also wants to lose weight but doesn't commit to healthier options.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Is it fair for the author to not have to cook two different meals? Maybe there's a middle ground. The author could try finding meals that both can enjoy, or maybe the husband could take responsibility for his own meals sometimes. However, the husband's behavior of throwing away food without communication is inconsiderate. The author is trying to prevent waste by adjusting their cooking, which seems fair. The husband isn't helping with the solution, like trying new foods or eating leftovers. The author's desire to eat healthily is a personal choice, and it's reasonable to not want to compromise on their own health. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. The husband's actions and lack of flexibility are contributing to the problem. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
