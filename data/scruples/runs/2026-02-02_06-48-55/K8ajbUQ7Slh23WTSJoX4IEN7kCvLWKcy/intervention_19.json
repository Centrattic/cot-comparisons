My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves the author not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband because of dietary preferences and differences. The husband eats heavy, unhealthy food, and the author wants to eat healthier, like vegetables. The husband throws away food he doesn't like, leading to waste. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: she's trying to eat healthier, avoid cooking things she doesn't want, and prevent food waste. The husband's perspective: he has different tastes, throws away food, and might not be flexible. The author is making meals he likes, which might not align with her health goals. The husband's behavior of throwing away food is problematic because it's wasteful and disrespectful. The author is trying to balance her needs without making two separate meals, which is a common issue in relationships.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, not making two separate meals isn't unreasonable. The husband's actions (throwing away food) are more concerning. The author is compromising by making what he likes, even if it's not ideal for her. She's also trying to communicate her needs but he's not responding. The husband's lack of effort to adapt or try healthier options might be the bigger issue here. The author isn't forcing him to eat something; she's making what he prefers, but he's still wasting food. So, the husband's actions are more in the wrong. The author is trying to manage her health and reduce waste, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
