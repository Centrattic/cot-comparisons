My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The main points are about dietary preferences and the husband's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier, like vegetables, but the husband prefers heavy, unhealthy foods. The husband has been dismissive and even wasteful with the food, throwing it away without telling. The author feels they're the bad guy because they might make meals the husband doesn't want, leading to waste. But they're also making an effort to avoid making food that upsets their stomach.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, everyone has the right to eat what they prefer. The husband's behavior\u2014mocking the food, throwing it away\u2014is problematic. The author isn't forcing him to eat it; they're just making what they want. The husband's actions contribute to the problem. The author is trying to avoid waste by making meals both can eat, which seems reasonable. The husband's lack of effort to adapt or communicate is an issue. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to balance their health goals without forcing their partner to comply. The husband's behavior is more to blame here.\n"
