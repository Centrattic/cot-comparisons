My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The author wants to eat healthier and prefers vegetarian dishes, but their husband likes heavy, unhealthy foods. They mention that he doesn't like vegetables, sometimes throws away food without telling them, and they end up making foods that he likes even if it makes the author uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is trying to maintain a healthier lifestyle, which is a personal choice. It's reasonable for someone to want to eat what's good for them. On the other hand, the husband's preferences are different, and he's not open to trying new or lighter meals. The author is struggling with the idea of making two separate meals, which can be time-consuming and maybe costly.\n\nThe husband's behavior, like throwing away food without discussion, seems like a problem. The author is making compromises by preparing meals they don't like to avoid waste, but this is causing them stress. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable by not cooking two separate meals. In relationships, it's common for couples to find a middle ground, but if one partner's needs are causing significant distress, it's a valid concern.\n\nThe author isn't forcing their husband to eat anything; they're trying to eat healthier, which is their right. The husband's lack of willingness to try new foods or communicate about the issue might be the bigger problem. The author's decision to prioritize their health and not want to cook for two different tastes separately isn't necessarily wrong. So, it seems like the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
