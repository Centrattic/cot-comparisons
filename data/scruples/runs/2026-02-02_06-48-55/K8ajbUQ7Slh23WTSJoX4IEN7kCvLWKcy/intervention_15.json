My husband, however, loves heavy meals.

And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, and her husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. There's a mention that the husband once accused her of making broccoli to watch him suffer, and he makes faces when eating it. He isn't adventurous with food. The author doesn't want to make two meals every day and sometimes wants a vegetarian dish without starchy veggies. She's tried to get him to pick lighter options, but he doesn't know what to choose. Also, he throws away food he doesn't like at work without telling her, which she found out by accident. Now she's making things he'll eat, even if she doesn't like them, to prevent waste. She feels like she's the asshole for making food he doesn't want and causing waste, but she wants to get healthy and lose weight. The husband also wants to lose weight but doesn't want to go to the gym or eat healthier.\n\nSo the main points are: the author is struggling with cooking for both their preferences, the husband isn't open to healthier options, and there's an issue with food waste. The author feels like she's in the wrong for not making separate meals, but maybe she's not? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the husband's behavior: he accuses her of sadism over broccoli, throws away food without communication, and isn't trying new foods. That seems like he's not considering her efforts and is being dismissive. The author is trying to make balanced meals, but he's not cooperating. She's making compromises, but he's not. Also, she's trying to eat healthier, which is her personal health goal. Should she have to accommodate his preferences every time? It seems like he's not making an effort either, which could be part of the problem.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The author is making an effort to find meals they can both eat, but the husband's lack of effort and the food waste issue might shift responsibility. If she's making food he doesn't like and he throws it away, that's a problem. But she's also trying to eat healthier, which is valid. Maybe a middle ground is needed, like agreeing on some meals where she can have her vegetarian dishes and he can have his, or maybe he can pack his own food when he's not eating what she makes. But the husband isn't trying to adapt, so maybe the author is justified in not making separate meals, especially since he's not reciprocating.\n\nSo in terms of right or wrong, the husband's behavior (throwing food away, not trying new things) is problematic, and the author is trying to find a solution. The question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's making an effort to find common ground and he's not, and the food waste is his fault, the author might not be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
