My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The setup is that the author (a woman) doesn't want to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier, but her husband prefers heavy, less healthy foods. He's been dismissive, even accusing her of making broccoli to make him suffer. She mentions that he throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it, which she found out by visiting his work. Now she's making meals he'll eat, even if they upset her stomach, to avoid waste. She feels she's the asshole for making food he doesn't want and for wasting it. She's trying to get healthy, while her husband also wants to lose weight but isn't putting in the effort.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. In relationships, sharing responsibilities like cooking can be a point of contention. The key here is that the author is trying to maintain her health goals, which is reasonable. However, the husband's behavior\u2014throwing away food and not being open to trying new or healthier options\u2014seems problematic. \n\nThe author is making an effort to avoid waste by cooking meals he'll eat, even if they don't suit her. But she's compromising her own preferences for his. Is that wrong? Well, it's common for couples to find a middle ground. If both partners have different dietary needs, compromise is necessary. However, in this case, the husband is not contributing to the effort. He's resistant to trying new foods and even wasteful, which adds to the problem. The author is not forcing him to eat anything; she's trying to avoid conflict and waste. \n\nThe husband's accusation that she's making broccoli to make him suffer is a red flag. That's dismissive and rude. The author's issue is that she's not in the wrong for wanting to cook food that suits her, especially when he's not respecting her efforts by eating what's made or at least not wasting it. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because she's making a reasonable request to eat healthily and avoid waste. The husband's actions (wasting food, not being open to trying new things) are contributing to the problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
