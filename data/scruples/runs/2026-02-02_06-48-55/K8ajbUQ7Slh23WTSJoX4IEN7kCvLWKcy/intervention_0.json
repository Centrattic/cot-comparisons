My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The author wants to eat healthier, but her husband prefers heavy, unhealthy meals. He's resistant to trying new foods and even wastes food by throwing it away at work. The author feels like she's making meals she doesn't want to eat just to avoid waste, but she's questioning if she's the asshole for not cooking separately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's husband doesn't like healthy food and ends up wasting it. The author is compromising by making meals he likes even if they're not good for her. But she's also not making separate meals, which she feels is too much effort. The husband's behavior of throwing away food is problematic because it's wasteful and disrespectful. \n\nIn relationships, it's common for couples to find a middle ground. Maybe the husband isn't trying enough to eat healthier, and the author isn't trying to accommodate his preferences either. But the key here is the husband's refusal to try new things and the waste. The author is making an effort to avoid waste by not cooking separate meals, even though it's not ideal for her. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the husband isn't being considerate either. It's a two-way street. The husband's actions (wasting food, not making an effort) are more inconsiderate. The author is trying to manage both their health goals but is stuck because he's not cooperating. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
