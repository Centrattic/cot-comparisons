My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The husband has different food preferences\u2014he likes heavy, less healthy meals, and the author wants to eat healthier, like vegetables. The husband even accused her of making broccoli to make him suffer, which is pretty harsh. Also, he throws away food he doesn't like at work without telling her, leading to waste.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and compromise. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a valid personal goal. The husband's behavior\u2014disparaging her food choices and wasting food\u2014is problematic. However, the author is making meals that the husband likes, even if they don't align with her health goals, to avoid waste. That shows some consideration for his preferences, but it's not a sustainable solution if she's not getting her needs met.\n\nIn a relationship, both partners should make compromises. The husband's refusal to try lighter meals and his wastefulness are significant issues. The author isn't entirely at fault here because she's trying to balance both their needs. The husband's actions (wasting food, being uncooperative) are more in the wrong. So, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her health and avoiding unnecessary conflict over food choices.\n"
