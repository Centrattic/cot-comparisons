My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author, a woman, doesn't want to cook separate meals because she wants to eat healthier. Her husband likes heavy, less healthy food and doesn't try new things. He's even thrown food away at work when he didn't like it. She feels she's being the asshole by making meals he doesn't want, which leads to waste, but she's also trying to eat better.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The husband's behavior is problematic. He's not open to trying healthier options and is wasteful by discarding food. The author is trying to manage both her health goals and avoiding waste, which is reasonable. Cooking separate meals every day can be a hassle, and it's understandable she wants to avoid that. The husband's lack of cooperation and the fact that he wastes food when he doesn't like it suggests he's not contributing to the solution.\n\nThe key points are: the husband's resistance to changing his diet, his wastefulness, and the author's efforts to balance both their needs without making separate meals. The author isn't in the wrong because she's trying to meet her health goals and prevent food waste. The husband's actions (not trying new foods, wasting) are part of the problem. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
