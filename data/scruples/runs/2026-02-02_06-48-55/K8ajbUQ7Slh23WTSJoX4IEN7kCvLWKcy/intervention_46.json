My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about cooking meals. The author wants to eat healthier, but her husband prefers heavy, less healthy food. She doesn't want to make two separate meals every day, but he ends up not liking the healthier options, makes faces, and even throws away the food she packs for him. She's now making food he likes, even if she doesn't, to avoid waste. She feels like she's the asshole because she's making him food he doesn't want and it's getting wasted. But she wants to eat better.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's behavior\u2014making faces, throwing away food without telling her, not being open to trying new things\u2014is problematic. That's disrespectful and wasteful. The author is trying to compromise by making food he likes, even if it's not ideal for her health goals. She's also trying to avoid waste, which is responsible. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. She's not forcing him to eat anything; she's trying to accommodate his preferences to avoid conflict and waste. However, she's sacrificing her own health goals because he's not willing to adjust. The husband isn't meeting her halfway. He wants to lose weight but isn't making changes. The author's stance is about her right to eat healthier and not have her efforts wasted. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe she could find a middle ground. But the husband's actions (throwing food away) are clearly wrong. The author isn't at fault for not wanting to cook separate meals if he's not willing to try healthier options. She's being reasonable in her request but he's not cooperating. So, the problem lies more with the husband. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
