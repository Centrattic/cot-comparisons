My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband because of differing dietary preferences.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The author wants to eat healthier and prefers vegetables, while the husband likes heavy meals like burgers and fries. The husband even accused the author of making broccoli to make him suffer. He throws away food he doesn't like at work without telling her, which is wasteful. The author now makes meals he'll eat, even if she doesn't like them, to avoid waste. She's trying to get healthy, but the husband isn't making changes.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are: different dietary needs, responsibility in meal preparation, food waste, and communication.\n\nIn relationships, it's common for partners to have different preferences. The author is trying to accommodate the husband by making meals he likes, even if they aren't her ideal. However, the husband isn't reciprocating by trying to eat healthier, despite also wanting to lose weight. He's also contributing to food waste by discarding uneaten meals. The author is not forcing him to eat what she makes; she's adjusting to his preferences to avoid waste. \n\nThe husband's behavior\u2014disgust faces, throwing food away\u2014seems disrespectful and inconsiderate. The author's action of making meals he'll eat is a compromise. The fact that the husband doesn't want to make changes (like going to the gym or eating healthier) suggests he's not taking shared responsibility. \n\nIs it fair for the author to expect not having to cook separate meals? Yes, unless there's a medical reason. The author is making an effort to avoid waste, which is responsible. The husband's refusal to adapt and his wastefulness are issues. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain her health goals and not wanting to cook separately every day. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong). The husband's behavior is more problematic here. The author is trying to find a middle ground, while the husband isn't cooperating and is causing waste.\n"
