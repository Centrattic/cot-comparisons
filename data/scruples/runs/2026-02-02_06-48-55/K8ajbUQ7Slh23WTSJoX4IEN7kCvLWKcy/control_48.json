My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. He makes faces at broccoli and throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it. She feels like she's the asshole for making him food he doesn't want and for the food getting wasted.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a personal goal. She's making an effort, but her husband's preferences are conflicting. He isn't open to trying new foods and is wasteful. The key points here are mutual respect and compromise in a relationship. \n\nThe husband's behavior is problematic. He accuses her of being mean for making broccoli, which is a bit childish. Throwing away food without telling her is disrespectful and wasteful. On the other hand, the author could be trying to find a middle ground, maybe by finding meals that both can agree on, but she's already making an effort by avoiding foods that upset her stomach. \n\nIs she at fault? She's not forcing him to eat anything; she's making meals he'll eat. The issue is more about him not respecting her efforts and being wasteful. The author's position is understandable. Relationships require compromise, but the husband isn't contributing fairly here. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The husband's actions are more at fault for the conflict. She's trying to balance her health goals without forcing him to eat what he dislikes, while he's not respecting her and wasting food.\n"
