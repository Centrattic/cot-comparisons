My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The main points are that the author wants to eat healthier, with more vegetables, while her husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. He's been dismissive, making faces at broccoli and throwing away uneaten food. The author is tired of making meals she doesn't want to eat just because he doesn't like them, and she's trying to stay healthy. She also mentions that he wants to lose weight but isn't making an effort to eat healthier himself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband isn't open to trying healthier options and even wastes food when he doesn't like it. The author is making an effort to get healthier but is being forced to cook meals she's not comfortable eating. It seems like the husband isn't contributing equally to their shared goal of weight loss. The fact that he throws away food he doesn't finish is wasteful and shows a lack of consideration for the author's efforts.\n\nThe author's main argument is about personal boundaries and health goals. She's not the one being inconsiderate here; she's trying to maintain her health while dealing with a partner who isn't cooperative. The husband's behavior, like making faces and wasting food, indicates he's not trying to meet her halfway. The author shouldn't have to compromise her health goals to accommodate his preferences, especially when he's not making an effort to adjust his diet.\n\nI think the key points here are mutual respect and shared responsibility. The author is within her rights to prioritize her health and refuse to cook meals that she's uncomfortable with. The husband's resistance and wastefulness are the bigger issues here. So, she's not in the wrong for wanting to set boundaries and take care of her health.\n"
