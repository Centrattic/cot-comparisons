My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The situation is that the husband prefers heavy meals like burgers, steak, and fried foods, while the author wants to eat healthier and vegetarian dishes. The husband even accused her of making broccoli to watch him suffer and throws away food he doesn't like without telling her. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to maintain her health and prefers not to prepare two different meals every day, which can be time-consuming and maybe inconvenient. On the other hand, the husband seems to have strong dislikes for certain foods, which could affect his well-being if he's only eating what the author makes. But he also wastes food by throwing it away without communication. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and compromise in a relationship. The author has communicated her desire to eat healthier and mentioned making meals that include things like broccoli, which he doesn't like. The husband's response of making \"disgusting faces\" and wasting food could indicate a lack of consideration for her efforts. However, the author is making food he likes to avoid waste, but now he's eating pasta twice a week, which upsets her stomach. So there's a bit of a cycle here.\n\nIs it fair for the author to not cook separate meals? Many people in relationships have differing dietary needs or preferences. It's common for one person to prepare meals that accommodate both, but sometimes it's not feasible. The author isn't forcing him to eat her meals; she's trying to find a middle ground. The husband's behavior of discarding food without discussing it is inconsiderate, and that might be where the problem lies. \n\nThe author's goal is to eat healthier, which is a personal choice. If the husband is choosing to eat what's available, even if it's not ideal for him, that's his decision. But he's not making an effort to choose lighter options when asked. The issue is more about the husband not respecting the author's efforts and wasting food rather than the author being in the wrong for not cooking separately. So the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
