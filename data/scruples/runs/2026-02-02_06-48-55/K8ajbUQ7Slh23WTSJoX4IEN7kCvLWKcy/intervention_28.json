My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband because of dietary differences.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, and doesn't want to make two meals every day. The husband prefers heavy, unhealthy meals and has been wasteful, throwing away food she made. She's adjusting her cooking to avoid waste, but it's making her eat things she doesn't like, like pasta which upsets her stomach. The husband also wants to lose weight but isn't making changes.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate if her actions are justified. \n\nCooking is a shared responsibility in many relationships. The husband's behavior of throwing away food is clearly problematic and wasteful. The author is trying to find a middle ground by making meals he'll eat, even if it's not healthy for her. However, she's compromising her own health goals to avoid waste. \n\nThe question is whether she's wrong for not making separate meals. Since the husband is not contributing to meal planning or showing willingness to adapt, the author's desire to avoid waste and stick to her health goals seems reasonable. The husband's refusal to try new foods and his wastefulness might shift the blame more onto him. \n\nThe author isn't forcing him to eat something; she's adjusting her cooking based on his preferences, but it's leading to her eating poorly. It's a tough spot, but she's trying to balance both their needs. The husband's lack of effort to improve his diet or communicate better could make the author right in not accommodating his preferences at her own expense. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
