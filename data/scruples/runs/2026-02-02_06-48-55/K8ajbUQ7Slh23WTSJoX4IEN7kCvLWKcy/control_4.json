My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband because of dietary preferences. The husband likes heavy, unhealthy foods, and she wants to eat healthier. He's being uncooperative, even wasting food when she makes something he doesn't like.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a valid personal goal. Making separate meals every day sounds exhausting. It's reasonable to want to avoid that, especially if one person's preferences are leading to waste. The husband's behavior\u2014making faces, not trying new foods, wasting food\u2014is problematic. He's not open to change and is contributing to the problem by not eating what's prepared. \n\nThe key points are: the author isn't the one causing the waste; the husband is. She's making an effort to accommodate his preferences but he's not reciprocating. She's also trying to avoid making meals that make her sick. The husband's accusation that she's making broccoli to watch him suffer is pretty childish and unhelpful. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's not unreasonable for her to want to not cook two different meals. The issue here is the husband's resistance to trying healthier options and his wastefulness. The author is trying to maintain her health goals without forcing him to eat something he dislikes, which is a reasonable stance. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong). The husband's behavior is the main problem here. She's making a good-faith effort to balance both their needs, but he's not cooperating and causing food waste. It's his actions that are leading to the conflict, not hers.\n"
