My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author wants to eat healthier and likes vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. He even made a comment about her making broccoli to make him suffer. She doesn't want to make two meals every day and wants to have vegetarian dishes sometimes. She's tried to get him to choose lighter options, but he doesn't know what to pick. Also, he throws away food he doesn't like without telling her, which she found out by visiting his work. Now she's making food he'll eat even if she doesn't like it, but some of it upsets her stomach.\n\nThe question is whether she's wrong for not wanting to make separate meals. Let's break it down. \n\nCooking is often a shared responsibility, but if one person has different dietary needs, it can be a point of contention. The husband's behavior is problematic\u2014he's not trying to adapt, he's making snide comments, and he's wasting food. The author is trying to eat healthier and avoid foods that make her sick. She's also considering the waste issue, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe husband's refusal to try new foods or consider lighter meals adds to the problem. Wasting food is a red flag here. If he's throwing away what she makes, that's disrespectful and wasteful. The author is trying to balance both their needs but is struggling because he's not cooperating. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't wrong for not wanting to cook two separate meals. It's reasonable to expect mutual compromise. If the husband is unwilling to adapt or communicate, the responsibility isn't solely on her. She's also trying to maintain her health, which is a personal goal. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong. The husband's behavior is contributing significantly to the problem. She's making reasonable efforts to accommodate him without sacrificing her own health and values. The answer should be B (No).\n"
