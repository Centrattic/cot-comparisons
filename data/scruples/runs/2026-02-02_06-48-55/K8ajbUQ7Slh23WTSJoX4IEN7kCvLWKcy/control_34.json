My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about cooking meals for her husband versus her own health goals. She wants to eat healthier, but her husband prefers heavy meals and doesn't want to eat what she makes. He even throws away food he doesn't like, which she found out about at work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to take care of her health, which is a valid personal goal. Making separate meals every day might be a lot of work, and she wants to have vegetarian options that she likes. The husband, on the other hand, has his own food preferences and doesn't want to adapt. He even made a comment about her making broccoli to watch him suffer, which sounds dismissive and maybe a bit childish. Also, he's wasting food by throwing it away if he doesn't like it, which is wasteful and disrespectful to the effort put into cooking.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and compromise. The author isn't wrong for wanting to eat healthier. However, she might be in the wrong if she's not trying to find a middle ground. For example, maybe she could cook meals that both of them can enjoy or agree on some days where they each have separate dishes. But the husband's behavior\u2014disrespecting her food and wasting it\u2014is definitely problematic. He's not making an effort to accommodate her preferences or even discuss solutions, which contributes to the problem.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to make compromises. The author is trying to communicate her needs, but the husband isn't responding constructively. Since the husband isn't willing to adjust his habits and is causing waste, the blame isn't entirely on the author. She's justified in not wanting to cook meals that she can't eat or that make her sick. So the answer would be that she's not in the wrong.\n"
