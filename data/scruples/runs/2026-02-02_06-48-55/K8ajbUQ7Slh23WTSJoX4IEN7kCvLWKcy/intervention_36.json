My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The situation is that she wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, while her husband prefers heavy meals. He's not adventurous with food and even makes faces when he eats broccoli. The author doesn't want to make two meals daily and wants to have vegetarian dishes sometimes. She's tried suggesting lighter options, but he doesn't know what to pick. Also, he throws away uneaten food at work without telling her. Now she's making meals he'll eat, even if she doesn't like them, to avoid waste. She feels like she's the asshole for making food he doesn't want and having it wasted. Her husband also wants to lose weight but isn't making the effort.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants my opinion. Let's consider both sides. \n\nFirst, the author's perspective: She's trying to eat healthier, which is her right. Cooking two separate meals every day would be time-consuming and impractical. She's making an effort to avoid waste by making meals she doesn't like, but she's not happy about it. The husband's behavior of throwing away food is wasteful and disrespectful, and she's trying to accommodate him by making what he wants, even if it's not ideal for her.\n\nThe husband's perspective: He wants to eat his preferred foods, which are unhealthy. However, he's not trying to adapt or find middle ground. He's resistant to trying new things and ends up wasting food, which is inconsiderate. His refusal to compromise might be contributing to the problem.\n\nNow, considering fairness in relationships. Both partners should work together to find solutions. The husband isn't making an effort to eat healthier or try new foods, which is his responsibility if he wants to lose weight. The author is within her rights to prioritize her health and not want to cook separate meals. The husband's actions of wasting food are inconsiderate, which adds to the author's frustration. \n\nAlso, the author is making an effort to avoid waste by adjusting her meals, but that's not sustainable if she's not happy. The core issue is the husband's lack of willingness to adapt, not the author's refusal to cook two meals. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The husband's inconsiderate behavior and lack of effort to find a solution are the main issues. The author's stance is reasonable.\n"
