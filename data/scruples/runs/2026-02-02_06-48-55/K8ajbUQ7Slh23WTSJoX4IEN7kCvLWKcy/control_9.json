My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The main issue is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. The wife wants to eat healthier, likes vegetables, and her husband prefers heavy meals. He's been dismissive, even making fun of her cooking broccoli. She doesn't want to make two meals each day and is tired of her food being wasted when he throws it away. She's now making meals he likes, even if it's not good for her. Her husband also wants to lose weight but isn't making an effort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The wife has a valid reason for wanting to eat healthier and lose weight. Making separate meals every day can be time-consuming and frustrating. The husband's behavior, like making faces at broccoli and wasting food, shows a lack of consideration. He's not trying to accommodate her preferences, even though he's also on a weight loss journey. \n\nThe wife's actions of making food he likes, even if it's not good for her, might seem like a compromise, but it's not sustainable for her health goals. The husband's refusal to try lighter meals and his wastefulness are problematic. He's not respecting her efforts to eat healthier, which can lead to resentment.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some accountability. The husband isn't supporting her goals, and the wife might be compromising too much. However, the question is whether the wife is in the wrong. Since she's the one setting boundaries to protect her health and reduce waste, she's not in the wrong. The husband's behavior is more at fault here. The wife is justified in wanting to avoid cooking separate meals and is trying to find a solution that works for both of them. The answer should be B (No), she's not in the wrong.\n"
