My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about meal preparation and differing dietary preferences between the author and her husband. \n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier and loves vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meals like burgers, steak, potatoes, etc. He gets annoyed with the broccoli, making a joke about her wanting to watch him suffer. She doesn't want to cook separate meals every day and wants to have vegetarian dishes sometimes. She's tried suggesting lighter options, but he doesn't know or doesn't like them, and he ends up throwing away the food she makes without telling her. Now she's making meals he'll eat, even though they don't suit her, to prevent waste. She's feeling like she's being the asshole because she's avoiding making him food he likes (like pasta) that upsets her stomach but he likes. The husband also wants to lose weight but doesn't want to exercise or eat healthier.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author is trying to eat healthier, her husband has different tastes and wastes food she makes, leading her to cook what he wants. She's conflicted because she's avoiding making dishes he likes that she can't eat, and they both want to lose weight but aren't aligning efforts. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom what I read, the husband is not being considerate. He wastes food she prepares, which is disrespectful. The author is trying to manage their meals to avoid waste and accommodate his preferences while also trying to eat healthier. However, she's compromising her own health goals by eating food that upsets her stomach. \n\nThe husband's behavior is problematic because throwing away food without communication leads to waste and shows a lack of consideration. The author is trying to find a balance, but it's clear that the husband isn't contributing to the solution. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her health and avoiding waste. She's trying to adjust, but the main issue is the husband's lack of effort and respect. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
