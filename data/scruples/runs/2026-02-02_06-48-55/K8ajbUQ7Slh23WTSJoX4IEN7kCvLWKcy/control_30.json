My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. She wants to eat healthier, he likes heavy meals. He makes faces at her food, doesn't try new things, and even throws away leftovers without telling her. The husband wants to lose weight but doesn't want to eat healthier or exercise.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author is trying to eat better, which is a legitimate health goal. Making separate meals can be a lot of work, especially if the husband isn't cooperative. He's not only not trying new foods but also wasting the food she makes, which adds to the problem. She's adjusting her cooking to his preferences, but that's making her unhappy because she has to eat food she doesn't like or that upsets her stomach.\n\nThe husband's behavior seems dismissive and disrespectful. Making faces at her food and wasting it without communication is not good. The author is trying to find a balance, but her needs are being overlooked. The fact that he's not making an effort to eat healthier despite wanting to lose weight might show a lack of commitment. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong. She has a right to her health goals and shouldn't have to compromise to the point of her own discomfort. The husband's actions contribute to the problem. The key points here are communication breakdown, respect for each other's dietary needs, and the husband's unwillingness to adapt. The author is justified in not wanting to cook separate meals if it causes her stress and if he's not respecting her efforts. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
