My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to make separate meals for her husband. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier and loves vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meals like burgers, steak, etc. He even accused her of making broccoli to make him suffer. That's pretty harsh. She doesn't want to cook two different meals every day and wants to have vegetarian dishes sometimes. \n\nShe's tried suggesting lighter meals, but he doesn't know. Also, he throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it, which she found out by visiting his work. Now she's making things he'll eat even if she doesn't like them to avoid waste. But pasta upsets her stomach and they had it twice this week. She feels like she's the asshole for making food he doesn't want and for it getting wasted. She also mentions he wants to lose weight but doesn't take action like going to the gym or eating better.\n\nSo, the main issues here are about differing dietary needs and preferences, effort in meal planning, and the husband's behavior of discarding food without communication. \n\nIn relationships, compromises are usually expected, but there's a balance. Cooking is often a shared responsibility. The author is feeling overwhelmed by having to cater to his preferences while also trying to meet her health goals. The husband's actions\u2014throwing away food\u2014seems disrespectful and wasteful. \n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable in wanting to have meals that suit her preferences. It's fair for both partners to contribute to meal planning. The husband's lack of effort to try new foods or communicate better is part of the problem. The waste is also on him, not her. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
