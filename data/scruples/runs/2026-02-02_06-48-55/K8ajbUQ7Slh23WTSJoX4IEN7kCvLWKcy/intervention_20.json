My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this AITA question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier and enjoys vegetables. Her husband, on the other hand, prefers heavier, less healthy meals like burgers, steak, and fried chicken. There's some tension here because she doesn't want to make two separate meals every day. The husband has made a comment implying that she's making broccoli to watch him suffer, and he throws away food he doesn't like at work without telling her. She's now making food he likes, even if it upsets her stomach, to avoid waste.\n\nThe author feels like she's the asshole because she's making food he doesn't want and then it's wasted. She's trying to get healthier and lose weight, while her husband also wants to lose weight but isn't taking it seriously.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if she's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. From her perspective, she's trying to follow her dietary preferences and avoid waste. She's making an effort to accommodate his preferences, even if it's not ideal for her. On the other hand, his behavior of throwing away food without communication is problematic and disrespectful. However, she's not completely without fault. If he's not willing to try new foods or compromise, maybe she should have a clearer conversation about expectations. But is she the one in the wrong here?\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. She's trying her best given his lack of flexibility, and he's not contributing to the solution. She's making sacrifices (eating food that upsets her stomach) to avoid waste. Her husband's actions of throwing away food without telling her are disrespectful and wasteful. She's trying to balance her health goals with his preferences, but he's not cooperating. \n\nIn many relationships, it's common to make some compromises. However, if only one person is making the effort, it can lead to resentment. The husband's behavior is definitely part of the problem here. The author isn't the one who's being unreasonable in her own health goals. She's trying to avoid waste, which is a valid concern. The husband's lack of effort to try healthier options or communicate better is a bigger issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's making reasonable efforts under a difficult situation. The husband's behavior is contributing more to the problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
