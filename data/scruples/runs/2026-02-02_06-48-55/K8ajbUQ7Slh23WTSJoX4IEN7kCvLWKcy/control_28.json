My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about making separate meals for the husband. The author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, but the husband prefers heavy meals like burgers and fried chicken. The husband even accuses her of making broccoli to watch him suffer. She doesn't want to make two meals every day. She tried suggesting lighter meals, but he doesn't go for it. He also throws away food he doesn't like without telling her. Now she's making meals he'll eat, even if she doesn't like them, to prevent waste. She's worried she's the asshole.\n\nSo, the main points are: shared cooking responsibilities, differing dietary preferences, food waste, and communication issues. The user is asking if she's in the wrong. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, is it fair for her not to make separate meals? If they're sharing meals, it's reasonable to expect some compromise. But if he's being resistant and causing waste, that's a problem. She's making food he doesn't like, then he's throwing it away. That's not good for either of them. She's adjusting to his preferences to avoid waste, but that might not be fair to her either. She wants to eat healthier, which is a valid goal. \n\nHe's not trying to adapt, which could be part of the issue. He wants to lose weight but isn't eating healthier. The communication seems lacking. She asked him to pick lighter options, but he doesn't know. Maybe they need to talk more about their needs. Also, throwing food away without telling her is disrespectful and causes waste. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. She's not forcing him to eat broccoli; he's making that a big deal. She's trying to find a middle ground but is struggling. The husband's behavior (mocking, wasting food) is probably the bigger issue here. She's not the asshole for not wanting to cook separate meals every day. It's a shared responsibility, and he's not contributing to the solution. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong). She's trying her best given his uncooperative behavior. He's the one causing waste and being inflexible. She's adjusting to his preferences to avoid conflict and waste, but that doesn't make her at fault. The problem lies more with his actions and lack of communication.\n"
