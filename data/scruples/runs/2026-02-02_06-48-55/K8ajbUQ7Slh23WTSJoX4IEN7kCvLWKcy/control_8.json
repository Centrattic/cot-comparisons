My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. \n\nFirst, the husband's eating habits are quite different from hers. She wants to eat healthier, with more vegetables, while he prefers heavy, starchy, and fried foods. He even made a sarcastic comment about her making broccoli to watch him suffer. That's pretty negative.\n\nShe mentions she doesn't want to make two meals every day. That's a common issue in relationships where partners have different dietary needs. She's tried to get him to choose lighter meals, but he doesn't know what to pick. Also, he throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it, which she found out by visiting his work. That's a big problem because it's wasteful and disrespectful.\n\nNow, she's compromising by making food he likes, even if she can't eat it (like pasta that upsets her stomach). She feels like she's the asshole because the meals are wasted, but she's trying to get healthy. The husband wants to lose weight too, but only if he doesn't have to exercise or eat healthier. That's contradictory.\n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, she's trying to balance her health goals with his preferences. He's contributing to the problem by being wasteful and not open to trying new foods. She's not the one in the wrong here. The husband's behavior (disrespectful comments, throwing food away) is more problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
