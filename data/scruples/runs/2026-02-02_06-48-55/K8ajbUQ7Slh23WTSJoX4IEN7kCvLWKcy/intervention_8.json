My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband because of differing dietary preferences.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, and is trying to lose weight. Her husband prefers heavy, less healthy foods. There's an issue where he throws food away if he doesn't like it, which the author finds wasteful and frustrating. She's making meals he'll eat, even if she doesn't like them, to avoid waste. He also accused her of making broccoli to watch him suffer, which adds some tension.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to consider the dynamics. Cooking is a shared responsibility in many relationships, but it's not always equal. The author is compromising by making meals he likes, but he's not reciprocating. He's not trying new foods or making lighter choices, and he's wasting food. That seems unfair. The author's health goals are valid, and not wanting to cook separate meals is reasonable, especially if it's a shared kitchen.\n\nThe husband's behavior of wasting food is problematic. The author is trying to accommodate his preferences, but he's not making an effort. It's a two-way street. If he's not willing to compromise or try healthier options, the author has the right to prioritize her own needs. The fact that he's not supporting her health goals either by joining in or respecting her wishes adds to the problem.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to balance their needs, and the husband's lack of cooperation is the main issue. The key points are the husband's refusal to try lighter meals, wasting food, and not supporting her goals. The author is justified in not wanting to cook separate meals, especially when he's not making an effort to meet her halfway.\n"
