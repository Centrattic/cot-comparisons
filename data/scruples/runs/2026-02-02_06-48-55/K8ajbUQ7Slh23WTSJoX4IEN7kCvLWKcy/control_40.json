My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about making separate meals for a husband. The author wants to eat healthier, with more vegetables, while the husband prefers heavy, less healthy foods. They don't want to make two meals every day, but the husband throws away food he doesn't like, leading to waste. The author feels they're being the asshole for making food he doesn't want and for the waste.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is a personal goal. They mention that the husband's food preferences are different, and they don't want to cook two meals each day. The husband's behavior of throwing away food without telling them is problematic because it leads to waste. The author is adjusting their cooking to accommodate the husband's preferences to avoid waste, even if it's not ideal for them. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's refusal to try new foods or lighter meals might be an issue. The author has asked him to consider lighter options, but he doesn't know what to choose. The husband's reaction to broccoli suggests he's resistant to trying healthier foods, which the author might find frustrating. \n\nThe key points here are shared responsibility in a household, communication, and compromise. The author is making an effort to cook meals that the husband will eat, which is reasonable. The husband's habit of throwing away food is wasteful and disrespectful. The author isn't being unreasonable by not wanting to cook two meals all the time. They are making an effort to find a middle ground. \n\nThe husband's behavior should be addressed first. The author isn't the one causing the waste; the husband is. So the author isn't in the wrong for trying to avoid making food that gets thrown away. They are trying to eat healthier, which is their right. The husband needs to be more open to trying new foods and communicate better. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The situation points more to the husband's behavior being the issue rather than the author's.\n"
