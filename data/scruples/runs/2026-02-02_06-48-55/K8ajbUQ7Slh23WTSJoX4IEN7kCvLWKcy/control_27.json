My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. \n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier and loves vegetables, but her husband prefers heavy meals. He even accused her of making broccoli to make him suffer, which seems like a childish reaction. She's trying to eat better and lose weight, which is a personal goal, and she doesn't want to compromise her health by eating what he likes.\n\nThe husband throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it, which is wasteful and disrespectful. The author is making meals he'll eat, even if they're not good for her, which is causing her to avoid her own dietary needs. She's frustrated because she's trying to do the right thing but ends up not getting to eat healthy food because of his behavior.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and compromise. The husband isn't being considerate of her health goals, and his actions (throwing away food) are problematic. The author is trying to balance both their needs, but the husband isn't doing his part. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both parties to make adjustments. If the husband isn't willing to try healthier options or even attempt to eat what she makes, the author isn't at fault for prioritizing her health. The husband's behavior contributes to the issue, so the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
