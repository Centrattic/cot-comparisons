My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals. They want to eat healthier, but their husband prefers heavy, less healthy food. The husband even accuses them of making broccoli to make him suffer. He throws away food if he doesn't like it. The author is making meals he'll eat, even if they don't agree with them, to avoid waste.\n\nHmm. So the main issue is whether the author is wrong for not cooking two different meals. On one hand, it's reasonable for someone to want to eat healthily and not have to prepare separate meals every day. Cooking two meals can be a lot of work. The husband's behavior is problematic too\u2014making faces, throwing food away without telling her. That's disrespectful and wasteful.\n\nBut the author is adjusting their cooking to avoid waste and accommodate the husband's preferences, even if it's not ideal for them. They're not forcing him to eat what they make, but he ends up wasting it. So maybe it's a mutual issue. The husband isn't trying to adapt either, just expects her to make what he likes. The author's stance seems reasonable. They're not in the wrong for wanting to eat what they prefer and not overextending themselves with two meals. The husband's actions are more to blame here. So the answer is B.\n"
