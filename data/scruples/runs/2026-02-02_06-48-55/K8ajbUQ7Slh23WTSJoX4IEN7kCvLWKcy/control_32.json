My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for her husband. So the main issue here is about meal preferences and the effort each person is putting into their shared meals.\n\nThe author wants to eat healthier, loves vegetables, and finds her husband's preferences heavy. She mentions he doesn't like vegetables, makes faces, and throws away food he doesn't like. She's trying to avoid making two meals every day and wants to have vegetarian options. She's also concerned about food waste and her own health goals.\n\nNow, considering the details, the husband isn't open to trying new foods. He's resistant to lighter meals and ends up wasting food he doesn't like. The author is trying to balance her health goals with his preferences, but it's causing conflict. She's making meals he can eat, even if they're not her preference, but that's leading to her eating things that upset her stomach, like pasta. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual effort and respect. The husband isn't making an effort to adapt his diet, which leads to wasted food and the author having to compromise her health. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals if it's causing her distress and she's trying to meet her health goals. The husband's behavior (wasting food, not trying new things) seems to be the root of the problem here.\n\nSo, the answer should be B, meaning the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility isn't solely on her to accommodate his preferences when he's not reciprocating the effort. They both need to find a middle ground, maybe by the husband trying to eat healthier or they agree on separate meals if necessary. The author's stance is reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
