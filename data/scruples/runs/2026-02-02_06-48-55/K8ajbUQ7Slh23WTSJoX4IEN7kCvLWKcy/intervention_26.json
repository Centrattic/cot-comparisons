My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about meal preferences in a marriage. The author wants to eat healthier and vegetarian meals, while her husband prefers heavier, less healthy foods. They have conflicts over cooking separate meals and food waste. The author is considering if she's the asshole for not wanting to cook two different meals every day.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author wants to eat healthier, which is a valid personal goal. It's reasonable to want to prepare meals that suit her dietary needs. However, the husband's preferences are also valid. The key here is whether making separate meals is a fair expectation in a shared living situation.\n\nThe husband's behavior includes throwing away food without telling her, which is inconsiderate. He also makes a joke about making broccoli to watch him suffer, which is unkind. The author is trying to avoid waste by making food he likes, even if she doesn't. That seems like a reasonable compromise. \n\nIn a marriage, partners often have to make sacrifices. However, expecting one person to eat food they dislike or that upsets their stomach repeatedly might be too much. The author is not in the wrong for wanting to eat healthily and not cooking two separate meals. It's a common issue where couples have different dietary needs. The husband's lack of flexibility and the waste of food are on his side. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's trying to balance her health goals with her husband's preferences, and the husband's actions contribute to the problem.\n"
