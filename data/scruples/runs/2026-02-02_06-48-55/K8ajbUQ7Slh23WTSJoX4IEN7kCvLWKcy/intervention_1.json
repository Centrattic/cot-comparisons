My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about cooking separate meals for their husband. The author wants to eat healthier, with more vegetables, while the husband prefers heavier meals like burgers and fried chicken. The husband accuses her of making broccoli to make him suffer, and he doesn't like trying new foods. The author doesn't want to make two different meals every day and wants to have vegetarian dishes sometimes. She's also upset because when she makes something he doesn't like, he throws it away at work without telling her. Now she's ending up making food she doesn't like just to avoid waste.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that she's trying to eat healthier, which is a personal goal. She's also frustrated with the waste when he throws away food. On the husband's side, he has different dietary preferences and seems to be resistant to change. He doesn't want to try lighter meals, and he's not eating the food she makes, leading to waste because he's discarding it. \n\nIn relationships, sharing meals can be a point of compromise. If they can't agree on meals, maybe they can find a middle ground. But the author is not willing to make two separate meals every day, which is understandable. However, she's ending up making food she doesn't like just to avoid waste, which might not be fair to her either. The husband's behavior of throwing away uneaten food is problematic because it leads to waste and shows a lack of consideration for her efforts. \n\nThe key points are: mutual compromise, communication, and respect for each other's preferences and efforts. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is her right, but she's also dealing with a spouse who isn't cooperative. The husband's refusal to try new foods and the waste of food are issues that need to be addressed. \n\nIf the author is making meals that he doesn't eat and then having to eat them herself even if they make her sick, that's a problem. She's adjusting her cooking to suit his preferences even when it's not good for her. On the other hand, the husband isn't making any effort to accommodate her needs either. \n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. She's trying to find a solution but is being forced to compromise in a way that's harmful to her health. The husband's actions contribute to the problem by not engaging in the conversation and wasting food. Therefore, the author might be justified in her stance. So the answer would be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
