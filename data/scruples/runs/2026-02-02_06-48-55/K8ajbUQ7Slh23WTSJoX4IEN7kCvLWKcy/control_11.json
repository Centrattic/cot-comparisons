My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about cooking preferences between a couple. The author wants to eat healthier, with more vegetables, but the husband prefers heavier meals like burgers and fried food. The husband has made comments about the author making broccoli to watch him suffer, and he throws away food he doesn't like at work. The author feels they're the asshole for making food that gets wasted, and they don't want to cook separate meals every day. They also mention that the husband wants to lose weight but doesn't take steps like going to the gym or eating better.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about shared responsibilities in a relationship, communication, and mutual respect. The author is trying to maintain their health goals, which is reasonable. The husband's behavior of not trying new foods, making negative comments, and wasting food without communication could be problematic. The author is trying to avoid waste by making food the husband likes, even if it's not healthy for them. \n\nIs it reasonable for the author to not want to cook two separate meals every day? In many households, couples adjust meals to accommodate each other's preferences. However, if one person is consistently making sacrifices without the other's cooperation, that could be an issue. The husband's refusal to try healthier options and his wastefulness might be contributing to the problem. The author is trying to find a middle ground but is facing resistance from the husband's side.\n\nAlso, the husband's comment about the broccoli suggests a lack of appreciation for the author's efforts. Throwing food away without communication adds to the frustration. The author's desire to eat healthier is valid, and they're not forcing the husband to eat anything. The issue seems to stem from the husband's unwillingness to adapt and the resulting waste of food and resources. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties could have more communication. The author has tried to discuss lighter meal options, but the husband isn't responsive. The husband's actions (wasting food) are disrespectful and impractical. The author is not in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals all the time when the husband doesn't reciprocate or show appreciation. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong. The husband's behavior is more problematic here. The answer should be B.\n"
