My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about cooking meals. The author doesn't want to make separate meals for her husband because he eats heavy, unhealthy food, and she wants to eat healthier. The husband throws away food she makes if he doesn't like it, which makes her feel like she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband's behavior of throwing away food without telling her is definitely problematic. That's wasteful and disrespectful. The author is trying to eat healthier and avoid making food she doesn't want to eat. She's also concerned about food waste. She's asked him to try lighter meals, but he's not cooperative.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's refusal to adapt and his wastefulness. The author is trying to balance her own health goals with his preferences, but he's not making an effort. If she's making food he doesn't like, but he's not communicating that, maybe there's a breakdown in communication. However, the fact that he's throwing away food without consulting her adds to her being in the right because she's trying to avoid waste.\n\nAlso, she's making things he likes even if she doesn't like them, which could be a compromise, but he's not reciprocating. The husband's lack of willingness to try new foods or healthier options is on him. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to cook two meals every day. It's reasonable to expect some mutual effort in meal planning.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The husband's actions are contributing to the problem, and the author is trying to find a solution that works for her health while minimizing waste. The main issue lies with the husband's behavior, not the author's.\n"
