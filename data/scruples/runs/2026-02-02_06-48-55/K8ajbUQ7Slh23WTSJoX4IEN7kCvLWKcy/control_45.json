My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to cook separate meals for their husband. The main points are about differing dietary preferences and the husband's reaction to certain foods.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier, focusing on vegetables, while the husband prefers heavy, less healthy meals. The husband's behavior includes making faces at broccoli and throwing away food he doesn't like without a word. The author is frustrated by the waste and the effort of making two meals daily.\n\nThe key issues here are mutual respect and compromise. The author has tried to communicate their preferences and the husband's response is problematic. The husband is not only resistant to trying new foods but also wasteful, which adds to the author's stress. The author's priority is their health goals, which are valid. \n\nThe husband's actions\u2014dismissive behavior, not eating what's prepared, and wasting food\u2014show a lack of consideration. The author is trying to find a middle ground but feels like they're the bad guy. Since the husband isn't making an effort to adapt, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own needs and health. So the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
