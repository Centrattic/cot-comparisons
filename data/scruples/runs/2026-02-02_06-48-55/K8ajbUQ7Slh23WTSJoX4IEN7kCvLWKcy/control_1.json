My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about cooking separate meals. The author wants to eat healthier, but her husband prefers heavy meals. He even accused her of making broccoli to watch him suffer. He doesn't try new foods and throws away leftovers if he doesn't like them.\n\nSo, the author is frustrated because she doesn't want to make two meals every day. She's been making what he likes, but sometimes she can't eat what she makes, which upsets her stomach. She feels like she's the asshole for making food he doesn't want and then having it wasted. Her husband isn't trying to eat healthier even though he also wants to lose weight. \n\nHmm. The key points here are about shared responsibilities in a relationship. Both partners need to compromise. If the husband isn't open to trying healthier options and is wasteful with food, that's on him. The author is trying to take care of her health, which is reasonable. Making two meals every day sounds exhausting, and it's not fair for her to bear that burden alone. Also, the husband throwing food away is irresponsible. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for wanting to eat the way she needs to. It's a common issue in relationships where dietary needs differ. The husband's behavior\u2014being uncooperative, wasteful, and not trying new foods\u2014contributes to the problem. The author's main issue is the lack of compromise. So, she's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
