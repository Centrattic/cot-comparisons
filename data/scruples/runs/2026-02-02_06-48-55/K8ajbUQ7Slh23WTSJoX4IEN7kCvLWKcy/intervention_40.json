My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The author is asking if they're the asshole for not wanting to cook separate meals. They want to eat healthier and love vegetables, but their husband prefers heavy, greasy foods. He's even made a comment about making broccoli to watch him suffer. The husband doesn't try new foods and throws away leftovers if he doesn't like them. The author ends up making meals he'll eat, even if they make her sick, to avoid waste.\n\nFirst, the author's main issue is that they don't want to cook two different meals daily. They want to eat healthier, which is a personal choice. The husband's behavior, like making faces at broccoli and wasting food, seems problematic. The author is adjusting their cooking to his preferences, even when it's not good for them. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, it's a shared household, so compromise is expected. But the husband's actions\u2014like throwing away food without communication\u2014are inconsiderate. The author is trying to eat better, which is a valid goal. However, not cooking separate meals isn't inherently wrong. The husband's lack of flexibility and respect for the author's efforts might be the bigger issue. \n\nThe author might be in the right because they're trying to meet their health goals without forcing the husband to eat what they want. The husband's behavior (wasting food, being uncooperative) could be the real problem here. So, the answer is B.\n"
