My husband, however, loves heavy meals. Burgers, steak, potatoes, fried chicken, fast food, etc.  He once accused me of making broccoli just because I like to watch him suffer (he makes disgusting faces when he eats broccoli)  He eats like a 5 year old and isnt really adventurous in trying new foods.\n\n\nI dont want to make two different meals every day, and every once in a while I'd like to just have a vegetarian dish, maybe a meal that doesnt include a starchy vegetable.\n\n\nIve ask him about him picking some lighter meal options but he never knows.  And if I make something he doesnt care for he will throw it away at work without telling me. (Found this out by visiting work and seeing the food he sent to work with sitting on top of the trash)\n\n\nSince then I'm mostly making things he will eat, and things I dont eant to, or make me sick to eat, so he doesnt waste food. (He loves pasta but it upsets my stomach, but we've had that twice this week.)\n\n\nI feel like I'm being the asshole for 1) making food he doesnt want and 2) having that food wasted.  I just want to get healthy and lose some weight, eat better.  (He also wants to lose weight but as long as he doesnt have to go to the gym, or eat healthier I guess lol)\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about meal preferences and cooking habits.\n\nFirst, the author wants to eat healthier, with more vegetables and lighter meals. The husband prefers heavy, starchy foods and doesn't like trying new things. The husband even accuses her of making broccoli to make him suffer, which is clearly not a healthy dynamic. Also, he throws away food she makes that he doesn't like without telling her, leading to waste. The author is making meals he'll eat, even if she doesn't like them, to avoid waste. She feels like she's the asshole for not making separate meals and for the food being wasted.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess that. Let's break it down. Cooking is a shared responsibility in many relationships, but it's not always equal. The husband's behavior\u2014throwing away food without communication\u2014is problematic. The author is trying to eat healthier, which is personal and health-related, and the husband's refusal to try new things or even acknowledge the waste is a red flag. \n\nThe key points here are the husband's lack of effort in trying lighter meals, his accusation about the broccoli, and his wastefulness. The author is making compromises by preparing meals he likes even when she doesn't, which shows she's trying. The husband isn't contributing to the solution. In a balanced relationship, both partners should make some effort. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to cook two separate meals every day, especially since the husband isn't willing to adjust his preferences or communicate better. The waste is on the husband's side because he's not respecting her efforts and is being careless with food. \n\nSo, the author isn't the asshole here. The husband's behavior is more in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
