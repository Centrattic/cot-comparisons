For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for lying to their boyfriend about his ex cheating. They wanted him to move on, so they told him they saw the ex with other guys at a party, even though they didn't actually see it. Now they're feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, the act of lying is definitely a red flag. Honesty is a cornerstone of trust in relationships. Even if the intention was good\u2014to help him move on\u2014the lie was about a serious matter: infidelity. That's a big deal. The author might have thought it would make things easier, but lying can have long-term consequences. \n\nAlso, the author didn't just lie once; they had to keep up the lie. That means they had to maintain a story that could be exposed as false if more evidence came to light. If the ex wasn't actually cheating, then the author's lie is causing the boyfriend to have a false narrative about the breakup. That could affect how he views their past relationship and possibly his trust in his own judgment. \n\nAnother angle is the manipulation involved. The author manipulated the situation to make their boyfriend feel better, but at what cost? They were motivated by their own desire to help him move on, but maybe they should have encouraged him to process his feelings rather than fabricating a reason. \n\nHowever, the context is a college relationship where emotions are high. The author had a crush for a long time and finally got the relationship. They might have felt desperate to make it work. But that doesn't excuse the lie. Intentional deceit for personal reasons, even if well-meaning, is still harmful. \n\nSo, putting it all together: lying about someone cheating is a serious issue. Even if it was to help him move on, the lie is morally wrong. The author is in the wrong because they intentionally misled their partner about a significant event, which could damage trust and their relationship in the long run.\n"
