For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for lying to their boyfriend about his ex cheating, which made him move on faster. So the main question is whether the lie was justified or not.\n\nFirst, the author started dating her boyfriend after he broke up with his ex. He was still upset and questioning the breakup. She had a crush on him for a while but couldn't act on it because he was with someone else. Now, when they started dating, he asked if she saw his ex at a party where cheating rumors were. She lied and said she saw the ex with other guys, which made him feel better and move on. She's now conflicted because keeping the lie might have helped him, but it's wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the lie was meant to help the boyfriend feel better, but it's a lie. The author claims there's no benefit in telling the truth now, but the boyfriend is happier. However, lying to someone, even with good intentions, might have consequences. The boyfriend might find out later, which could damage trust. Even if the intention was good, lying is generally considered wrong, especially in a relationship where honesty is crucial. \n\nThe author might have thought she was helping, but manipulating the truth, even to help, is still manipulation. The boyfriend has the right to know the truth about his ex's actions. If the author didn't see anything, then her lie is a fabrication. Even if the ex did do something, the author shouldn't be the one to spread that without evidence. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation was her own desire to see the boyfriend move on, which might not be a valid reason to lie. The boyfriend's happiness shouldn't come at the cost of deceit. So, even if the outcome seems positive, the means were unethical. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because lying, regardless of the intention, is a betrayal of trust. The answer should be A.\n"
