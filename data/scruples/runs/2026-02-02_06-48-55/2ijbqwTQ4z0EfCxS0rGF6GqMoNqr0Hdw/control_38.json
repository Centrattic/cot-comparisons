For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author started dating her boyfriend after he broke up with his ex. His ex cheated, according to rumors at a party. The author was at the party but didn't see the ex with anyone. However, when the boyfriend asked, she lied and said she saw the ex with other guys, which made him move on faster. Now she's conflicted because he's happy, and she's keeping up the lie.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author intentionally lied, which might have caused the boyfriend to accept the breakup more easily. The boyfriend didn't dump the ex, she did, and the author's lie contributed to his closure. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nEthically, lying is usually considered wrong because it breaches trust. Even if the intention was to help him move on, the lie could have consequences. Maybe if the ex actually didn't cheat, then the author is perpetuating a false narrative. But in this case, the rumors were already there, and the author didn't see the ex herself. So she's confirming rumors that might not be true.\n\nAlso, the author is now in a relationship with the ex's boyfriend, which could be a conflict of interest. She might have had a personal motive to help him move on, perhaps to strengthen her own relationship with him. But lying to achieve that is problematic. \n\nAdditionally, maintaining the lie could backfire if the truth comes out. Even if there's nothing to gain now, the boyfriend's happiness might be built on a lie. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and the author compromised that by lying. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue she was trying to help him heal. But that's not a valid excuse for lying. The right thing would have been to be honest, even if it was painful. The author's actions might prevent the boyfriend from fully processing his emotions if the truth was different. \n\nSo considering all this, the author is in the wrong because she lied to manipulate his perception, which is a breach of trust regardless of the intent.\n"
