For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author lied to their boyfriend about his ex cheating at a party. The boyfriend was already questioning the breakup, and the author, wanting him to move on, told a lie about seeing the ex with other guys. Now the boyfriend is happier, and the author is conflicted about whether they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's intention was to help the boyfriend move on by confirming his suspicions. But the lie is a big one\u2014accusing someone of cheating. Cheating is a serious issue, so lying about it is a significant ethical problem. The author might have thought they were helping, but they manipulated the situation to get the outcome they wanted.\n\nNow, considering the consequences. The boyfriend is happier because he feels validated in his decision. However, the lie could have long-term repercussions. If the truth ever comes out, it could damage the current relationship. Trust is a cornerstone in any relationship, and lying about such a sensitive topic undermines that trust. Even if the author didn't gain anything from the lie, the act of lying is still a betrayal.\n\nAlso, the author admitted they don't remember seeing the ex at the party. So the lie wasn't based on any real evidence. This makes it even more problematic because there's no factual basis for the accusation. The author's motivation was to help their partner feel better, but using a lie to achieve that is ethically questionable.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, most ethical frameworks would consider lying, especially about something as serious as cheating, as wrong. Intentions might mitigate the blame a bit, but the act itself is still harmful. The author is in a position where they have to maintain the lie, which could lead to more lies in the future, creating a cycle of dishonesty.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the ex. The ex might be falsely accused, which is unfair. Even if the author and the boyfriend have moved on, the lie could affect the ex's reputation and the boyfriend's ability to trust others in the future. The author is essentially deciding someone else's actions and consequences based on a lie.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. They used a lie to manipulate their partner's emotions for their own benefit, even if the intention was to help. The moral responsibility here is to be truthful, even if the truth is uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
