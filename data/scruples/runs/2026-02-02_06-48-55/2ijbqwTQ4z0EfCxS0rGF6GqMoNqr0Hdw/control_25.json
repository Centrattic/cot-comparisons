For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is the asshole here. So, the situation is that the author lied to their boyfriend about his ex cheating to help him move on from the breakup. They were in the same sorority, and the author saw the ex at a party but didn't actually see her cheating. The author told the boyfriend she had seen his ex with other guys, which made him feel better and move on. Now the author is conflicted about whether they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Lying to someone, especially when it affects their emotional state, can be problematic. The author's intention was good\u2014to help their boyfriend feel better\u2014but the means were deceptive. The boyfriend's happiness is a result of this lie, but he might be carrying a false narrative about his ex. If the ex didn't actually cheat, then the author is responsible for perpetuating a misunderstanding that could affect future relationships or interactions with the ex.\n\nThe author might argue that the lie was kind and helped their relationship move forward. However, lies often have consequences. If the boyfriend ever discovers the truth, it could damage his trust in the author. The author is also keeping the lie alive, which means they might have to continue covering up or face the truth. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the ex. The author didn't directly accuse her of cheating but implied it. If the ex is being falsely accused, that's a serious issue. Even if they don't know each other well, it's still a character judgment being made. \n\nIn terms of the author's relationship with their boyfriend, the lie could be seen as manipulative. They wanted him to move on quickly, so they provided information that made it easier for him to do so. However, this manipulation might prevent him from processing the real reasons for the breakup, which could lead to issues later if he ever questions why the breakup happened.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's actions are ethically questionable. While the intent was to help, the method involved deception that could have lasting negative effects. The correct answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
