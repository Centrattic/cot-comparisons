For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their boyfriend about his ex cheating. The situation is that the author knew the ex wasn't there at the party where the rumors started, but they lied to confirm the boyfriend's suspicions. The boyfriend is now happier and has moved on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Lying to someone, even with good intentions, can be harmful. The author's motivation was to help the boyfriend move on, but the lie itself is the key issue here. Honesty is a fundamental aspect of trust in relationships. If the author is keeping up the lie, they might be undermining the trust that the boyfriend has in them. \n\nEven if the boyfriend believes the ex cheated now, the truth could come out later, causing more harm. The boyfriend might feel betrayed when he finds out the lie, leading to bigger issues in their relationship. Also, the author might be justifying the lie because it made the boyfriend happy, but happiness shouldn't be achieved through deceit. \n\nAnother angle is the impact on the ex. If the ex is innocent, the lie is spreading a false narrative about her, which is unfair. The author's decision to lie affects more than just their relationship with the boyfriend. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author's intention was to help someone move on from a breakup, which is a common and relatable situation. But the act of lying itself is morally wrong regardless of the intent. \n\nIn conclusion, even if the intention was good, lying in a relationship is generally considered wrong because it breaches trust and can lead to future problems. The author is in the wrong here."
