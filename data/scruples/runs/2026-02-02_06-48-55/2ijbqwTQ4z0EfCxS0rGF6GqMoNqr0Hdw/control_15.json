For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author started dating her boyfriend in college, after he broke up with his ex. The ex was suspected of cheating at a party based on rumors. The author was at the party but didn't see the ex with others. However, when the boyfriend asked if she saw them, she lied and said she did. This helped him move on from the breakup, making him happier.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key here is the intent and the consequences. The author lied to help her boyfriend feel better, to move on their relationship. But lying is generally considered wrong unless there's a very good reason, like preventing harm. But here, the lie could have long-term consequences if the truth ever comes out. The boyfriend is now certain his ex cheated, which might affect his future relationships or his trust in people. Also, the author is keeping up the lie, which means she's maintaining a falsehood to protect her own interests (her relationship with the current boyfriend).\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, honesty is usually a virtue. Even if the intention was good, lying can erode trust if discovered. The author might be justifying it as a \"white lie,\" but in relationships, trust is crucial. By lying, she's manipulating her boyfriend's perception of the past, which could backfire. If he ever finds out the truth, it might damage their current relationship more than the original breakup.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation was her own desire for the boyfriend to move on, possibly to make their relationship work. But that doesn't negate the fact that she intentionally misled him. Even if he's happier, the lie is still a betrayal of trust. So, the answer would likely be that she's in the wrong because the act of lying is inherently unethical, regardless of the intention.\n"
