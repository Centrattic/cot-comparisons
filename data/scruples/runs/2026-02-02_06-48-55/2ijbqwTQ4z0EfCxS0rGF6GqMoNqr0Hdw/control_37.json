For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author lied to her boyfriend about seeing his ex at a party with other guys, leading him to believe she cheated. The boyfriend was still upset about the breakup and the author wanted him to move on.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author saw the ex at the same party but doesn't remember interacting with her. She lied about seeing her with other guys, which made the boyfriend feel better and move on. Now she's questioning if she made the right choice.\n\nSo, the main issue here is lying. Lying can be morally wrong, especially if it's to deceive someone. But there's also context. The author's intention was to help her boyfriend heal. She had a crush on him for a long time and wanted them to be happy. But lying to him, even with good intentions, might have consequences. \n\nThe boyfriend might not have moved on as quickly if he hadn't believed the lie. However, the author is now feeling guilty. The question is whether her lie was justified. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. Deception, even if well-meaning, can erode trust. Even if there's no immediate harm, if the truth comes out later, it could cause more problems. The author might be in the wrong because she manipulated the situation to make her boyfriend feel better, which isn't her place. \n\nOn the other hand, she was trying to help him through a tough time. But that doesn't justify the lie. People should be able to process breakups on their own without someone else fabricating reasons. The boyfriend might not have been ready to move on, and the lie might have just given him a false sense of closure. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong. The lie, even if intended to help, is still a betrayal of trust. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
