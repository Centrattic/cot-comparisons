For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for lying to their boyfriend about his ex cheating. From the story, they started dating four months ago, and the boyfriend was heartbroken by his ex. The author saw the ex at a party but didn't see any cheating. When asked, they lied and said they saw the ex with other guys, which helped the boyfriend move on.\n\nSo, the main points here are deception and intent. The author's intention was to help their boyfriend feel better by confirming his suspicions. But lying to someone, even with good intentions, can be problematic. The boyfriend might not know the truth, and if he found out, that could hurt their trust. Also, the author is maintaining the lie now, which is part of the problem.\n\nEthically, lying is usually considered wrong because it's a form of deception. Even if the outcome seems positive, the act itself is morally questionable. The author might have thought they were helping, but they're keeping their partner in the dark, which could lead to bigger issues if the truth comes out later. The boyfriend's happiness isn't worth the manipulation of his beliefs through lies. So, the author is in the wrong because they used a lie to influence his emotional state, which is not an acceptable action regardless of the intent.\n"
