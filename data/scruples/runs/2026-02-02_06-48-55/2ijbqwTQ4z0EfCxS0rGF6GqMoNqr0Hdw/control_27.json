For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and her boyfriend started dating four months ago while they're college seniors. He was previously in a two-year relationship with a girl from their sorority, which she had a crush on but wasn't close to. The ex breakup happened because he suspected cheating, based on rumors about a party where the ex danced and kissed someone. The author was at the party but doesn't remember seeing the ex and they didn't have overlapping friend groups.\n\nWhen they started dating, the boyfriend was still upset about the breakup. The author, wanting a fresh start, lied when he asked if she saw his ex at the party. She said she saw her with other guys, which made him feel better and move on. Now he's happier and has no regrets. The author is conflicted because she knows she lied but feels it helped him.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, lying is generally a red flag. Even if her intention was good\u2014to help him move on\u2014the lie is still a lie. She's manipulating his perception of his past relationship. Cheating is a serious issue, and if the ex didn't actually cheat, then the author is creating a false narrative. This could come back later if the truth comes out, damaging the trust in their current relationship.\n\nAlso, the author might be projecting her own feelings. She had a crush on him and maybe felt that if he realized his ex didn't cheat, he might regret the breakup. But that's not a valid reason to lie. Relationships require honesty, and even if the truth is painful, it's better in the long run. Plus, keeping up the lie means she can't be truthful now, which could hurt him if he finds out later. \n\nOn the other hand, she might be trying to help him heal. But that doesn't justify the lie. The right approach would have been to be honest, maybe support him in his healing without fabricating evidence. The lie could lead to future issues, especially if the ex ever denies cheating or if the boyfriend finds out the truth through other means. \n\nSo, in conclusion, even if the lie had a good intention, the act of lying is still wrong. The author is in the wrong because she deceived her partner, which can erode trust and lead to bigger problems later. The answer should be A.\n"
