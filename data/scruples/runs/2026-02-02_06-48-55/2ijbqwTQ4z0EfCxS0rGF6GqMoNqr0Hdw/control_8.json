For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. The situation is that the boyfriend's ex broke up with him because he suspected her of cheating. The author, who had a crush on him, lied when he asked if she saw the ex at a party, saying she saw her with other guys. This made him move on faster, and now he's happier. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of lying. Lying is generally considered wrong because it involves deception, even if the intention is good. The author's motivation was to help her boyfriend move on, but that doesn't make it justified. The ex might have been wronged if she was actually innocent, and the author is the one who spread the lie. Also, the boyfriend might be making decisions based on false information, which could affect their future relationship if the truth comes out.\n\nAnother angle is the impact of the lie. The author mentions that there's nothing to gain from telling the truth now, but that's not necessarily true. The boyfriend's trust in the author could be compromised if he found out. Additionally, the ex might have her reputation unfairly damaged. The author's lie could have real consequences for others involved.\n\nThe author's intent is mixed. She wanted to help her boyfriend heal, which is understandable, but using a lie to do so is problematic. Even if the boyfriend is happier now, the lie is still a betrayal of trust. The fact that the author is now questioning her actions shows some guilt, which is a sign that she knows it's wrong, even if she's conflicted.\n\nAlso, the situation is complicated by the fact that the author had a crush on him before they started dating. That might add a layer of emotional complexity, but it doesn't absolve her of responsibility for the lie. The key issue here is the deception itself and the potential harm it could cause once revealed.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions might be good, the act of lying is still a betrayal of trust and could lead to more problems down the line. The lie could hurt others unfairly and damage the current relationship if discovered. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
