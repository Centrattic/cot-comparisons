For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. The situation is that the boyfriend broke up with his ex because he suspected she cheated, based on rumors. The author, who had a crush on him, was at the party but didn't see the ex with anyone. When asked, she lied and said she saw her with other guys, which made him move on faster. Now she's questioning if she did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Lying is generally seen as wrong because it betrays trust. The author lied to her boyfriend about something that affected his emotional state regarding his past relationship. Even though her intention was to help him move on, the lie was still a deliberate act to manipulate his perception. \n\nNext, the consequences. The boyfriend is now happier, but the lie could backfire if discovered. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and lying can erode that foundation. Even if there's no immediate gain, the long-term effects could be damaging. The author might be justifying the lie because it made him happy, but happiness achieved through deceit isn't sustainable.\n\nAlso, the author's own feelings of guilt suggest she knows on some level that what she did was wrong. The fact that she's seeking validation implies internal conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that her intention was good. She wanted to help him move on, but intentions don't absolve the action of lying. The means (lying) to achieve a good end (his happiness) is ethically questionable. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is typically prioritized. Without truth, misunderstandings and further lies can pile up. The author might now face a dilemma if the truth comes to light, which could hurt both her and her boyfriend.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is in the wrong because she lied to manipulate his perception, even if the intent was to help. The lie, while well-meaning, is still a breach of trust and could lead to long-term issues in the relationship.\n"
