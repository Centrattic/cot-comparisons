For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to their boyfriend about his ex cheating. Let me break this down.\n\nSo, the context is that the author and their boyfriend started dating four months ago. The boyfriend's previous relationship ended because he suspected his ex cheated at a party. The author was at the party but didn't see the ex. When the boyfriend asked if she saw the ex, the author lied and said she saw her with other guys. This made the boyfriend feel better and move on faster. Now, the author is conflicted about whether they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, the key points here are deception and the impact of that lie. Lying is generally a bad thing, but the intent and consequences matter. The author's intention was to help the boyfriend move on from his ex, which seems to have worked. But the boyfriend was misled, and there's no actual proof of cheating. The author is now questioning if they're the asshole (ITA).\n\nThe ethical angle here is tricky. On one hand, the lie didn't cause harm to the ex, but it did involve betrayal of trust with the boyfriend. Relationships require honesty, and lying, even with good intentions, can erode trust if discovered. The author might face consequences if the truth comes out later. Also, the boyfriend's feelings are important, but so is the author's integrity.\n\nAnother angle: the author had a crush on the boyfriend for a long time but waited until the ex left. Now that they're together, the author's lie could be seen as manipulative. Even if the boyfriend is happier, the lie was a means to an end. The author might have crossed a line by not being truthful. \n\nHowever, the alternative is that the author was trying to help the boyfriend heal. But in relationships, honesty is usually the best policy. If the boyfriend finds out the truth, he might feel betrayed, which could damage the new relationship. The author is in a tough spot, but lying to manipulate someone's perception, even for a good reason, is typically considered wrong.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). The lie, regardless of intent, was a betrayal of trust and could have long-term negative effects. Even if the immediate outcome was positive, the ethical responsibility to be truthful makes the author at fault.\n"
