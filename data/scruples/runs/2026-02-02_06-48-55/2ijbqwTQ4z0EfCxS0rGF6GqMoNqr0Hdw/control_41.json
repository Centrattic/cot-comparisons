For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style story is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the main points of the story: The author started dating her boyfriend in college after he broke up with his ex because he suspected cheating. The ex was in the same sorority but they weren't close. At a party, there were rumors, but the author didn't actually see the ex cheating. When the boyfriend asked if she saw them at the party, she lied and said she did. Now, he's moved on, and the author is questioning if she's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key issue here is intentionally lying to make someone feel better. The author's motivation was to help her boyfriend move on from a breakup by confirming his suspicions, even if there was no evidence. The lie seems to have made him happier, but the question is whether the lie is justified.\n\nI need to consider the ethics of lying in this context. Lying generally goes against honesty, which is a foundational part of trust in relationships. Even if the intention was good (helping him move on), the act of lying could lead to consequences down the line. For example, if the truth were to come out later, it could damage their relationship. Also, the ex might be wrongly accused, which could affect her reputation or future relationships.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that the lie was harmless and for a good cause. The boyfriend is happier and has no regrets, so maybe the end justifies the means. But then again, lying to manipulate someone's emotions, even with good intentions, is still a lie. There's also the aspect of not knowing whether the ex actually cheated. Without evidence, the author is essentially confirming a suspicion as fact, which isn't fair to either person involved.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions might prevent her boyfriend from re-evaluating his feelings or the reasons behind the breakup. If the ex didn't cheat, then he might have been wrong about her, and the lie prevents him from learning that. However, in this case, the ex might have indeed cheated, given the rumors, but the author didn't witness it. The line between lying and sharing incomplete information is tricky here.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is the one who chose to fabricate information rather than tell the truth. Even if there's no immediate harm, the act of lying is inherently wrong in many ethical frameworks. The author is in a position where she could have said she didn't know or that there were rumors without confirming the cheating. Choosing to lie to provide closure is a breach of honesty.\n\nAdditionally, the author's guilt suggests that she feels the lie is wrong, which might indicate her own moral compass is telling her it's not right. The fact that she's seeking feedback implies she's conflicted, which usually means she's aware of the potential wrongdoing.\n\nSo, considering all these points: the lie was intentional, it manipulated her boyfriend's perception of the breakup, it could wrongly accuse the ex, and it sets a precedent of dishonesty in the relationship. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
