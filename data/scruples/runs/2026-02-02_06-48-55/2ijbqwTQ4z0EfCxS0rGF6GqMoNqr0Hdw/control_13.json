For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex possibly cheating. The situation is that the boyfriend's ex broke up with him because he suspected she cheated. The author, wanting him to move on, lied about seeing the ex with other guys at a party, which made him feel better and confirm his suspicions. Now, she's conflicted because she knows the truth but doesn't want to tell him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical aspects. Lying to someone, even if with good intentions, is generally considered wrong. The author's motivation was to help her boyfriend move on, but deception can erode trust once discovered. Even if the lie helped him feel better in the short term, the long-term consequences could be damaging to their relationship. Trust is a cornerstone of any relationship, so lying about something as serious as infidelity could lead to bigger issues.\n\nAlso, the author is in a position where revealing the truth might hurt her boyfriend again, but keeping the lie could mean she's complicit in a falsehood that might resurface later. The boyfriend's happiness is important, but it shouldn't be built on a lie. The author's actions were manipulative, as she's controlling the narrative to her advantage, even if unintentionally.\n\nAnother angle is the potential harm if the ex was actually innocent. If the ex didn't cheat, then the author's lie perpetuates a false narrative that could affect others. However, the question is more about the author's wrongdoing in her relationship with her boyfriend. The key point here is the betrayal of trust by lying to him, regardless of the ex's actions.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. Even with the best intentions, lying to a partner can lead to a breakdown of trust. The author's actions, while perhaps stemming from a place of wanting to help, are still a deliberate deception. The fact that she's now conflicted shows that she's aware of the moral weight of her actions.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because she lied to her partner, which is a breach of trust and honesty. The consequences of the lie could affect their relationship's integrity moving forward.\n"
