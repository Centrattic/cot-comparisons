For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. The situation is that the author told her boyfriend that his ex was cheating at a party, even though she didn't see it. She did this to help him move on from the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Lying is generally considered wrong because it breaches trust. The author's intention was to make her boyfriend feel better, but lying about such a serious matter (cheating) could have serious consequences. Cheating is a major betrayal, so fabricating that information could be seen as deceitful.\n\nNext, the impact on the boyfriend. He's using the lie to feel better, and he's happier now. But if he finds out the truth later, it could hurt him even more. The author is maintaining the lie, which means she's continuously deceiving him. This could affect their relationship's trust if the truth ever comes out.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation. She had a crush on him and wanted to see him happy. But helping someone by lying isn't a valid justification. Even with good intentions, lying is still a harmful act. The boyfriend might have made decisions based on that lie, like moving on from the relationship definitively.\n\nMoreover, the author is keeping the lie going. There's no indication that she plans to tell the truth, which means she's complicit in maintaining a falsehood. This could lead to future issues if the ex finds out or if the boyfriend discovers the truth later.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. By lying, the author is setting a precedent that could undermine the trust between her and her boyfriend. Even if the lie was meant to help, it's still a lie that could have long-term negative effects.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author's intentions were good, and since the lie helped him move on, maybe it's not entirely her fault. But the act of lying itself is still unethical regardless of the outcome. The line between helping and hurting is crossed when dishonesty is used as a means.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. The lie, even with good intentions, is a betrayal of trust and could cause more harm in the long run. The answer should be A.\n"
