For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. The situation is that the author lied to her boyfriend, making him believe his ex cheated, which helped him move on from the breakup. The author didn't know for sure if the ex actually cheated and the ex wasn't at the party as far as she knows.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Lying to someone, even if with good intentions, can have serious consequences. The author's motivation was to help her boyfriend feel better, but the lie might have caused him unnecessary pain. If the ex didn't actually cheat, then the author is making up something that could harm the ex's reputation, even if it's just between the two of them. \n\nAlso, trust is a fundamental part of a relationship. If the author lied to her boyfriend, even if it was to help him move on, there's a risk that this lie could come back and destroy their relationship. The boyfriend might feel betrayed if he ever finds out the truth. The author might be justifying it now because it helped him move on, but it's a dangerous precedent. \n\nAnother angle is the intention. The author did it out of a desire to help her boyfriend, but that doesn't necessarily excuse the lie. People often think they are helping by lying, but the truth can have more lasting effects. The author might also be projecting her own feelings of guilt or wanting to erase the ex's influence, but that's no reason to fabricate a story.\n\nThe fact that the author is now seeking validation or reassurance suggests she's conflicted. Even if there's no immediate harm, the lie itself is unethical. The boyfriend's happiness shouldn't be built on a falsehood. Moreover, the author might have assumed a role in making decisions for her boyfriend about his past relationship, which isn't his to make.\n\nIn summary, while the intention was to help, the act of lying is morally wrong. The author is in the wrong because she fabricated a situation that led her boyfriend to believe his ex cheated without any evidence. This kind of deceit can undermine the trust in their current relationship and potentially cause long-term damage.\n"
