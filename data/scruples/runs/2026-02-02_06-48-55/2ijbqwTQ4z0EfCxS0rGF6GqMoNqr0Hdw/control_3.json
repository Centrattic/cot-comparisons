For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. The scenario is that the author saw the ex at a party where there were rumors of her cheating, but she didn't actually see any evidence. She told her boyfriend she saw her with other guys, which made him move on faster. Now she's questioning if she did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Lying to someone, especially in a relationship, can definitely be problematic. The author's intention was to help her boyfriend move on, but the lie was about a serious accusation\u2014cheating. Cheating is a major issue, and making up such information can have far-reaching consequences. \n\nThe boyfriend was already dealing with the breakup, and the lie might have given him closure. But here's the catch: he didn't actually have evidence of cheating before the lie. The author's lie became the \"evidence\" he used to justify the breakup. Now, if he later finds out the truth, it could damage his trust in the author and possibly affect their relationship. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. That's a red flag. If the lie is making her boyfriend happy, but it's not based in reality, it's a harmful lie. Even if she intended to help, the lie was still a manipulation of his emotions. \n\nAnother angle: relationships require honesty and trust. By lying, the author is compromising those foundations. Even if the motive was good, the act of lying is still deceitful. The boyfriend might not have moved on as quickly without the lie, but the truth is important for a healthy relationship. \n\nThe author's justification is that she wanted a fresh start, but using a lie to achieve that is ethically questionable. It's possible that her actions were selfish, even if well-intentioned. She might have prioritized her own emotional needs over her boyfriend's right to the truth. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the boyfriend's emotional well-being was a concern. But the line between helping and harming is thin here. The lie could backfire if the truth comes out later. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author did commit a lie with potentially serious consequences. The fact that she's now conflicted shows that she knows it's wrong. The ethical stance here would lean towards the author being in the wrong because honesty is a cornerstone in relationships. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
