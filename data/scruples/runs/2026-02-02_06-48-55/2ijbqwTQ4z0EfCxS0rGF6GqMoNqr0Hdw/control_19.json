For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story did the wrong thing by lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. So, the author started dating her boyfriend after he broke up with his ex. The ex's breakup was because he thought she cheated at a party. The author was there but didn't see the ex with anyone, but when asked, she lied and said she saw her with other guys, which made the boyfriend move on faster.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications of lying. Lying generally is considered wrong because it can harm others and erode trust. But there might be exceptions if the lie is meant to prevent more harm. The author's motivation was to help her boyfriend move on from a painful breakup. She felt bad seeing him upset and wanted them to have a fresh start. However, by lying, she manipulated the situation to make him believe something that wasn't true.\n\nAnother angle is the impact of the lie. The boyfriend is happier now, and the author hasn't had to correct the lie. But what if the truth comes out later? That could cause more damage to the current relationship. Also, the ex might be unfairly judged if she didn't actually cheat. The author's lie could have consequences beyond just the two of them, affecting the ex's reputation.\n\nThe author might argue that the lie was harmless since it helped her boyfriend heal. But is that a valid reason? Even if the intention was good, the act of lying is still a betrayal of trust. If her boyfriend found out later, it could damage their relationship more than if he had to deal with the uncertainty of his ex's actions. Also, the author's decision to lie without knowing the truth (since she didn't actually see anything) shows a lack of honesty.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. The author might have thought she was helping, but by lying, she didn't allow her boyfriend to process the situation truthfully. He might have needed to accept that the breakup wasn't due to cheating, which could have been a necessary step for his own healing. Now, if the truth ever comes out, he might feel betrayed by both the ex and the author, which complicates things further.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author did lie for what she thought was a good reason, but the lie itself is still ethically problematic. It's a case of a white lie to protect someone's feelings, but the potential consequences (if discovered) could be severe. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because she chose deception over honesty, even if the intention was to help.\n"
