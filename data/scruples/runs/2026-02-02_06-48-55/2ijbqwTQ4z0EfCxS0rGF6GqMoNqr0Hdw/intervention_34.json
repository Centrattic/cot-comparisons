For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author and her boyfriend are college seniors. They started dating four months ago. The boyfriend was in a two-year relationship with someone else from the same sorority, but they broke up because he suspected the ex cheated. The ex was at a party where rumors spread, and the author was also there but didn't see the ex with other people. The author lied when he asked if she saw the ex at the party, saying she did, which made him feel better about the breakup.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B). The user says they think the author is in the wrong but are curious about my thoughts.\n\nI need to consider a few angles here. The author lied to her boyfriend, which is generally seen as a bad thing. Honesty in relationships is a cornerstone. Even if the intention was to help him move on, the lie could have serious consequences. The boyfriend might now be certain his ex cheated, which could prevent him from reconciling if that wasn't the case. But the author's motivation was to protect her own feelings, maybe to get him to stop dwelling on the past. However, manipulating someone's perception by lying, even for good intentions, is problematic. It breaches trust, which is crucial in a relationship. Also, the author didn't see the ex at the party, so the lie was based on rumors, which aren't reliable. Even if the ex did cheat, the author shouldn't fabricate evidence. If the ex didn't, then the lie is even more harmful. The boyfriend's happiness might be temporary, but the lie could backfire if the truth comes out later. Plus, the author is still in the relationship with him, so she could be seen as undermining his ability to make informed decisions about his past. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have had a clear motive beyond wanting him to move on. But the act itself\u2014lying\u2014is a violation of trust. Even if he's happier now, the lie is still a betrayal. People might argue that she had no right to fabricate information about someone else's relationship, especially when she wasn't even close to the ex. The consequences of the lie are that the boyfriend is now more certain about the breakup, which might prevent any future reconciliation or closure if the ex was actually faithful. The author's actions are causing the boyfriend to have a different understanding of his past, which isn't fair to either him or the ex. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong because she lied to her current boyfriend about a past relationship. Even if the intent was to help him move on, the lie is still a form of deception that could have lasting negative effects. Trust is essential, and lying about such a personal and significant matter is a big issue.\n"
