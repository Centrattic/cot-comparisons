For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for lying to their boyfriend about his ex cheating. So, the situation is that they started dating in college, and before that, the boyfriend was with another girl. They broke up because he suspected she cheated, based on rumors from a party. The writer was at the party but didn't see the ex with anyone. When he asked, she lied and said she did see her with other guys, which helped him move on. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nHmm. Well, lying is generally considered wrong. The main issue here is intent. She lied to make him feel better and move on. But the problem is that she's fabricating information that isn't true. Even if the intention was good, the act of lying can have consequences. For one, if he ever found out the truth, it could damage their trust. Also, manipulating the truth for his benefit might not be ethical. Even if there's no gain for her, the lie itself is still a form of deceit. People have the right to know the truth, especially about their past relationships. Also, the fact that she's keeping up the lie now means she's maintaining a falsehood, which could lead to more problems later. So, even though her motive was to help him heal, the act of lying is still wrong. The answer is A.\n"
