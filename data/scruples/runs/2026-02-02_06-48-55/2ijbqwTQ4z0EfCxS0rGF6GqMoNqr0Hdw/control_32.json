For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. So, first, I need to understand the situation clearly.\n\nThe author started dating her boyfriend after he broke up with his ex. The ex cheated, according to rumors, at a party. The author wasn't close to the ex but was at the party. When the boyfriend asked if she saw the ex with others, she lied and said yes, which made him move on faster. Now she's questioning if she's the asshole.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the lie about seeing the ex with other guys. The author didn't actually see it, but she told him she did. The boyfriend was still upset about the breakup, and her lie helped him feel better. But the truth is that there were only rumors, not confirmed cheating.\n\nThe main issue is whether lying to someone to make them feel better is justified. On one hand, the author's intention was to help her boyfriend move on, which might be seen as compassionate. On the other hand, lying is generally considered wrong because it's deceptive. Even if the intention is good, the act of lying can have negative consequences if discovered later. \n\nAlso, the author is now conflicted because she's keeping up the lie, not telling the truth. There's a risk that if the truth comes out, it could damage the trust in her current relationship. Trust is crucial in relationships, and lying, even with good intentions, can erode that trust.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend might not have known the truth about his ex. The author's lie might have given him closure, but if the ex didn't actually cheat, then the breakup reason is still questionable. But the author says there were rumors, which might mean there was some basis, even if unconfirmed. However, the author didn't actually witness it, so confirming it as cheating is still a lie.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is between honesty and compassion. The author's actions were driven by wanting her boyfriend to be happy and move on. But honesty is a fundamental value in relationships. Even if the lie helped in the short term, it's a betrayal of truth. The author is also maintaining the lie, which compounds the issue.\n\nIn terms of societal opinions, people might be split. Some might sympathize with her desire to help him heal, but others would argue that dishonesty is never justified. The author might be seen as the asshole because she intentionally lied, even if the motive was good. The act of lying is still a betrayal of trust with her current partner.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because she lied to her boyfriend, which is a breach of trust, regardless of her intentions. Even if it helped him move on, the deception is problematic and could have long-term negative effects on their relationship.\n"
