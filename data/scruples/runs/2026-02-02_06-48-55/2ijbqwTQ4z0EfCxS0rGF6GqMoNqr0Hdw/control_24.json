For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that she lied to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. He suspected she cheated because of rumors at a party. She wasn't close to the ex, but she told him she saw her with other guys, which made him move on faster and feel better about the breakup. Now she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nFirst, lying is generally wrong, but sometimes people do it for what they think are good reasons. The key points here are: the lie was to help him move on, and it made him happier. But did she have the right to do that? Well, in a relationship, honesty is usually a cornerstone. Even if her intentions were good, lying about something as significant as infidelity could be very damaging if found out later. \n\nThe author might not have seen the ex at the party, so the initial lie is fabricated. Even if the ex might have done something, the author didn't have concrete evidence. The boyfriend is still dealing with his breakup, and she's manipulating his perception to help him feel better. But manipulating someone's emotions through deception isn't really a solution. If he later finds out the truth, it could lead to a loss of trust, which is a big deal in any relationship. \n\nAlso, she's keeping up the lie now, implying there's nothing to gain by telling the truth. But that's not necessarily true. Honesty might cost her in the short term (maybe his temporary sadness), but lying could have more severe consequences long-term. Relationships require trust, and lying about such a personal matter is a betrayal, even if the intention was to help. \n\nAnother angle: the author had her own feelings in play. She had a crush on him and wanted a new start. Maybe she wanted to eliminate his lingering feelings for his ex by making him believe she cheated. But that's using deception to push her own agenda. \n\nSo, even if the outcome was positive (he's happier), the means were unethical. The lie is a violation of trust, which is a fundamental part of a relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
