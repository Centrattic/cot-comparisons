For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for lying to their boyfriend about his ex cheating. The situation is that the author didn't see the ex at the party but told the boyfriend she was there with other guys. The boyfriend used that info to move on from the breakup, feeling better about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of lying. Lying is generally considered wrong because it's deceptive and can harm others. Even if the intention was good\u2014like helping him move on\u2014it's still a lie. The boyfriend might not have processed the breakup correctly if the information was fabricated. Also, maintaining the lie means the author is complicit in a falsehood, which could backfire if the truth ever comes out. That could damage trust in their current relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation was to help the boyfriend heal. But the right approach would have been to be honest and maybe support him through his feelings without lying. The lie, even if well-meaning, could prevent the boyfriend from addressing any unresolved issues with the ex, like if the breakup was mutual or due to other reasons. Also, the author might be projecting their own insecurities about starting a new relationship, using the lie to speed up the healing process instead of dealing with the boyfriend's emotions openly.\n\nSo, the key points are: lying is unethical regardless of intent, the lie could have long-term negative effects on both relationships, and there's no justification for the lie since it's not protecting someone from harm but rather helping the author's own peace of mind. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
