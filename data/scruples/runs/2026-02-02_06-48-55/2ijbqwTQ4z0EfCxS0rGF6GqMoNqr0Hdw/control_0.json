For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is in a new relationship with her boyfriend, who was previously in a two-year relationship that ended because he suspected his ex cheated. The author attended a party where the ex was supposedly present, and she told the boyfriend she saw the ex with other guys. The boyfriend took that as confirmation she cheated, which helped him move on. The author is now questioning if she was wrong to lie.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the lie and its consequences. The author didn't actually see the ex with other people. She lied to help her boyfriend feel better. The boyfriend is now happier and has moved on because of this lie.\n\nNow, considering the ethics of lying. Lying is generally considered wrong because it's deceptive. Even if the intention was to help the other person, the act of lying is still a betrayal of trust. The author is keeping up the lie, not correcting it, so if the truth comes out, it could hurt the boyfriend. Even if she doesn't gain anything, the lie is still there.\n\nAlso, in relationships, honesty is crucial. The author's lie might have helped the boyfriend short-term, but it's a harmful lie. If the ex didn't actually cheat, the boyfriend was wronged by both the ex and the author. The author is essentially playing a role in a false narrative that could affect the boyfriend's perception of both his ex and his current relationship.\n\nAnother angle: the author had a crush on him before, so maybe she wanted to help the relationship by making him feel better. But that doesn't justify lying. The boyfriend's happiness shouldn't be built on a lie, especially if the truth could come out later and cause more harm.\n\nAlso, the author didn't see the ex at the party, so even if the ex did cheat, the author's statement isn't factual. It's possible she's spreading rumors or misinformation without evidence. That's another layer of the problem.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the intention was good, the act of lying and perpetuating the lie is wrong. The author used deception to manipulate the boyfriend's feelings, which is unethical. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
