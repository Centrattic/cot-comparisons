For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. The author knew the ex was at a party where rumors were that she cheated, but she didn't actually see her cheating. When the boyfriend asked if she saw the ex with other guys, she lied and said yes, which made him move on faster. Now she's conflicted because he's happier but she's lying.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the author lied to her boyfriend, the lie was about a serious accusation (cheating), and the lie was intended to help him move on. The question is whether this makes her the asshole (ITA).\n\nEthically, lying is generally considered wrong, especially when it's a significant issue like cheating. Cheating allegations can have serious consequences on a person's emotional state and trust in relationships. The author's lie was not for her own benefit but to make her boyfriend feel better. However, the intent doesn't necessarily excuse the lie. Even if the motive was good, the act of lying is still deceptive and could lead to problems down the line. \n\nAdditionally, the author was in a position where she had information (or lack thereof) that could affect someone else's perception of a past relationship. By providing false information, she's essentially manipulating his understanding of his own history, which can be seen as a betrayal of trust in their current relationship. The fact that the boyfriend is now happier might seem like a positive outcome, but the lie could come back to haunt them if the truth ever comes out. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and without it, the foundation is weak.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author had a responsibility to tell the truth. Even if the truth was uncomfortable, she should have been honest about not seeing anything. Lying to confirm the boyfriend's suspicions, even if they were already leaning that way, still crosses a line. It's possible the ex didn't cheat, and the author's lie could prevent the boyfriend from ever getting closure if that's the case. Also, if the boyfriend had known the author lied, it could damage their current relationship.\n\nThe author's justification is that the lie helped him move on and he's happier. But happiness derived from a lie is not sustainable. The moral wrong here is the act of deception, regardless of the outcome. People can sometimes be in denial about their own behavior when they feel guilty, so it's important to assess the lie's impact on the relationship's integrity.\n\nIn conclusion, even with good intentions, the author's lie is a betrayal of trust and ethically wrong. The answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
