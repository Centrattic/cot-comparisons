For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she lied to her boyfriend about seeing his ex with other guys at a party, making him believe the ex cheated. He was still upset about the breakup, and her lie made him feel better and move on faster.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of lying. Lying is generally considered wrong because it's deceptive and can harm others. But sometimes people lie for what they think are good reasons, like to protect someone's feelings. However, in this case, the lie was about a significant issue\u2014cheating in a past relationship. That's a serious matter, and fabricating evidence of infidelity is a big deal.\n\nThe author's intention was to help her boyfriend move on and feel better. While her intentions might be good, the method she used is questionable. By lying, she manipulated his perception of the breakup. Even if he was still hurting, lying about such a critical event can have long-term consequences. For example, if the ex actually didn't cheat, the boyfriend might have closure but based on a falsehood. That could affect his future relationships if he discovers the truth eventually. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, and lies, even if well-intentioned, can erode that trust if they ever come to light.\n\nAlso, the author might be rationalizing her actions by saying that there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. That implies she's aware the truth could hurt him again, but keeping the lie might prevent that. However, this creates a moral dilemma. She's choosing to maintain a lie to avoid short-term pain for him, but at the cost of honesty in their relationship. If her boyfriend ever finds out, it could damage their relationship more than the initial truth would have.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the author herself. She says it's been eating her up inside, which suggests guilt. That guilt is a sign that she knows her actions are morally questionable. Even if the lie helped him move on, the internal conflict and the potential for future issues make the lie problematic.\n\nIn summary, while the author had good intentions, the act of lying about a serious matter like infidelity is a breach of trust and honesty. The long-term effects of such a lie, even if it seemed helpful in the short term, are likely more harmful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
