For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. The situation is that she saw the ex at a party but didn't see her with other people. However, she told her boyfriend she did, which made him move on faster.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author lied to her boyfriend, which is a big issue. She did this to help him move on from his ex, but that's not a valid reason to lie. Lying, even with good intentions, can damage trust. Relationships require honesty, and the fact that she's keeping up the lie means she's maintaining a falsehood. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend is now happier believing his ex cheated, but that's because of a lie. If the truth ever comes out, it could cause more harm. The author might be justifying the lie because it made him happy, but lies can backfire. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation was to help him move on. She had a crush on him for a while and wanted a fresh start. But that doesn't excuse the lie. There's no good reason to create a falsehood, even if the intent was good. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer here is probably yes because lying is inherently wrong in a relationship. Trust is foundational, and once broken, it's hard to rebuild. Even if the lie helped him move on, the ethical thing would be to tell the truth. \n\nSo the answer should be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
