For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. The situation is that they started dating four months ago, and before that, he was with someone else. The author saw a party where rumors were that his ex cheated. She wasn't close to the ex, but she lied when he asked if she saw her with other guys. Now, the boyfriend is happier believing his ex cheated, and the author is conflicted about whether she did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the lie was justified. The author's intention was to help her boyfriend move on. She had a crush on him for a long time and wanted a new start. However, lying about seeing his ex with others is a significant act. Cheating is a serious issue, and fabricating such a story could be considered deceitful. \n\nThe key here is the impact of the lie. The boyfriend is now happier and has moved on, but he's been misled. Even if the outcome is positive, the act of lying for personal gain (to help her own relationship) might be seen as unethical. Also, lies can backfire or cause harm later if discovered. The author might be avoiding the truth, which could lead to trust issues down the line. \n\nAnother angle is the lack of concrete evidence. The author mentions rumors and that she didn't actually see the ex with other people. By lying, she's taking a rumor and turning it into a fact, which is manipulative. Even though she might not have known for sure, she made up something to confirm his suspicions. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. The author is in a position where she's using information to influence her partner's perception of a past relationship. This could be seen as using deceit to make her current relationship look better. Even if her intentions were good, the means were dishonest. \n\nAlso, the fact that there's no gain in telling the truth now doesn't absolve her of the lie. The right thing to do is to be truthful, regardless of the consequences. The author's justification is that her boyfriend is happier, but that doesn't make the lie right. People have a right to know the truth about their past relationships, even if it's painful. \n\nConsidering all these points, the lie was an intentional act of deception, even if well-intentioned. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
