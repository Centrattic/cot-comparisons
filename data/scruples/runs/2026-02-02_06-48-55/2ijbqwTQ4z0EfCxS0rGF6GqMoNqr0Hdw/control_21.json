For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to their boyfriend about his ex cheating. The scenario is that the author and their boyfriend started dating four months ago. The boyfriend's previous relationship ended because he suspected the ex cheated, based on rumors. The author attended a party where the rumors happened but didn't actually see the ex cheating. However, when the boyfriend asked if the author saw the ex with other guys, they lied and said yes to help him move on. Now the boyfriend is happier, and the author is wondering if they're an asshole for lying.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if lying to someone, even with good intentions, is wrong. The key points here are the intent and the consequences. The author's motive was to help their boyfriend feel better and move on. However, lying can damage trust in a relationship. The boyfriend might find out later, which could cause more harm than good. Also, the author is keeping the lie going, which means they haven't told the truth yet. \n\nEthically, honesty is usually considered a virtue. Even if the intention was good, the lie was to manipulate the boyfriend's perception of his ex. The author might be in the wrong because they interfered with his ability to process the breakup truthfully. If the ex didn't actually cheat, the author's lie could prevent the boyfriend from reflecting on other reasons for the breakup, like personal issues or incompatibility. Also, if the truth ever comes out, the boyfriend might feel betrayed, which could damage their current relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the harm caused by the lie. The author claims the boyfriend is happier now, but happiness built on a lie is temporary. It's possible that the boyfriend is avoiding dealing with the real issues of the break-up, which might resurface later. The author's lie could prevent him from learning from past relationships, which isn't healthy. \n\nAdditionally, the author is keeping the lie going, which shows they're aware of the deception and choosing to continue it. This suggests a lack of accountability. Even if the author thought it was for the best, the lie is still a betrayal of trust. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. The author should have been honest from the beginning. If the boyfriend needed help moving on, the author could have supported him without lying. Maybe encouraging him to focus on their relationship or seeking his closure through other means. The lie might have provided a quick fix but at the expense of long-term trust.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong. The lie, despite good intentions, is a betrayal and could lead to future problems. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
