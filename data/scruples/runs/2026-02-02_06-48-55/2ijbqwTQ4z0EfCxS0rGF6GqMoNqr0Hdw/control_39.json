For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for lying to their boyfriend about his ex cheating. The situation involves the author lying to help their boyfriend move on from a breakup. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and her boyfriend started dating four months ago. His ex, who he was with for two years, broke up because he suspected cheating based on rumors. The author was at the party but didn't see the ex. When asked, the author lied and said she saw the ex with other guys, which made the boyfriend move on faster. Now, she's conflicted because her boyfriend is happier, but she's lying about it.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the ethical angles here. Lying is generally considered wrong because it breaches trust. However, the context matters. The author's intention was to help her boyfriend heal, not to gain anything for herself. But even if the intention is good, the act of lying is still deceitful.\n\nAnother angle is the impact. The boyfriend is happier, but if he later finds out the truth, that could severely damage his trust in the author. Even if there's no immediate harm, the potential for future harm exists. Also, the author might be justifying the lie because it worked out for her boyfriend, but that's a form of consequentialism, where the outcome justifies the action. However, deontological ethics would say that lying is wrong regardless of the consequences.\n\nAdditionally, the author is maintaining the lie, which means they might have to keep up the story if confronted, leading to more lies. This could create a cycle of deception. The boyfriend's happiness now might be built on a false premise. If the ex actually didn't cheat, then the breakup might have been for a different reason, which the boyfriend is now ignoring because of the lie. The author might be preventing her boyfriend from addressing any real issues in his past relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had a crush on him and wanted a new start, so the motivation isn't entirely selfish. She might have felt that the lie was a kindness to help him move on. But even so, the lie still infringes on the boyfriend's right to the truth. People have a right to know the facts about their past relationships, and fabricating events, even with good intentions, can be harmful in the long run.\n\nConsidering all this, the consensus would likely be that the author is in the wrong. The lie, regardless of intention, undermines trust and could lead to bigger problems. Even if the outcome is positive now, the act itself is unethical. So the answer is A.\n"
