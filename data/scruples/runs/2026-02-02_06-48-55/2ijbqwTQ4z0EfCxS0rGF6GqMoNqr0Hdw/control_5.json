For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves lying to their boyfriend about his ex potentially cheating. The writer didn't actually see the ex with other people but told the boyfriend she did, which helped him move on. The question is if that's the wrong thing to do.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Lying to someone is generally considered wrong because it breaches trust and can cause harm. But in this case, the lie helped the boyfriend heal faster. However, the motivation was to make him feel better, not to deceive him for personal gain. But the key point is whether the lie was justified.\n\nThe writer might argue that they had good intentions. They wanted the boyfriend to move on, and the lie served that purpose. But others might say that the truth should always come out, even if it's painful. Also, maintaining a lie could lead to more complications if the truth ever comes to light. The boyfriend might find out later that the ex wasn't actually cheating, which could damage the new relationship's trust.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on their current relationship. If the boyfriend finds out about the lie, it could hurt him deeply because the foundation of his moving on was built on a falsehood. Even if the writer's intentions were good, the act of lying is a betrayal of trust. In relationships, honesty is crucial. The writer's decision to lie, even for a kind reason, might be seen as manipulative.\n\nAlso, the writer might be avoiding dealing with their own feelings. Instead of addressing why they were stung by the boyfriend's lingering feelings for his ex, they chose to lie. That could indicate deeper issues in their communication in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the writer's actions were compassionate, helping someone who was emotionally hurting. But the problem is that they didn't have the truth. They didn't actually witness the cheating, so fabricating evidence is a step further. It's not just omitting the truth but actively creating a false narrative.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intentions were to help, the act of lying is still a breach of trust. The writer's actions could lead to future problems if discovered, and intentionally deceiving someone, even with good intentions, is generally considered unethical. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
