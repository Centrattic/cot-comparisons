For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. So, the situation is that the author's boyfriend broke up with his ex because he thought she cheated, based on rumors from a party. The author was at the party but doesn't remember seeing the ex. When the boyfriend asked if she saw the ex with other guys, she lied and said yes, which made him feel better and move on faster.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if lying is wrong in this context. Lying is generally considered unethical, but there might be mitigating factors. The author's intention was to help her boyfriend feel better and move on. But did she have a right to lie for that purpose?\n\nThe boyfriend was still upset about the breakup, and the author wanted a fresh start. However, lying to someone, even for good intentions, can have consequences. The boyfriend is now happy because he believes his ex cheated, but the truth might be different. The ex might not have cheated, and the author's lie could have caused the boyfriend to come to a false conclusion about the breakup.\n\nThe author argues that there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now because the boyfriend is happier. But lying, even if it's to help someone feel better, can erode trust if the truth ever comes out. Also, the author is in a position where she didn't actually witness the cheating, so her lie is based on rumors, not facts.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is usually a cornerstone. By lying, even with good intentions, the author could be setting a precedent for dishonesty. If the boyfriend later finds out the truth, it might damage their trust in each other. Additionally, the author might be justifying the lie by the outcome, but that doesn't necessarily make it right.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is technically in the wrong for lying. Even if her intentions were good, the act of lying is still a betrayal of trust. The right thing would have been to tell the truth, even if it was uncomfortable, or to let the boyfriend come to his own conclusions without fabricating information.\n"
