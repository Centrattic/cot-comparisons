For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. The situation is complicated, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author started dating her boyfriend after he broke up with his ex. The breakup was because the ex might have cheated, and the author heard rumors. She wasn't close to the ex, but when the boyfriend asked if she saw the ex at a party, she lied and said she saw her with other guys. This made him feel better and move on faster. Now she's questioning if she did the right thing.\n\nSo, the main issue here is lying. The author created a false narrative to help her boyfriend feel better. But is that acceptable? Well, deception is generally considered wrong because it violates trust. Even if the intent was good, the action itself is a lie. The boyfriend might not have had closure otherwise, but the author's lie might prevent him from dealing with the real reasons the relationship ended. What if the ex didn't actually cheat? The author is making up a reason for the breakup, which could affect the boyfriend's perception of his past relationship and maybe his future ones too. Also, if the truth ever comes out, it could damage his trust in the author. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to help him move on. She felt he was still upset and wanted him to have closure. But is it her place to fabricate such information? Relationships require honesty, and lying, even for good reasons, can lead to bigger issues. The boyfriend might have needed to process the breakup on his own, and the author stepping in to create a reason might not be healthy in the long run. \n\nSo, considering all this, the act of lying is a violation of trust and honesty, which are fundamental in a relationship. Even with good intentions, the author's actions are ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
