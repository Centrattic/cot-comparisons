For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for lying to their boyfriend about his ex cheating. The situation is that the girlfriend saw the ex at a party but didn't actually see her cheating. When the boyfriend asked, the girlfriend lied and said she saw the ex with other guys, which made him feel better and move on faster.\n\nFirst, the main ethical issue here is lying. The author intentionally misled her boyfriend, which is a form of deceit. Even though her intention was to help him feel better, the act of lying is still a problem. Relationships are built on trust, and lying, even with good intentions, can erode that trust. The author also continued to keep up the lie, which adds to the problem because it's not a one-time thing but an ongoing deception.\n\nAnother angle is the harm caused. The author's lie might prevent the boyfriend from fully processing his breakup in an honest way. If the ex didn't actually cheat, then the reason for the breakup might have been different, and the boyfriend might not have closure. But in this case, the author's lie seems to have helped him move on, but at the cost of truth. However, the boyfriend might not be dealing with the real reasons for the breakup, which could come back to affect their current relationship if discovered.\n\nThe author's motivation is also a factor. She wanted her new relationship to thrive and saw her lie as a way to help him. But manipulating the truth, even for a good reason, is still manipulation. People might argue that the end justifies the means here, but generally, honesty is valued in relationships. The potential consequences of being caught in a lie could be severe, leading to a loss of trust or even the end of the current relationship.\n\nMoreover, the author hasn't told the truth, which means the boyfriend is operating under false information. If the ex was actually innocent, the author is contributing to a false narrative that could hurt the ex. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the ex. Still, the act of lying is a clear breach of trust in their relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions were to help her boyfriend, the act of lying and maintaining the lie is ethically wrong. Trust is fundamental in relationships, and the lie could have long-term negative effects. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
