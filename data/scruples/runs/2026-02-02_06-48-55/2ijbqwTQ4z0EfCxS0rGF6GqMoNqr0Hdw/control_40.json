For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. I need to figure out if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and her boyfriend started dating four months ago. He was previously in a two-year relationship with a girl from the same sorority. They broke up because he suspected she cheated, based on rumors from a party. The author was at the party but doesn't remember seeing the ex. When he asked if she saw the ex with others, she lied and said she did. Now he's happier and moved on, but the author is conflicted about her lie.\n\nSo, the key points here are deception, intent, and consequences. The author lied to help her boyfriend move on from his ex. But is that okay?\n\nEthically, lying is generally considered wrong because it violates trust. Even if the intention was good\u2014to help him feel better\u2014it's still a lie. The boyfriend might have made decisions based on that lie, like accepting the breakup as justified. If he found out later, it could damage their relationship. Also, the author is keeping the lie going, which means she's not being honest with him now.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author felt his happiness was important. But relationships require honesty. Even if the lie had a positive short-term effect, the act of lying is problematic. The author might be justifying it as a \"white lie,\" but in a romantic context, honesty is crucial for trust.\n\nAnother angle: the author had a crush on him for a while and wanted a new start. Maybe she felt desperate to help him move on. But that doesn't excuse the lie. People should be honest even if they're trying to help.\n\nConsequences: The lie helped him move on faster, but if he finds out, it could lead to betrayal. The author is now keeping up the lie, which means she's maintaining a deceitful relationship. That's a red flag. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong. The lie, regardless of intent, is harmful in a relationship. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
