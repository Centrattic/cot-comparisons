For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about lying to their boyfriend about his ex cheating. The author is the girl who made up a story that his ex was cheating at a party, which led him to move on faster. Now they're questioning if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Lying to someone, especially in a relationship, is generally seen as wrong. The author lied to her boyfriend, which could be considered manipulative. Her intent was to help him move on from his ex, but the means were dishonest. Honesty is a key component in trust between partners. By lying, she might have caused him to believe something that isn't true, which could have real consequences if he ever found out the truth. \n\nBut then again, her motivation was to help him feel better. She might not have intended to harm him. However, the principle of lying is still there. Even if the intention is good, the act of deception is still a lie. Also, the boyfriend's decision to move on might be based on false information. If he later found out the truth, it could damage their current relationship. \n\nAnother angle: the author didn't directly confirm the cheating, just said she saw the ex with other guys. That's not necessarily confirmation of cheating but might have pushed him to believe it. So maybe the lie was subtle but still impactful. \n\nThe author might argue that the lie was harmless now since the boyfriend is happy. But the moral dilemma here is whether the end justifies the means. Even if the outcome is positive, the action itself was unethical. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. Lying, even with good intentions, can erode that trust. The author's lie could be seen as a betrayal of trust, even if it was meant to help. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend already suspected the ex cheated. The author's lie might have just given him confirmation. But the fact remains that the author made up information. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the consensus is likely that the author is in the wrong because she lied, even if her intentions were to help. The answer should be A.\n"
