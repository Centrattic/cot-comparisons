For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an asshole for lying to their boyfriend about his ex cheating. They started dating four months ago, and the boyfriend was still dealing with the breakup from his ex. The author saw the ex at a party he thinks she cheated at but didn't see her interact with anyone. When he asked, the author lied and said they saw her with other guys, making him believe she cheated. Now, he's happier and moved on, but the author is regretting the lie.\n\nSo, the key points here are intent and consequences. The author's intention was to help her boyfriend move on by confirming his suspicions. However, lying is generally considered wrong because it's deceptive. Even if the lie was to help, it's still a lie. The author is keeping the lie going, not correcting him even when they know he's happy with the false information.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is whether the lie was justified. The lie caused the boyfriend to move on but might have done so based on false premises. The author is avoiding the truth, which could lead to bigger issues if found out. Trust is crucial in a relationship, and lying about such a personal issue can damage that trust if discovered. Even if the intention was good, the act of lying is still wrong.\n\nPeople often say that lying is wrong regardless of the reason. While the author's motive was to help her partner feel better, the lie is still a betrayal of trust. The boyfriend might feel hurt if he ever finds out, even if he's happy now. The author is keeping the lie alive, which means she's actively maintaining deception. That's a problem because honesty is a foundation in relationships. So, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
