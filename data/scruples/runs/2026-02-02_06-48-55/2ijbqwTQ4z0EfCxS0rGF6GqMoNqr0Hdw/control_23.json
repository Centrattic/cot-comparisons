For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who lied to their boyfriend about his ex cheating is in the wrong. The situation is that the author started dating her boyfriend after he broke up with his ex. The ex's breakup was because he suspected cheating at a party. The author, who was at the party but didn't see the ex with others, lied when he asked if she had seen any signs of cheating. Now he's moved on, and the author is feeling guilty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects. Lying is generally considered wrong, especially if it harms someone or manipulates their feelings. The author's intent was to help her boyfriend move on by confirming his suspicion that the ex cheated. But by lying, she's essentially confirming a suspicion that might not be true. This could be seen as enabling his narrative without truth, which might prevent him from dealing with the real reasons for the breakup.\n\nAlso, relationships built on honesty require trust. By lying, the author is compromising that trust. Even if the intention was good, the act of deception is still there. The boyfriend might not have needed confirmation of cheating to move on; maybe he needed time or another reason. The lie could also backfire if the ex's actual reasons for breaking up were different, leading to potential issues later if discovered.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the author's own conscience. She's feeling guilty, which suggests she knows it's wrong. The fact that she's asking for advice indicates she's conflicted. The community usually frowns upon actions that manipulate others, even with good intentions. So, even if the outcome was positive (he's happier), the means were unethical.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that helping someone move on from a past relationship is compassionate. But the key here is the method. The lie was a direct manipulation of facts. If the author had been honest, maybe the boyfriend could have processed the breakup differently. The lie might prevent him from addressing any unresolved issues with his ex, like communication problems or personal insecurities.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong (A) because she lied to manipulate her boyfriend's perception, which is a breach of trust and honesty in their relationship. The good intentions don't excuse the act of deception.\n"
