For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. The situation involves the boyfriend still being upset after a breakup, and the author lied to help him move on.\n\nFirst, the ethical angle: lying is generally considered wrong because it breaches trust. Even if the intention was good, the lie could have serious consequences. The boyfriend believed his ex cheated because of the lie, which might affect his trust in future relationships or his self-perception of the breakup.\n\nSecond, the context: the couple had only been dating four months. The author had a crush on him for a while but they started dating after the breakup. The lie was told to help him move on. However, keeping the lie up might mean he's not dealing with the real reasons for the breakup, which could be important for his emotional healing.\n\nAlso, the author mentions there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now, implying she's stuck with the lie. But the boyfriend's happiness is based on a falsehood. If he found out, it could damage their relationship. Even if he's happier, the lie could backfire later.\n\nIn relationships, honesty is crucial. The author's intention was to help, but the method was deceitful. There's a difference between being kind and being truthful. The lie might have provided temporary relief but could lead to long-term issues. So, the author is in the wrong because she used deception, which can erode trust, even if the motive was well-meaning.\n"
