For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down. The situation is that the author is in a new relationship with her boyfriend, who had a previous girlfriend who broke up with him. The ex's breakup was because he suspected she cheated, based on rumors. The author was at the party in question but didn't actually see the ex cheating. When the boyfriend asked if she saw the ex there, she lied and said she saw her with other guys. This made the boyfriend feel better about the breakup, moving on faster, and now he's happier. The author is conflicted because there's no upside in telling the truth now, but she's worried about lying.\n\nFirst, the key points here are deception and intent. The author lied to her boyfriend to make him feel better, which had the effect of helping him move on. But lying, even with good intentions, can have ethical implications. The question is whether the lie is justified.\n\nIn ethics, there's a debate about lying for a good cause. Some might argue that if the lie prevents harm and promotes well-being, it's acceptable. However, others would say that lying is inherently wrong because it breaches trust. In a relationship, honesty is crucial. Even if the lie was meant to help, the author's action could backfire if the truth ever comes out. For example, if the ex didn't actually cheat, the boyfriend might feel even more betrayed when he finds out he was lied about. This could damage the current relationship.\n\nAlso, considering the author's motivation: she wanted to see her boyfriend happy and to move past the ex. While that's understandable, using a lie to achieve that is problematic. The boyfriend's trust is a foundational element in their relationship. By lying, the author has set a precedent where she might feel justified in lying again in the future, which can erode trust over time.\n\nAnother angle is the potential harm. The author didn't gain anything from the lie; she only wanted to help her boyfriend. However, the harm is on the boyfriend's side. He might have been happier believing the lie, but the truth could be more damaging if revealed. Even if it hasn't come up yet, the lie exists as a potential point of conflict. Relationships require transparency, and this lie, even if well-intentioned, is a breach of that.\n\nThe author might think there's no harm since the boyfriend is happier, but the ethical issue is about the action itself, not just the outcome. In many ethical frameworks, lying is considered wrong regardless of the consequences. So even if the result was positive, the act of lying is still a moral transgression.\n\nAdditionally, the author's role in the situation: she was present at the party but didn't see the ex cheating. Her uncertainty (rumors, not actual evidence) makes her position even more questionable. She didn't have concrete evidence to support the lie, which adds another layer of wrongdoing. It's not just lying; it's creating a false narrative based on incomplete information.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions were to help her boyfriend, the act of lying is a breach of trust and honesty, which are essential in any relationship. The potential long-term harm of the lie, even if not immediately visible, makes the author ethically in the wrong."
