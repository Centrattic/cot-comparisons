For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. The situation is that she saw the ex at a party but didn't actually see her cheating. She lied to confirm his suspicions, which helped him move on. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Lying is generally considered wrong because it can harm others and break trust. In a relationship, honesty is crucial. Even if the intention was to help him feel better, the lie could have long-term consequences.\n\nThe author's motivation was to help her boyfriend move on, but she might have known that the ex's cheating wasn't confirmed. By lying, she's manipulating his perception. If the ex didn't actually cheat, then the author is creating a false narrative. This could affect his self-esteem or how he approaches future relationships if he's convinced he made the right decision based on false information.\n\nAlso, the author is currently the girlfriend, so her actions could impact their current relationship. If the truth ever comes out, her boyfriend might feel betrayed. Even if there's no immediate harm, the lie is still there, and she's keeping it up, which means she's aware of the deception ongoing.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the ex did cheat, and the author just didn't see it. But the user states that the ex's cheating wasn't confirmed, just rumors. The author had no proof but chose to lie. That's the key point here. Without evidence, the lie is harmful.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, lying without a good reason (like self-defense or protection from serious harm) is typically wrong. The author's action, while well-intentioned, is a deliberate deception. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014she's in the wrong.\n"
