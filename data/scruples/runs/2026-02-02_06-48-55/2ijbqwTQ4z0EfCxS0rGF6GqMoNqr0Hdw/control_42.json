For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is the asshole for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. The situation is that the boyfriend was still upset after his breakup because he thought his ex might have cheated. The author, wanting him to move on, lied about seeing the ex with other guys at a party. Now he's happier and more sure about the breakup because of the lie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Lying is generally considered wrong because it can hurt others and damage trust. The author's intention was to help her boyfriend move on, but the means were deceitful. Even if the motive was good, the lie could have long-term consequences. She's keeping up the lie now, which might mean more lies in the future to maintain the story. That could lead to a breakdown in trust between her and her boyfriend once the truth comes out. \n\nAlso, the author might be justifying the lie by saying there's nothing to gain from telling the truth now, but this approach is problematic. It's possible that her boyfriend's healing process is based on false information, which might not be sustainable. If the truth came out later, it could cause more pain and betrayal. \n\nThe author's actions were driven by her own emotional needs (wanting him to move on) rather than his actual needs. He had a right to know the truth about his past relationship, even if it was painful. By lying, she made decisions about his emotional well-being without his consent. \n\nOn the other hand, people do sometimes lie to protect others' feelings, but this is usually in smaller, less consequential situations. The stakes here are higher, involving a significant relationship history. The line between helping and manipulating is crossed here because the lie directly affects his perception of his past and current trust in the author.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is in the wrong. The lie, despite good intentions, is unethical because it involves deception that could harm both relationships. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
