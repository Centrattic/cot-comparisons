For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is dating their boyfriend, who was previously with another girl from the same sorority. They broke up because he suspected cheating, and the author, who had a crush on him, lied about seeing the ex with other guys at a party. The lie made the boyfriend move on faster, and he's now happier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Lying is generally wrong because it's deceptive. The author intentionally misled their partner about a significant event that affected his feelings towards his ex. Even if the intention was to help him heal, the act of lying still undermines trust in the relationship. Trust is crucial in any relationship, and once it's broken, it can be hard to rebuild.\n\nThe author might argue that the lie had a positive outcome: the boyfriend is happier and has moved on. But the ends don't always justify the means. Even if the outcome is good, the lie itself is a moral issue. The boyfriend has a right to know the truth about his past relationship. If he found out later, it could cause more harm and betrayal, which might damage their current relationship.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation was to make the boyfriend feel better. However, using deception to achieve that is problematic. The boyfriend might not have been ready to move on, but the truth could have led to a more genuine healing process. The lie might have prevented him from addressing any unresolved issues with his ex, which could come up later in his relationship with the author.\n\nAnother angle is the potential long-term consequences. If the lie is discovered, the boyfriend might feel betrayed, leading to a crisis of trust. The author might have to deal with guilt and the fallout of their decision. Relationships built on honesty are more stable, so this lie could create instability in the future.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intention was to help, the act of lying is ethically wrong. The truth is important in a relationship, and the potential consequences of being found out could harm the relationship more than the initial lie intended to prevent. So the answer is A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
