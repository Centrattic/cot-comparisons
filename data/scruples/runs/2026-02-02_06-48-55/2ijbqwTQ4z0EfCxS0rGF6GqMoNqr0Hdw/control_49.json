For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break it down. The author is a college senior who's been dating her boyfriend for four months. His ex broke up with him because he thought she cheated, based on rumors from a party. The author was at the party but doesn't remember seeing the ex. When the boyfriend asked if she saw the ex with others, she lied and said she did. Now he's moved on faster because he's convinced the ex cheated, and the author is conflicted because he's happier now but she's lying.\n\nFirst, the main issue is lying. The author intentionally misled her boyfriend to help him feel better. Lying to someone, especially in a relationship, is a big deal. Even if the intention was good, the lie could have consequences. For example, if the ex actually didn't cheat, the boyfriend is being deceived, which could affect his future decisions or trust in relationships. Also, the author is maintaining the lie, which is another problem because it's not just a one-time white lie; she's keeping it up now.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's motivation was to help her boyfriend move on from a past relationship. She felt that he was still upset and wanted to give him closure. But does that justify lying? Even if the intention was to help, deception isn't usually considered acceptable because it undermines trust. Trust is fundamental in any relationship, and once it's broken, it's hard to rebuild. The author might be avoiding a confrontation or an uncomfortable truth, which is common in cases of lying by omission or commission.\n\nAnother angle: the author might not have known the full story. She wasn't close to the ex and the party was big. She didn't see her, but she fabricated a story. Even if the ex did do something, the author isn't in a position to confirm. So the lie is based on incomplete information, which is risky. If the truth came out later, the boyfriend could feel betrayed, which could harm their current relationship.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The act of lying, regardless of the reason, is typically seen as wrong. The consequences here are that the boyfriend is happier, but that's a short-term gain. The long-term effects could be damaging if the lie is discovered, or if it affects his ability to trust in the future. Also, the author's mental state is \"eating her up inside,\" indicating guilt, which suggests she knows it's wrong.\n\nIn terms of ethics, utilitarianism would look at the consequences. If the lie made her boyfriend happier and there's no harm, maybe it's justified. But deontological ethics would say that lying is inherently wrong regardless of the outcome. Most people value honesty in relationships, so even if the intention was good, the action of lying is problematic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). The lie, even with good intentions, is a betrayal of trust and could have negative repercussions. The author should have been honest, even if it meant her boyfriend was upset in the short term.\n"
