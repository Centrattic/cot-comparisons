For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. So, she's the one who made up a story that his ex was with other guys at a party, leading him to believe she cheated. The boyfriend was still hurting from the breakup, and the author lied to help him move on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Lying is generally seen as wrong because it breaches trust. Even if the intention was good\u2014to help him feel better\u2014it's a lie. Trust is a cornerstone in relationships, so if this comes out later, there could be serious consequences. The author might have thought she was helping, but she manipulated the situation to make him feel better, which is problematic.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that there's no benefit in telling the truth now. But maybe she should have told him the truth from the start. Even if it was hard, honesty is usually the best policy. By lying, she's preventing him from getting the real facts, which could affect their relationship in the long run. What if the ex didn't actually cheat? That's a big assumption to make and feed to someone else.\n\nOn the other hand, she had good intentions. She wanted him to move on and be happy. But intentions don't excuse the action. The lie could cause issues if discovered. Maybe he would have felt different if he knew the truth\u2014that his ex might not have cheated. The author is keeping a secret that could impact both of their relationships.\n\nAnother angle: the author is in a position where she's using information she had (being at the party) but didn't actually see the ex with other guys. She's creating a narrative based on rumors and her own observations. That's not just lying; it's fabrication. Even if she thought it was for the best, it's still a harmful act.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. The lie, regardless of the intention, is a betrayal of trust and could have long-term negative effects. The answer is A.\n"
