For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is a college senior in a new relationship with her boyfriend. They started dating four months ago. The boyfriend had a previous relationship that ended because he suspected his ex cheated. The author overheard rumors about the ex cheating at a party, but she wasn't close to the ex. When the boyfriend asked if she saw the ex at the party, she lied and said she saw her with other guys. This made the boyfriend feel better and move on faster. Now, the author is conflicted because the boyfriend is happier, but she's lying about it. She's asking if she's the asshole for lying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Lying is generally considered wrong, but there might be nuances. The author's intention was to help her boyfriend move on from his past relationship. However, lying to someone, even with good intentions, can have consequences. The boyfriend is now convinced his ex cheated based on the author's lie. If the ex didn't actually cheat, the boyfriend's perception is being manipulated. This could affect his ability to trust the author in the future. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that she was trying to help him heal. The boyfriend was still upset about the breakup, and the lie seemed to help him move on. But lying to someone can erode trust in a relationship. If the boyfriend ever finds out the truth, he might feel betrayed, which could damage their current relationship. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author had any right to lie. The boyfriend had a right to know the truth about his ex, even if it was painful. By fabricating a story, the author is essentially deciding what truth he should know, which is a form of manipulation. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned that there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now, implying that the boyfriend is happier. However, happiness built on a lie is not sustainable. While the immediate effect is positive, the long-term consequences could be detrimental. \n\nIn relationships, honesty is usually considered a cornerstone. Without trust, relationships can face serious issues. The author might have thought she was doing the right thing, but the act of lying is a violation of trust. \n\nSo, even if her intentions were good, the action of lying is ethically questionable. The author is in the wrong because she manipulated her boyfriend's perception of his past, which could lead to future problems in their relationship. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
