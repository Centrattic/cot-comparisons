For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. Alright, let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author started dating the guy four months ago, after he broke up with his ex. The ex left because he suspected cheating due to rumors. The author was at a party where the rumors started but didn't actually see the ex with anyone. When he asked if she saw them, she lied and said she did, which helped him move on. Now, she's wondering if she's the asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the lie, the intent behind it, and the consequences. The author's intention was to help her boyfriend feel better and move on. But lying is still lying. The problem is that she's withholding the truth, which could affect their relationship's trust. Even if it helped him in the short term, keeping up the lie might come back to haunt them. Also, the ex didn't actually cheat according to the author's knowledge, so the lie is a fabrication.\n\nNow, some might argue that her intent was good, but deception is usually a bad idea. Relationships require honesty, and even if the outcome seems positive now, if the truth comes out later, it could cause more harm. She's also not in a position to confirm the cheating; she was there but didn't see it. So creating a story based on rumors isn't justifiable.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say she was trying to help him heal. But the means don't justify the ends here. The lie could have long-term consequences if discovered. So overall, the author is in the wrong because she lied, even with good intentions. The answer should be A.\n"
