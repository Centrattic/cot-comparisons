For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author lied to her boyfriend about his ex cheating, even though she didn't actually see it. The boyfriend was still upset about the breakup, and the author thought lying would help him move on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Lying is generally considered wrong because it's a form of deception. But maybe there's a context where it's a \"white lie\" to protect someone's feelings. However, in this case, the lie was about a serious matter\u2014cheating, which can have long-term effects on someone's trust and relationships.\n\nThe author knew the truth from the start because she was at the party. She didn't see any evidence, but she told her boyfriend that she did. Now, the boyfriend is happy and has moved on. But the author is conflicted because she's keeping up the lie. The key here is whether the lie was justified. \n\nThe author's intention was to help her boyfriend heal. However, the problem is that the information she provided was false. Even if it helped him, lying about someone cheating is a significant breach of trust. Cheating is a serious issue, and if the ex wasn't actually cheating, the author's lie could be seen as manipulating the situation to make her boyfriend feel better. \n\nAlso, the author is now in a relationship with him, and maintaining this lie could affect their trust if he ever finds out. Even if there's no immediate harm now, the lie could come back and damage their relationship. \n\nAnother angle: the author might be justifying her actions by thinking there's nothing to gain from the truth, but the boyfriend's happiness isn't a valid justification if it's based on a lie. People have a right to know the truth about their past, even if it's painful. The author's actions might prevent him from fully healing if the real reasons for the breakup were different. \n\nIn ethical terms, honesty is typically valued. While the intention was good, the method was dishonest. The author might be the asshole because she used deceit to manage his emotions, which could be seen as manipulative. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). Even if the lie helped him move on, the act of lying is a breach of trust and morality in this context.\n"
