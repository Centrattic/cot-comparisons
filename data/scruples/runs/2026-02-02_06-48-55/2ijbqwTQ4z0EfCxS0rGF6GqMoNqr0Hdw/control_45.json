For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to their boyfriend about his ex cheating. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the answer should be A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author started dating their boyfriend after he broke up with his ex. The breakup happened because he suspected the ex cheated at a party. The author, who was at the party but didn't see the ex with others, lied to the boyfriend about seeing her with other guys. The lie helped the boyfriend move on faster and feel better about the breakup. The author is now conflicted because the boyfriend is happier and there's no benefit to telling the truth now.\n\nSo, is lying justified here? The key points are deception, intent, and consequences. The author's intent was to help the boyfriend move on, but lying is inherently deceitful. Relationships require honesty and trust. Even if the lie had the intent of helping, it's a betrayal of trust. The author might have felt empathy, but the act of lying is wrong regardless of the motive. The consequences are that the boyfriend is happier, but he was misled. Even if the truth doesn't change the past, the lie affects the current relationship's foundation. The boyfriend might have made decisions based on false information. So, the author is in the wrong because they intentionally misled their partner, which violates trust. The answer should be A.\n"
