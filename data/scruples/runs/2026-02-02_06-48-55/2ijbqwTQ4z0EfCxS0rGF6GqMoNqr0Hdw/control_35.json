For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author started dating the guy after he broke up with his ex. They were in the same college, and there was a party where the ex was rumored to have cheated. The author wasn't close to the ex but was at the party. When the boyfriend asked if she saw the ex with other guys, she lied and confirmed the rumors, which helped him move on. Now she's wondering if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Lying to another person, even if with good intentions, can have consequences. The boyfriend is relying on her honesty in their relationship. By lying, she manipulated his understanding of the situation, which could affect his healing process. If the ex didn't actually cheat, the boyfriend might be wrongfully believing he was justified in the breakup, which could impact his ability to trust in the future. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that she had a crush on him for a while, so maybe she wanted to help him move on to be with him. But that doesn't justify lying. Relationships require trust, and lying, even if it's meant to help, can erode that trust. Plus, if the ex was innocent, the author is contributing to a false narrative that could harm someone else's reputation unfairly.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that her intentions were good\u2014she wanted him to heal and move on. But intentions don't always absolve the action. The lie could come back to haunt them if the truth ever surfaces. The boyfriend might later discover the lie, which could lead to bigger issues in their relationship. \n\nAlso, the author is the one who's now feeling guilty, which suggests that she knows deep down it was wrong. The fact that she's asking for feedback indicates she's conflicted. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, lying is generally considered wrong because it's a breach of honesty. Even if the outcome is positive, the act itself is ethically questionable. The author's lie was based on incomplete information (she didn't see the ex at the party) and her own assumptions and desires. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because she lied to manipulate the situation for her own benefit and her boyfriend's perceived emotional well-being, which is a form of deception.\n"
