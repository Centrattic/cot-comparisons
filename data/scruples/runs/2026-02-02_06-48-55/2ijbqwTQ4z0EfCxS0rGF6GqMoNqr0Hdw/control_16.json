For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author started dating her boyfriend after he broke up with his ex. He was still upset about the breakup because he thought she cheated at a party. The author, who was at the party, didn't see his ex with anyone but lied to him, saying she saw her with other guys. This made him feel better and move on faster.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Lying is generally considered wrong because it breaches trust. Even if the intent was to help him feel better, the lie was significant. The boyfriend's perception of the breakup is based on false information. The author is maintaining the lie, knowing there's no benefit to telling the truth now. \n\nBut there's also the context that the author had a crush on him for a while and wanted him to move on. However, manipulating someone's emotions through deception, even with good intentions, can have consequences. Trust is foundational in a relationship, and lying about such a personal matter might harm their relationship in the long run, even if it seems beneficial now.\n\nAlso, the author admits she feels guilty. That guilt suggests she recognizes that the lie is morally wrong. The fact that she's seeking advice indicates she's conflicted. The community often values honesty in relationships, so even if the outcome is positive, the act of lying is still ethically questionable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because she intentionally lied to her partner about a significant issue, which is a breach of trust regardless of the intention. The answer should be A.\n"
