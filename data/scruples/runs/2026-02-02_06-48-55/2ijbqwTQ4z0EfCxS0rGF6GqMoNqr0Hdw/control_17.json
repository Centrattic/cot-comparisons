For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for lying to her boyfriend about his ex cheating. So I need to analyze the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and her boyfriend are both in college, seniors. They started dating four months ago. The boyfriend was with his ex for two years, and they broke up because he suspected she cheated. The author was at a party where the ex was supposedly cheating but didn't actually see her. When the boyfriend asked if she saw the ex, she lied and said she saw her with other guys. This made him move on faster, and now he's happier. The author is conflicted because she knows she lied but thinks there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author didn't have evidence of the ex cheating, lied when asked, and the lie helped her boyfriend move on. But is that her responsibility to do?\n\nEthically, lying is generally considered wrong because it breaches trust. Even if the intention was good (to help him move on), the act of lying is deceptive. The author's motivation was to make the boyfriend feel better, but she didn't have facts to back up her statement. She might be justifying it by saying there's no harm since he's happier, but the lie could have long-term consequences if discovered. Also, relationships require honesty, so this lie could erode trust if she continues to keep it up or if the truth comes out later.\n\nAdditionally, the author might have a personal interest in wanting the boyfriend to move on, possibly to secure her own position in the relationship. However, manipulating someone's perception through lies isn't a healthy approach. The boyfriend has a right to know the truth, especially if it's about his past relationship. Even if the author didn't see his ex, she shouldn't fabricate details that influence his decisions and emotions.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author didn't realize the weight of her words. She might have thought she was helping him, not intending any malice. But the intent doesn't necessarily excuse the action. The consequences of the lie might be positive for now, but the act itself is still a violation of honesty in the relationship. If the boyfriend found out later that the ex wasn't actually cheating, it could cause more pain and mistrust than if he had kept doubting the breakup.\n\nIn summary, while the author's intentions might have been to help her boyfriend, the lie is still a breach of trust. Relationships built on honesty are more sustainable, and the author's actions could lead to future issues. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
