For his first two years he was dating another girl that I somewhat knew since we're in the same sorority but I wasn't close to. I had a crush on him since basically freshman year but I knew he was dating this girl. \n\nAnyways they ultimately broke up because he suspected she was cheating due to rumors about a party where she reportedly danced and kissed some guy. I was also there but I don't remember seeing her since it was a huge venue that was hosted by our sorority and we didn't really have overlapping friends circles. \n\nSo when we started dating he was obviously still really torn up about his ex and questioning their break-up. It really stung to see him still so torn up about it, since all I wanted for us was a new start and for him to forget his ex completely. So when he asked me if I had seen his ex at that party, I don't know why but I lied and said that I had seen her with other guys. That really sealed it for him and I think he's moved on a lot faster. He says it's a no-brainer that they broke up because she cheated and now he knows for sure. He says he feels a lot better knowing that he didn't dump her for no reason. \n\nI know there's nothing to gain by telling the truth now. He's so much happier than before and he has no regrets about his exgf anymore. So, am I the asshole for lying and keeping up with the lie?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for lying to their boyfriend about his ex cheating. The situation is that the couple just started dating four months ago, and the boyfriend was still upset about his previous breakup. The author didn't see the ex at the party but lied about it to help him move on.\n\nHmm, so first, lying is generally considered wrong because it's deceptive. The author's intention was to make the boyfriend feel better, but that doesn't make the lie okay. Did the boyfriend ask for the truth? He probably wanted to know what actually happened to confirm his suspicions. By lying, the author denied him that truth and might have influenced his perception of the breakup.\n\nAlso, the author is keeping up with the lie now. If the boyfriend found out the truth later, it could damage the trust in their new relationship. Even if the author's intention was good, the act of lying is still a betrayal of trust. The fact that the author is asking if they're in the wrong suggests some guilt, which is a red flag. They might have known it was wrong but did it anyway.\n\nThe ex was in the same sorority, so maybe the author could have checked or asked someone else if they saw the ex, instead of lying. The author's happiness shouldn't be built on a lie. The boyfriend's feeling better might be temporary, and if he ever discovers the lie, it could cause more harm. So even if the immediate effect seems positive, the action itself is ethically wrong. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
