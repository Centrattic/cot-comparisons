He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discussing free bleeding with her boyfriend and roommate. Free bleeding is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets their blood flow freely, which can involve not cleaning up or using any absorbent products. \n\nThe author mentions that she's been doing this for six months without staining anything except her underwear. Her boyfriend is upset about it, saying she's gross and that she's being a \"basic white girl feminist.\" He's also concerned about potential stains and seems to be emotionally reactive, even going so far as the author crying in the spare room while he feels justified.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to check. So, I need to consider both sides. \n\nFirst, the author's perspective: she's making a personal choice about her body. Free bleeding is a valid choice for some people, often related to body autonomy, cost of products, or environmental concerns. She's not caused any issues beyond her underwear, so her actions aren't directly affecting others except possibly if she does stain something. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his discomfort or fear of potential messes, but if she's managed it for six months without issues, maybe his concerns are unfounded. His accusations of her being a \"basic white girl feminist\" also suggest he's dismissing her choices as performative or not serious, which could be disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, her boyfriend is living with her, so there's a shared living space. If her free bleeding leads to possible stains on common areas, that's a legitimate concern. However, she's stated she hasn't stained anything else. His reaction seems more about his own feelings rather than actual harm. Also, his use of a derogatory term (\"basic white girl feminist\") is clearly disrespectful and invalidating. \n\nThe key points here are body autonomy versus shared living responsibilities. The author is making a choice about her own body, which is her right. However, in a shared living space, there might be some responsibilities to consider others' comfort. But if she's not actually causing issues, his reaction is more about his personal discomfort. The boyfriend's behavior seems more problematic: he's making her feel bad about her choices, calling her names, and not being supportive. The author getting upset because of his dismissive and insulting remarks is a valid emotional reaction.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong for choosing to free bleed. Her boyfriend is overreacting and being disrespectful. The fact that he's invalidating her choices and making her feel bad is the real issue here. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
