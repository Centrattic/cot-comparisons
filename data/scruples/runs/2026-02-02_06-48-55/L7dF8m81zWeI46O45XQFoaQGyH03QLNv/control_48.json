He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding versus using tampons or pads.\n\nSo, the author mentions that they free bleed, which is a choice some women make for various reasons like cost, comfort, or environmental concerns. The boyfriend is upset about it, saying it's gross and that he's worried about blood getting on things. The author is getting mad at him for this reaction. The roommate is mentioned as being part of the conversation too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is making a personal choice about their menstrual health, which is their body and their decision. However, the boyfriend is concerned about the potential mess and the impact on their shared living space. The author argues that they haven't actually stained anything beyond their underwear, but the boyfriend is still upset. The author is also emotional, crying in the spare room, and the boyfriend is feeling justified.\n\nFrom a feminist perspective, free bleeding is a valid choice, and the author's decision not to spend money on products is a personal financial choice. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from cultural or personal biases about menstruation, seeing it as something gross or needing to be hidden. His comment about \"basic white girl feminist\" could be dismissive of her valid choices and maybe a bit of a stereotype.\n\nBut I also need to think about shared living spaces. If one person's habits affect another, there can be valid concerns. However, the author hasn't actually caused a mess, just the potential. The boyfriend's anxiety about it might be overblown. The fact that the author is upset and the boyfriend isn't showing empathy is a red flag. The use of insults and the situation escalating to making her cry suggests he's not handling it well.\n\nSo, the key points are: The author has the right to make her own health decisions. The boyfriend is projecting his discomfort onto her choice, calling her gross, which is dismissive. He's also not considering her reasons or validating her experience. The author's reaction is a response to being insulted, not just a personal choice. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground. The boyfriend's concern about the living space isn't entirely baseless. But the way he's handling it is toxic. The author isn't wrong for being upset when he's attacking her valid choice and making her feel bad. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the boyfriend's behavior is more problematic. The author is not in the wrong for making a personal choice and being upset when it's criticized. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
