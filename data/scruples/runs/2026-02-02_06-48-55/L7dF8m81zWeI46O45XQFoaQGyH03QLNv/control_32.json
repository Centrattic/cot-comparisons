He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for free bleeding and getting upset about her boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice. Some people choose not to use menstrual products for various reasons, including cost, environmental concerns, or personal preference. The author mentions not wanting to spend money on tampons, which is a valid reason. So, from a personal autonomy standpoint, she's not in the wrong for making that choice.\n\nNext, the boyfriend is upset about the possibility of stains, even though there haven't been any except on her underwear. His reaction seems to be about potential mess rather than actual issues. The author is getting emotional and feels insulted by his comments. The boyfriend's criticism of her as \"gross\" and implying she's not an adult seems judgmental and dismissive of her choice. That's a problem because respecting personal choices, even if you disagree, is important in a relationship.\n\nHe also called her a \"basic white girl feminist\" which sounds like a derogatory label. That's clearly not okay. Using such a term is disrespectful and could be a way to dismiss her valid concerns or beliefs. It's an example of gaslighting or invalidating her feelings.\n\nThe author is upset because he's overreacting to a situation where there hasn't been a real problem. His fear of potential stains isn't justified since there's no history of actual incidents. His reaction is causing emotional distress, and that's not acceptable. The fact that she's crying and retreating to the spare room shows the impact of his words.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have some role. The author has the right to make her own health decisions, and the boyfriend should respect that. However, the author could also consider how her choice affects the shared living space, but since there's no actual problem, that's not the main issue here. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his personal discomfort and judgment rather than a legitimate concern.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. He's being disrespectful and not supporting his partner's choice. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset by his reaction. Her choice to free bleed is her right, and his derogatory comments and lack of support are the real problems. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
