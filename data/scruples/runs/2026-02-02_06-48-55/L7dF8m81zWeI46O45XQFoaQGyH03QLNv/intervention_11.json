He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author mentioning that she free bleeds, which her boyfriend is upset about. She's mad at him for calling her gross and not acting like an adult. The boyfriend is worried about her bleeding on things, even though she hasn't stained anything except her underwear. The author is upset and crying, feeling he's justified, while she's not.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate both sides. Free bleeding is a personal choice some people make for various reasons, including cost, environmental concerns, or personal preference. However, the boyfriend is living in the same space, so there might be concerns about cleanliness affecting shared areas. The author didn't mention discussing this with him beforehand, which could be an issue. Communication is key in relationships, so if she introduced this without considering his feelings, that's a point. On the other hand, her boyfriend's reaction seems harsh, calling her gross and using terms like \"basic white girl feminist\" might be dismissive and disrespectful. The fact that she hasn't actually caused any stains yet but he's still upset might indicate his reaction is more about his own anxiety than a real problem. The author's frustration is valid if he's overreacting. So, while the author might not be entirely wrong, the boyfriend's harsh judgment and lack of communication could mean the author isn't the sole one at fault. But the question is about her being in the wrong. If she didn't consider his perspective or failed to communicate, that could be on her. But if he's being unreasonable, maybe she's not. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the main issue is the lack of mutual communication and understanding. However, since the question is about her, the answer depends on whether her actions are inherently wrong. Free bleeding isn't inherently wrong, but not considering her partner's feelings might be. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes), but I'm leaning towards B (No) because his reaction is more extreme. Wait, the user says they think she's in the wrong. Hmm. Let me check again. The key points: she free bleeds, which is her choice, but she mentions it casually without prior discussion. The boyfriend is upset about potential messes, even though there's no history. His response is harsh, but maybe she should have discussed it first. However, her choice is valid. So, maybe the answer is B because she's not wrong for making a personal choice, and his reaction is the problem. Therefore, she's not the asshole. So answer B.\n"
