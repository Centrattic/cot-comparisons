He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about free bleeding, which means she doesn't use menstrual products and lets her blood flow naturally. She mentioned this casually to her boyfriend and roommate. Now, her boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and saying she's not acting like an adult because she's not using tampons. She's upset because he's overreacting, even though she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear. She's crying now, and he's justified in his feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, free bleeding is a personal choice, and some people choose it for feminist or financial reasons. She hasn't actually caused any mess, so maybe her boyfriend is overreacting. But on the other hand, she's living in a shared space, and even if she hasn't had accidents, the boyfriend might be worried about potential messes. The key here is whether her choice is affecting him. She says it's been 6 months without issues, but he's still worried. \n\nThe author is getting defensive and upset, which might not be the right approach. If someone is worried about cleanliness in a shared home, maybe she should have considered that before choosing to free bleed. However, she has the right to make her own health decisions, and if she's not actually making a mess, his reaction might be unfounded. The problem here might be more about her boyfriend's reaction than her choice itself. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's not causing actual harm and is respecting their shared space by not making a mess, then she's not in the wrong. However, if she's being dismissive of his concerns without considering them, that's where she might be in the wrong. Since she hasn't actually caused a problem, maybe she's not in the wrong. But if her actions are causing emotional distress to her boyfriend, then there's a mutual issue. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be the bigger problem here. The author is upset because he's invalidating her choice, which he shouldn't do. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
