He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding. The author mentions they do this and their boyfriend is upset about it, saying it's gross and they're not acting like an adult. The boyfriend is worried about staining things, even though the author hasn't stained anything except their underwear over six months. The author is upset and feels called out as a \"basic white girl feminist\" and is crying in the spare bedroom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, it's when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets blood flow naturally. It's a personal choice related to body autonomy, which some people support as a feminist stance, while others might find unhygienic or uncomfortable. \n\nThe boyfriend's concern is about potential mess affecting their shared living space. The author argues they haven't caused any issues beyond their underwear. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about a hypothetical scenario (if something happens he'll be angry) rather than actual incidents. The author is getting mad at the boyfriend's overreaction and being called disgusting. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Factors to consider: personal choice vs. shared responsibility. The author's choice is legal and their body, but the boyfriend might feel that the potential for mess affects him too. However, if there's no actual problem, is the boyfriend overreacting? Also, the boyfriend's insults (\"basic white girl feminist,\" calling her gross) might be contributing to the conflict. The author is defensive about their choice and the boyfriend's comments are personal attacks.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people are usually in the wrong if they've done something harmful or unreasonable. The author isn't causing actual harm; it's a personal hygiene choice. The boyfriend is projecting fear of a possible issue that hasn't happened. The insults from the boyfriend are problematic. So the author isn't in the wrong for being mad at his reaction. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
