I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author free-bleeding, which her boyfriend has a problem with. Free-bleeding is when someone allows menstrual blood to flow naturally without using any menstrual products. The boyfriend is upset because he's worried about staining things, even though the author hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear. He's calling her gross and comparing her to a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which is pretty harsh. The author is upset and crying, feeling insulted.\n\nSo, the main points here are consent and mutual respect in a relationship. The author chose to free-bleed, which is a personal choice and a feminist stance for some. However, she mentioned it casually while talking with her boyfriend and roommate. The issue arises because her boyfriend is now upset about the potential for staining, even though it hasn't happened. The question is whether her choice infringes on his comfort in their shared living space.\n\nOn one hand, using their shared space, the boyfriend might feel that the risk of staining is a valid concern, especially if they have to clean up together. But on the other hand, the author hasn't actually caused any problems, and her choice is a personal one related to her body and finances. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his discomfort and judgment rather than an actual problem. He's also making derogatory comments, which is not okay. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are causing actual harm or if the boyfriend is overreacting. Since the author hasn't stained anything and is practicing free-bleeding in a way that doesn't affect others (like only changing her underwear), maybe the boyfriend's issue is more about his own feelings rather than her actions. However, in a shared living situation, it's important to consider each other's comfort. But the boyfriend's response seems to be disrespectful and judgmental, which is not a healthy way to address concerns.\n\nThe author getting mad is understandable if her boyfriend is being dismissive and insulting. He's not respecting her choice and is making her feel bad about her decision. The fact that he calls her a \"basic white girl feminist\" is particularly problematic because it's a stereotype and not a constructive criticism. So, while the author's choice might be a personal one, the boyfriend's reaction is more about his own issues and not respecting her autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing to free-bleed, especially since it's her body and there's no evidence of actual harm. The boyfriend's overreaction and disrespect are the main problems here. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
