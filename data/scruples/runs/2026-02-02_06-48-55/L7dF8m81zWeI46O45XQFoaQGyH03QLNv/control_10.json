He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves free bleeding, which is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and instead lets blood flow naturally. The boyfriend is upset about it, saying it's gross and that the author isn't acting like an adult. The author is upset because the boyfriend is overreacting, even though she hasn't actually stained anything beyond her underwear.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what free bleeding entails. It's a personal choice, often related to body autonomy, environmental concerns, or financial reasons. The author mentions not wanting to spend money on tampons, so that's a valid reason. However, the boyfriend is concerned about potential stains and seems judgmental, calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and saying she's disgusting. That language is pretty harsh and dismissive.\n\nNext, the context of their living situation. The author shares a home with the boyfriend and a roommate. If she's free bleeding, there's a possibility of blood being present in common areas, but she says she hasn't stained anything except her underwear. The boyfriend's main issue seems to be the fear or anxiety that this could happen, even if it hasn't. Is that a reasonable concern? Maybe, but he's also making personal attacks instead of discussing practical solutions.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Free bleeding is a personal choice and a valid expression of body autonomy. The boyfriend's criticism is based on his discomfort, but that doesn't necessarily make her choice wrong. However, if she's causing a mess that affects others, that could be a point of contention. But she hasn't actually caused any issues beyond her own underwear. The boyfriend's reaction seems excessive and disrespectful, especially with the name-calling.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a middle ground. The author could consider using protective measures if she's free bleeding, like wearing dark clothing or using cloth pads, to minimize any potential issues. But the core of the problem here is the boyfriend's judgmental attitude rather than the author's actions. He's not respecting her choice and is making her feel bad about it, which is a problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author is making a personal choice that hasn't caused actual harm or mess, while the boyfriend is being judgmental and aggressive. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
