He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong based on the situation described. The main issue is about free bleeding, which is a choice to not use menstrual products and let blood flow freely. The author mentions doing this for six months without staining anything except her underwear. Her boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and a \"basic white girl feminist,\" while she's upset about his reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Free bleeding is a personal choice and can be part of feminist or body autonomy discussions. The author isn't causing actual harm beyond the boyfriend's concerns. She's been doing it for six months without incident, so maybe her method is effective. The boyfriend's reaction seems emotional and possibly judgmental. He's projecting his worries onto her, which might not be fair. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend is uncomfortable but there's no actual problem (no stains, etc.), then his reaction might be the issue. The author's choice to free bleed is her body autonomy. However, living together means considering others' feelings. But if she's not actually making a mess, maybe she's not at fault. The boyfriend's insults and calling her names could be his problem. She's reacting to his judgment, which might be valid. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
