He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is the asshole here. The situation involves the author free-bleeding and her boyfriend being upset about it. Free bleeding is a personal choice where someone doesn't use menstrual products and lets blood flow naturally. The boyfriend is upset because he's worried about staining things, even though the author hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is choosing not to use tampons, which could be due to financial reasons or personal preference. The boyfriend is criticizing her for being gross and not acting like an adult. The author is upset because he's making her feel like she's doing something wrong. \n\nThe key points here are consent, personal choice, and mutual respect. The boyfriend is overreacting because the author hasn't actually caused any mess beyond her underwear. His reaction seems to be based on his own discomfort rather than any real issue. The author isn't violating any laws or health codes, just making a personal choice. \n\nHowever, it's a shared living space, so there might be some consideration for each other's comfort. But the boyfriend's response is harsh\u2014calling her gross and using the term \"basic white girl feminist\" is dismissive and potentially hurtful. The author's right to make her own health decisions is important here. \n\nThe boyfriend's main issue is the fear of staining things, but the author hasn't done that yet. His reaction seems more about his own anxiety than an actual problem. The author being upset about his criticism is valid because her choice is being policed, especially in a feminist context. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the boyfriend is in the wrong for overreacting and disrespecting her choice. The author isn't wrong for being upset about that. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
