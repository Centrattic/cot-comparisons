I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves free bleeding, which is a personal choice some women make regarding their menstrual hygiene. The author mentions that she talks about it casually with her boyfriend and roommate. Her boyfriend is upset because he thinks she's gross and not acting like an adult for not buying tampons. She's been doing this for six months without staining anything except her underwear, but he's still upset. She's mad at him, and he's calling her a basic white feminist and being dismissive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if her choice to free bleed is her right. Free bleeding is a personal decision, and while it might be uncomfortable for others to understand, it's a valid choice for many. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his own discomfort or judgment. The key points here are her autonomy in making her own health decisions and his overreaction. Also, the fact that she hasn't caused any mess beyond her underwear might indicate she's managing it well. The boyfriend's criticism about her spending money on tampons could be a financial judgment, but it's not her responsibility to explain her choices if they don't harm others. The emotional impact on her\u2014crying and needing to go to the spare room\u2014shows that his criticism is affecting her negatively. The roommate aspect is mentioned, but she hasn't caused any issues there. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that if the boyfriend lives there, he has a right to feel comfortable. However, free bleeding is a personal choice, and unless she's causing actual problems, his reaction seems unwarranted. The term \"basic white girl feminist\" he used is a stereotype and dismissive, which might indicate his own biases rather than a valid concern. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for making a personal choice and being upset about his judgment. The boyfriend's overreaction and the use of derogatory terms suggest he's the one with issues here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
