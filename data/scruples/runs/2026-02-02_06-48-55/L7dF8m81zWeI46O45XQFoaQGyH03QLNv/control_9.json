He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for free bleeding and the conflict with their boyfriend.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice. People choose it for various reasons like body autonomy, environmental concerns, or financial reasons. The author mentions not wanting to spend money on tampons, so that's valid. However, the boyfriend is upset about potential messes, even though the author hasn't had any issues in six months. \n\nThe key points here are consent and living arrangements. The author is in their own home, so they have the right to make personal health decisions. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about control or discomfort with the practice, not actual harm caused. The author's frustration is about being criticized for a choice that doesn't actually cause problems. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument about being \"gross\" and calling it a \"basic white girl feminist\" thing comes off as dismissive and maybe even sexist. The author's reaction is understandable if they feel their autonomy is being attacked. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of shared living. If the practice could potentially cause issues (like bleeding on common areas), maybe there's a need for communication. However, the author states they haven't had any accidents, so the boyfriend's worry seems unfounded. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. They made a choice that's their own, and the boyfriend's overreaction is the main issue. The author's anger stems from being criticized for a harmless personal choice. So, the answer is B.\n"
