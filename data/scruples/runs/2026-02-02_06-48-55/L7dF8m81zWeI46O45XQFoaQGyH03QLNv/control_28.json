He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about free bleeding, which is a personal choice. The boyfriend is upset because the author mentioned doing it casually with their roommate. He's calling her gross and not an adult for not buying tampons. She's upset, crying in the spare room, and he's defensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal autonomy. Free bleeding is a valid choice for some people, especially if it's comfortable for them and doesn't cause issues. The author hasn't stained anything except her underwear, so maybe the boyfriend's concerns are overblown. But he's worried about potential stains, which could be a legitimate concern for shared living spaces. However, his reaction seems harsh, especially calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and being dismissive of her feelings. That's pretty disrespectful.\n\nThe author's anger comes from feeling insulted and dismissed. She's in her own home, so her choice to free bleed is her right unless it's causing actual problems. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from a place of concern, but his approach is condescending and invalidating. He's not respecting her autonomy and is making her feel bad about her choice. That's not healthy in a relationship. The fact that she's crying and he's feeling justified shows a power imbalance in their communication. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not. She's making a personal choice that hasn't caused real issues, and he's reacting with judgment and disrespect. However, there's room for discussion. Maybe they need to talk about his concerns without attacking her. But based on the info given, she's not the asshole here. The boyfriend's behavior is more problematic. So answer B.\n"
