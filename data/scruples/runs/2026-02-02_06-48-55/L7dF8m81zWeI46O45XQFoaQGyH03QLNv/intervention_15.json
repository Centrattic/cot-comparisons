He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding and a conflict with her boyfriend and roommate. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author mentions free bleeding, which is a choice some people make to forgo menstrual products like tampons or pads. The boyfriend is upset about it, saying she's gross and not an adult. He's worried about staining things, even though she hasn't actually done so except for her underwear. She's upset with him for being judgmental and called her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and disgusting. Now she's crying in the spare room with her cats.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFree bleeding is a personal choice, and while it might be unconventional, it's a valid decision for some. The author's actions don't directly harm others; she's only not using products, and there's no evidence of actual messes beyond her underwear. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about potential messes, but that's a projection. However, living with others means respecting their comfort. If her choice is causing tension, maybe she should consider that. But the boyfriend's response is also harsh\u2014calling her names and implying she's acting out of a specific feminist ideology without understanding her reasons might be the bigger issue. \n\nThe roommate aspect isn't clear\u2014does the roommate have a say here? The author is in her own home, so her right to make personal choices, even if it's about bodily functions, is important. The boyfriend's concern might be valid in a shared space, but his method of addressing it is confrontational and disrespectful. \n\nSo the author is upset about being judged and called names, which is a valid emotional response. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own discomfort and maybe a lack of understanding. The key here is whether the author's actions are objectively wrong. Free bleeding isn't illegal or harmful to others unless it affects them directly. Since she hasn't caused any actual mess, his concerns are speculative. However, living in a shared space does require some consideration. But the boyfriend's approach is aggressive and dismissive. \n\nIn terms of being an adult, not spending money on products isn't necessarily irresponsible if she's managing her cycle safely. The author's actions don't seem to harm others. The boyfriend's problem is more about his own feelings rather than real harm. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for free bleeding, but maybe there's a communication issue. However, the boyfriend's harsh judgment and attack on her character are the main problems here. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
