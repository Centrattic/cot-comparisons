I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author discussing her choice to free bleed (which is using no menstrual products and allowing blood to flow freely) with her boyfriend and roommate. Her boyfriend is upset about it, calling her gross and suggesting she's not an adult for not buying tampons. The author is now upset and crying because he's upset with her, and he's even accused her of being a \"basic white girl feminist\" and disgusting. The question is whether she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Free bleeding is a personal choice and part of body autonomy. Some people choose it for various reasons, like financial constraints, environmental concerns, or personal preference. However, it's important to consider the living environment and the impact on others. The roommate situation is mentioned, so maybe the boyfriend is concerned about potential stains or hygiene in shared spaces.\n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. He's taken it to a level that's making the author feel insulted and upset. Calling someone gross and implying they're not acting like an adult crosses a line. The author hasn't caused any actual issues beyond her underwear, and she's been doing this for six months without problems. The boyfriend's anger seems more about his own discomfort or judgment rather than any real harm caused.\n\nThe accusation of being a \"basic white girl feminist\" is a bit confusing. It might be a dismissive comment meant to belittle her stance, possibly conflating her choice with a broader feminist movement, which isn't directly relevant here. The key point is that the boyfriend is making her feel bad for a personal choice that doesn't harm others, especially since there's no history of staining shared items.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the asshole here. She's making a personal health and lifestyle choice. Her boyfriend's reaction is about his own boundaries and comfort, which is valid, but how he's expressing it\u2014through insults and making her feel guilty\u2014is where the problem lies. The author has the right to make her own choices as long as they don't infringe on others' rights. Since she hasn't stained anything beyond her own belongings, his overreaction isn't justified. Therefore, the boyfriend is in the wrong, and the author isn't the asshole.\n"
