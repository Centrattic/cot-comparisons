I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding, where the author is doing it and their boyfriend is upset about it. The roommate is also involved in the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, it's when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets menstrual blood flow out naturally, often without using tampons, pads, etc. People might choose this for various reasons like environmental concerns, cost, or body autonomy. However, it can lead to practical issues like staining clothes or bedding if not managed properly.\n\nThe author mentions that they've been free bleeding for 6 months and haven't stained anything except their underwear. The boyfriend is upset about the possibility of staining other things, even though it hasn't happened yet. The roommate might also be involved in the conversation, which could be why the boyfriend is upset the author mentioned it in front of him. The boyfriend is calling the author gross and a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which seems like a stereotype or insult. The author is upset and crying, feeling that the boyfriend is overreacting.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is making a personal choice about their body, which is a valid right. However, living in a shared space means considering others' comfort. If the author is practicing free bleeding in a way that doesn't affect others (like only staining their own underwear), it might be their choice. But if the boyfriend is concerned about potential stains on shared items, there's a conflict between personal choice and shared living considerations.\n\nBut the author hasn't actually stained anything else beyond their underwear. The boyfriend's concern is about a hypothetical situation. The author might be justified in feeling their choice is being criticized unfairly. The boyfriend's reaction seems harsh, especially using insults about feminism and calling them gross. The roommate being involved could mean that the boyfriend took the comment to another person, escalating the issue unnecessarily.\n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? They're defending their personal choice, which is a right, and the boyfriend's overreaction is the problem. The roommate's involvement might not be the author's fault. The boyfriend's accusations of being gross and using a stereotype to belittle her could be the real issue here. So the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for their choice and being upset by the boyfriend's reaction.\n"
