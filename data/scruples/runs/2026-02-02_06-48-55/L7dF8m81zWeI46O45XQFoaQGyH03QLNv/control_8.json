He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding, which is a choice some people make for various reasons\u2014health, cost, environmental, etc. The author mentions they've been free bleeding for 6+ months without any issues except their underwear. The boyfriend is upset, saying it's gross and affecting him because they live together. The author feels insulted and is now in the spare room crying.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice. The author is not harming anyone except possibly the boyfriend if there's a mess, but they say they haven't stained anything else. The boyfriend is upset about potential future issues, but if there's no history of problems, maybe his reaction is overblown. The author's defense is about cost and autonomy. The boyfriend's argument seems to be about cleanliness and his feelings, but it's hard to justify anger if there's no actual mess. Also, calling someone a \"basic white girl feminist\" and \"disgusting\" is pretty harsh and could be seen as invalidating her choice. The author getting upset in response seems reasonable, especially if the boyfriend is using guilt-tripping or attacking her character. So, the boyfriend's behavior might be the issue here, making the author not the asshole. So answer B.\n"
