I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author discussing free bleeding with their boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and acting like she's not an adult for not buying tampons. The author is upset about this and is now in the spare room crying, while the boyfriend feels justified.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, it's a practice where individuals choose not to use menstrual products like tampons or pads, allowing blood to flow naturally. It can be a personal choice related to body autonomy, cost, or environmental reasons. The author mentions they haven't stained anything except their underwear, but the boyfriend is still upset about potential accidents.\n\nThe key points here are the boyfriend's reactions. He's calling her gross and questioning her adult behavior over not buying tampons. The author is defending their choice, which seems to be about personal freedom and financial reasons. The boyfriend's concern is about possible messes affecting him as a roommate. The author is upset because they feel his criticism is unwarranted and that he's attacking their feminist views.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend is living in the same space, so there's a shared living situation. The issue might be about mutual respect and boundaries. The author's choice is personal, but it could affect others. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems harsh. If the author hasn't caused any actual issues except the possibility of an accident, then his overreaction might be the problem. The author isn't causing harm yet, and the boyfriend's accusations of being gross and a bad feminist could be dismissive of her valid reasons.\n\nBut on the other hand, sharing a home means considering others' comfort. If the author's actions make the roommate uncomfortable, even if it's about something like free bleeding, there's a mutual responsibility. However, the boyfriend's approach of calling her names and making her feel bad seems like an attack rather than a constructive discussion. The author's distress is valid if they're being belittled for their personal choices, especially if those choices don't actually create problems.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the boyfriend's overreaction and the author's personal autonomy. The author isn't causing actual harm, and the boyfriend's behavior is more aggressive. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), but I need to make sure. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend is overreacting without cause, then the author isn't wrong for being upset. The boyfriend's actions are the issue here, not the author's choice. So the answer is B.\n"
