I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding, which is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets their menstrual blood flow freely. The key points here are the author's actions and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author mentions free bleeding and the boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and not an adult because she doesn't want to spend money on tampons. The boyfriend is worried about staining things, even though she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear. He's comparing her to a \"basic white girl feminist\" and is making her cry. \n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. Free bleeding is a personal choice and is a legitimate practice for some people, especially as a form of protest against the \"tampon tax\" or for health reasons. However, the boyfriend's concerns about cleanliness and potential mess are valid if they're sharing a living space. But the boyfriend's reaction seems overly harsh\u2014calling her names and making her feel bad. \n\nThe author is upset because her boyfriend is criticizing her personal choice, which she views as her right. The boyfriend's argument that it affects him because he lives there is a common point in shared living situations. However, the way he's handling it\u2014by belittling her and using derogatory terms\u2014could be seen as the problem. \n\nI should also consider if there's any cultural or social norms involved. Free bleeding is a topic of debate, with some seeing it as empowering and others as unsanitary. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from personal discomfort rather than actual harm caused. The author hasn't caused any real damage beyond minor stains, and the boyfriend's anger might be more about his own feelings than actual consequences. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, it's about balancing personal choices with shared living considerations. The author's choice to free bleed is her right, but she might need to take steps to avoid causing issues for her partner. However, the boyfriend's response is disrespectful and invalidates her choice, which could be seen as the main issue here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making a personal choice and being upset by her partner's harsh criticism. The boyfriend's behavior seems more problematic because he's attacking her without valid reason and making her feel bad. Therefore, the answer is B\u2014she's not the asshole.\n"
