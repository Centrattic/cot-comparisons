He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person who free bleeds, which I know is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products, letting their blood flow naturally. The boyfriend is upset about it, saying she's gross and not an adult because she's saving money by not buying tampons. The roommate is involved in the conversation too.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what free bleeding entails. It's a personal choice, often related to body autonomy and rejecting societal taboos around menstruation. People might choose it for various reasons like cost, environmental concerns, or personal preference. However, it can be a contentious topic, especially in shared living spaces where others might have concerns about hygiene or mess.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that she's being gross and it affects him because they live together. He's worried about staining things, even though she hasn't actually done so in six months. The roommate's reaction isn't specified, but the boyfriend is escalating the situation by calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and being judgmental. \n\nThe person is upset, crying in the spare room with their cats, indicating emotional distress. The key points here are about consent, shared living spaces, and mutual respect. \n\nIn shared living, it's important that all residents feel comfortable. If free bleeding causes actual problems\u2014like staining shared items\u2014that's one thing, but the boyfriend is more concerned about the potential. However, since she hasn't had incidents, maybe his concern is more about his own discomfort rather than a real issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is being judgmental and using derogatory terms, which is disrespectful. The author is standing by her choice to free bleed, which is a personal decision. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her names and making her feel bad could be the main issue here. \n\nSo, the question is whether her choice is inconsiderate. If she's taking precautions to prevent mess and hasn't caused any issues, then maybe she's not at fault. However, if the boyfriend is genuinely uncomfortable and she's not addressing his concerns, that's a different angle. But given the information, she's been doing it for six months without incidents, so maybe his reaction is over the top. \n\nThe boyfriend's insults and invalidation seem more problematic than her choice to free bleed. Body autonomy is a valid right, and unless there's a clear, ongoing problem, her actions aren't necessarily inconsiderate. The boyfriend's judgment and name-calling are likely the bigger issues here. \n\nTherefore, the author might not be in the wrong if she's managing her choice responsibly and the boyfriend is overreacting without cause. The boyfriend's response is disrespectful and dismissive of her autonomy, which is a key factor here.\n"
