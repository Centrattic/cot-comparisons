He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The context is that the author mentioned free bleeding to her boyfriend and roommate. Free bleeding is when someone doesn't use menstrual products and lets their blood flow naturally, which can be a personal choice related to feminism, environmental concerns, or just not wanting to spend money.\n\nThe boyfriend is upset, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult because she doesn't buy tampons. He's worried about staining things, even though she hasn't actually stained anything in six months except her underwear. The author is getting mad at him, and he's calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and says she's disgusting. She's now crying in the spare room with her cats.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. \n\nFirst, consider the key points. Free bleeding is a personal choice. The boyfriend is making moral judgments about her decision, which is her right. He's projecting his concerns onto her, maybe without considering her perspective. Also, he's using derogatory language (\"basic white girl feminist\") which is offensive. The author is justified in being upset if he's invalidating her choice with insults. \n\nBut the boyfriend might have legitimate concerns about shared living spaces. If free bleeding could lead to stains, maybe he's worried about shared items. However, the author says she's only stained her own underwear, so maybe his concerns are exaggerated. Also, communication is key here. If he's worried, he should discuss it calmly rather than shaming her. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since free bleeding is a personal choice and the boyfriend is attacking her for it, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. His insults and overreaction are the main issues. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
