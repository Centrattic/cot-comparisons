He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discussing free bleeding with her boyfriend and roommate. She mentions she does this to save money on tampons, but her boyfriend is upset because he's worried about stains. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand free bleeding. From what I know, it's a practice where people choose not to use period products, letting blood flow freely. It's a personal choice related to body autonomy, though it can be stigmatized. The author's boyfriend is upset about the potential mess and cleanliness, but she's been doing it for six months without any issues except her underwear.\n\nThe boyfriend is calling her gross and using terms like \"basic white girl feminist,\" which might be dismissive of her choice. The author is upset because her boyfriend is overreacting despite no actual incidents. She's also crying and isolated, which suggests emotional distress.\n\nConsidering the dynamics, the boyfriend's reaction seems hypocritical given the six-month period without problems. His comments about her being gross and the feminist remark could be judgmental and not respecting her autonomy. The author's choice, while unconventional, is her personal decision, and the boyfriend's reaction might be more about his discomfort than actual harm. However, living with someone does require some consideration for shared spaces. But since she's only staining her own underwear and not common areas, maybe his concerns are unfounded.\n\nThe key points: The author isn't violating any laws or causing actual harm; she's making a personal choice that affects her own habits. The boyfriend is overreacting based on his own discomfort and projecting his worries onto her. The term \"basic white girl feminist\" is a dismissive stereotype, which undermines her stance. The emotional impact on the author is significant, leading to her feeling isolated.\n\nSo, the boyfriend's behavior seems to be the main issue here. He's not respecting her autonomy and is creating a hostile environment. The author isn't wrong for choosing to free bleed; it's her body, and as long as it's not affecting others, it's her choice. The conflict arises from his judgment rather than her actions. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
