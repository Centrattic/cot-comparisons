He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author mentions they free bleed, which means they don't use tampons or pads and let menstrual blood flow freely. They discussed this with their boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, says they're gross, and accuses them of acting like a basic white feminist. The author is upset and crying, thinking they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider free bleeding as a personal choice. It's a valid choice for some people, part of body autonomy and rejecting certain menstrual products. But the issue here is the boyfriend's reaction and the living situation. The author says they haven't stained anything except their underwear, but the boyfriend is worried about potential stains. The author is getting mad at his reaction.\n\nIs the author wrong for free bleeding? It's a personal choice, but does it affect others? They mention their roommate is involved in the conversation, so maybe the roommate is okay with it. The boyfriend's main issue seems to be the potential mess and the author's refusal to spend money on tampons. But the author isn't causing actual harm beyond their concern. The boyfriend's response might be dismissive or judgmental of their choice, which could be seen as disrespectful. The author is justified in getting upset if they feel their choice is being policed, especially if there's no actual problem. The boyfriend's use of \"basic white feminist\" is a stereotype and could be invalidating.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're making a personal choice and the boyfriend is overreacting. The author's anger is a valid response to being judged for their choice. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
