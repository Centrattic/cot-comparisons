He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author mentioned they free bleed, which means they don't use menstrual products and let blood flow naturally. The boyfriend is upset about it, saying it's gross and that they're not acting like an adult because they don't want to spend money on tampons. The author is now upset and the boyfriend is calling them a \"basic white girl feminist\" and says they're disgusting. The author is crying and the question is whether they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, free bleeding is a choice some people make for various reasons\u2014maybe environmental, financial, or personal. They don't use tampons or pads and let their blood flow without covering it. It's a personal choice, but maybe it's not widely accepted in some circles.\n\nThe boyfriend is concerned about potential stains, even though the author says they haven't stained anything except their underwear. But he's still worked up about it. The author is mad at him for being judgmental. Now, the boyfriend is calling them names related to feminism, which could be a red flag\u2014using derogatory terms or attacking someone's beliefs.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's choice versus the boyfriend's discomfort. The boyfriend is living in the same space, so he might have concerns about cleanliness or shared spaces. But is it valid to criticize someone for their personal health choices? The author's right to make their own decisions about their body is important. However, if free bleeding could affect others (like staining shared items), maybe there's a middle ground. But the author says they haven't caused any issues except their own underwear, which is their own responsibility.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems harsh, especially calling them a \"basic white girl feminist\"\u2014that's a pretty judgmental and possibly offensive label. It might be a way to dismiss their choice and invalidate their perspective. The author's right to be upset if they're being insulted for their personal decisions. Also, the boyfriend's concern about potential future stains when there haven't been any in six months might be overblown. The author is defending their choice as a personal and financial decision, which is valid.\n\nSo, the boyfriend's behavior is problematic. He's attacking the author's character and choices, which isn't healthy. The author isn't wrong for being upset when they're being insulted. The boyfriend's actions seem like he's the one being judgmental and not respecting their partner's choice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
