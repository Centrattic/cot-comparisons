He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman who free bleeds, and her boyfriend is upset about it. She's crying in the spare bedroom, and he's calling her a basic white feminist and being disgusting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, free bleeding means not using menstrual products like tampons or pads, allowing the blood to flow naturally, often wearing dark clothes to avoid stains. It's a personal choice some women make for reasons like cost, environmental concerns, or bodily autonomy.\n\nThe author mentions she's been doing this for six months without staining anything except her underwear. Her boyfriend is upset, worried about staining things. He says it affects him because he lives there. She's upset because he's judging her and calling her names. She's now crying, indicating she's hurt by his reaction.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to weigh both sides. On one hand, free bleeding is a personal choice and doesn't harm others unless it causes actual problems. If she's not making a mess, why is he so upset? Maybe he has a low tolerance for blood or has a different standard of cleanliness. On the other hand, if her choice is causing her emotional distress because her partner is so judgmental, that's an issue in their relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems harsh. Calling someone a \"basic white girl feminist\" is dismissive and possibly rude. It's a stereotype and could be a way to invalidate her choice without understanding her reasons. If she's not causing actual harm (like staining his belongings), his anger might be overblown. The fact that she's been doing this for six months without issues suggests it's manageable.\n\nHowever, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the boyfriend is just concerned about hygiene or potential messes, maybe there's a middle ground. But if he's being overly critical and it's causing emotional harm, he's the one in the wrong. The author's choice is personal, and unless she's violating shared house rules or causing actual damage, she's not wrong for making that choice. His judgment and name-calling are the issues here.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. Her choice to free bleed is her right, and his reaction is the problem. She has the right to make personal health decisions as long as they don't harm others. His behavior is the issue, not hers."
