He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for free bleeding and getting upset when her boyfriend criticizes her. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, it's when someone chooses not to use menstrual products like tampons or pads and instead lets the blood flow naturally. Some people do this for personal reasons, like cost, environmental concerns, or body acceptance.\n\nThe author mentions she's been doing this for six months without staining anything except her underwear. Her boyfriend is upset, thinking it's gross and affects him because they live together. He compares her to a \"basic white girl feminist\" and calls her disgusting. She's upset and is in the spare room crying.\n\nNow, considering the situation, the author isn't causing harm beyond her underwear. She's not using products, which might be a personal choice, and if she's managing it without causing issues, maybe her boyfriend is overreacting. But since they share a living space, maybe there are legitimate concerns if there's a risk of stains elsewhere, but she says that hasn't happened. \n\nThe boyfriend's response seems harsh and judgmental. Calling her names and dismissing her reasons as a \"basic white girl feminist\" is probably not constructive. The author's reaction to being criticized is understandable if she feels her choice is being invalidated. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If her choice is a personal one that doesn't harm others (and she's managing it without issues), then maybe the boyfriend is the one overstepping. But if there's a real risk of mess that affects others, maybe there's something there. However, since she hasn't had any issues, it seems like the boyfriend is being unnecessarily critical. \n\nThe key points are personal choice vs. shared living space. Since she's not causing problems, her choice is her own. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his feelings rather than actual harm. So the answer would likely be B (author not in the wrong) because it's her body and her choice, and the boyfriend's criticism is unwarranted.\n"
