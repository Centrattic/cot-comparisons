He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author free-bleeding, which means not using menstrual products and allowing menstrual blood to exit the body naturally. The boyfriend is upset about this, saying it's gross and that the author isn't acting like an adult. The roommate is also involved in the conversation.\n\nFirst, free-bleeding is a personal choice, and while it might be a hygiene issue for some people, others choose it for various reasons like cost, environmental concerns, or personal preference. The author mentions they haven't stained anything besides their underwear, so maybe the boyfriend is overreacting. But the key here is that they live together, so there's a shared living space. The boyfriend feels affected by her choice, which is valid because he's part of the household. The author is upset because he's judging her and calling her a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which might be a dismissive comment.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the free-bleeding isn't actually causing any problems beyond the boyfriend's concerns, then maybe the issue is more about his discomfort rather than actual harm. However, if the author is not respecting his feelings or the shared living space, that could be a problem. The boyfriend's reaction might be based on his own values or discomfort, but the author's choice is also personal. \n\nIn shared living situations, respecting each other's boundaries is important. If the author's free-bleeding isn't causing actual messes or issues, then the boyfriend's reaction might be more about his personal feelings rather than an objective problem. However, if the author isn't considering his perspective and is causing emotional distress, that could be on her. But since she hasn't actually stained anything, maybe the boyfriend is being overly anxious. The fact that the author is upset and feeling criticized might mean she's in the right in terms of her choice, but perhaps not in how she's handling the situation. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the boyfriend is right to be concerned about potential messes in a shared space, even if it hasn't happened yet. The author's decision to free-bleed might be acceptable in her own space, but if it affects others, that's a different matter. Since the boyfriend is also living there, his feelings are valid. The author could be in the wrong if she's not being considerate of his feelings, even if her choice is personal. \n\nBut the boyfriend's accusations about her being a \"basic white girl feminist\" seem dismissive and could be contributing to the conflict. That might be his issue, not necessarily the free-bleeding itself. If the author is only free-bleeding in her own underwear and hasn't caused any problems, then the boyfriend's reaction is more about his own discomfort. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the author isn't addressing his concerns or is being dismissive of them, that could tip the balance. \n\nSo considering all that, I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing free-bleeding if it's not causing actual issues. The boyfriend's reaction seems based on his own discomfort rather than any real harm. The key factor is whether the free-bleeding is affecting others in a tangible way. Since the author hasn't stained anything except her underwear, the boyfriend's concerns might be unfounded. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
