He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author free-bleeding, which is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products like tampons or pads and instead lets the blood flow naturally, often wearing specific clothing to manage it. The boyfriend is upset about this and says the author is gross and not acting like an adult because she's not buying tampons. The roommate is also involved in the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. Free-bleeding is a personal choice and can be a political or feminist stance against the high cost and corporate control of menstrual products. However, the boyfriend is worried about the possibility of staining things, even though the author hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear. He's also upset about the potential mess affecting the living space. The author is upset because her boyfriend is being judgmental and using terms like \"basic white girl feminist\" which is a stereotype and could be dismissive of her valid reasons.\n\nThe key points here are personal choice versus shared living space considerations. The author is not causing actual harm beyond her underwear, but the boyfriend is concerned about potential mess. However, his reaction seems extreme and judgmental, attacking her motives and using a stereotype. The author's anger is in response to being called gross and dismissed, which is a valid emotional reaction. \n\nIt's important to note that free-bleeding is a personal decision, and while it might not be the norm, it's not inherently wrong. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from discomfort or lack of understanding rather than a legitimate concern about cleanliness if the author is managing it properly. The fact that the boyfriend is bringing in the roommate into the criticism could also be a factor in escalating the conflict.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to free-bleed. The boyfriend's dismissal and judgment are the issues here. The author's anger is justified if she feels disrespected and attacked. The boyfriend's use of a stereotype (\"basic white girl feminist\") is a red flag for invalidating her perspective without understanding her reasons. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic, and the author's choice is a personal one that doesn't unjustly affect the shared living space significantly if she's managing it without issues beyond her underwear.\n"
