He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author talks about free bleeding, which they do to avoid spending money on tampons. The boyfriend is upset because he's worried about possible stains, even though it hasn't happened in six months except for the underwear. The boyfriend's reaction seems judgmental, calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and saying she's disgusting. The author is now upset and feeling targeted.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice some women make for various reasons, including cost, environmental concerns, or body autonomy. It's not inherently a problem, but the situation is about how it's affecting their living space and relationship. The author mentions that the only stains have been on her underwear, so maybe the boyfriend's concerns are unfounded. However, living together does require consideration of each other's comfort and cleanliness.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems harsh. Making derogatory comments about someone's choices, especially using terms like \"basic white girl feminist,\" is dismissive and could be seen as invalidating. Calling someone disgusting for a health-related choice is not productive. The author's anger at being judged might be justified here. However, the author also needs to consider if her choice is causing unnecessary stress for her partner. If the boyfriend is genuinely concerned about cleanliness and the possibility of accidents, communication is key. Maybe there's a middle ground, like setting boundaries or using certain areas where free bleeding is done to minimize concerns.\n\nThe fact that the author has been doing this for six months without issues might support her position, but if the boyfriend is genuinely uncomfortable, mutual respect is necessary. The author might not be in the wrong for choosing to free bleed, but maybe she could have discussed the boyfriend's concerns more to find a compromise. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction seems out of proportion and judgmental. The author's feelings of being insulted are valid if the boyfriend is being disrespectful. So, considering both sides, the author might not be in the wrong, but there's room for both parties to communicate better.\n"
