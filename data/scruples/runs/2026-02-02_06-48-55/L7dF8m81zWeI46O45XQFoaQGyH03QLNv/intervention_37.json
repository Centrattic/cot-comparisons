He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding, which is a choice some people make for various reasons like cost, environmental concerns, or personal preference. The author mentions they've been doing this for six months without staining anything except their underwear. The boyfriend is upset about it, calling them gross and not acting like an adult, and even accuses them of being a \"basic white girl feminist\" and being disgusting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's choice to free bleed is a personal decision. They might have valid reasons, such as financial constraints or a desire to avoid using disposable products. On the other hand, the boyfriend might be concerned about hygiene issues, especially since they live together. If there's a risk of staining shared spaces, maybe he's worried about cleanliness or the potential for accidents that could affect both of them. However, the author hasn't actually caused any stains beyond their underwear, which might suggest that their method is working without causing issues.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The author isn't forcing their choice on others; they're making a personal choice that hasn't impacted others negatively. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own discomfort or judgment rather than actual harm. Insulting the author and calling them names like \"disgusting\" is disrespectful and not a constructive way to address concerns. The author being upset and taking it to the spare room indicates emotional distress from the boyfriend's harsh response.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. If the boyfriend had legitimate concerns, he should have discussed them calmly to find a middle ground, maybe suggesting alternatives like using reusable pads if cost is an issue. Instead, he's dismissing her choice and attacking her character, which isn't healthy.\n\nHowever, the author could potentially consider the boyfriend's feelings if there's a valid concern. But in this case, since there's no evidence of actual stains beyond the underwear, the boyfriend's reaction might be overblown. The author isn't in the wrong for making a personal choice that doesn't harm others. The real issue is the boyfriend's invalidation and harsh judgment, which is unkind and unfair.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
