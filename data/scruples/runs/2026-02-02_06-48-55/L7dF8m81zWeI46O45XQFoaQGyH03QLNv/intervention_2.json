He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about free bleeding and the boyfriend's reaction. The author mentions discussing periods with her boyfriend and roommate, casually bringing up that she free bleeds. The boyfriend is upset, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult for not buying tampons. He's worried about staining things, even though she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear over six months. The author is upset and crying, feeling he's being unjustified.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice some people make for various reasons\u2014maybe financial, environmental, or body autonomy. The key here is whether her choice is affecting others. The boyfriend is concerned about potential messes and being disgusted, but the author hasn't actually caused any issues except for her own underwear. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his discomfort rather than any real harm. He's labeling her actions as gross and making her feel like an asshole for being mad, which could be dismissive of her autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have considered her roommate's presence as well. If she's free bleeding in shared spaces, maybe there's a reason to be cautious. But the question is about the boyfriend specifically. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his personal discomfort rather than any actual problem caused. The author is getting upset because he's criticizing her choice and making her feel bad. His use of terms like \"basic white girl feminist\" might be a way to invalidate her stance, which is a form of gaslighting or undermining her. \n\nThe author's right to make a personal choice about her body should be respected unless it's causing direct harm. Since there's no mention of her actions affecting others beyond his emotional reaction, the boyfriend's response seems unwarranted. The author isn't the one causing a mess, so she's justified in being upset. Therefore, the boyfriend's reaction is more in the wrong, making the author not the asshole here.\n"
