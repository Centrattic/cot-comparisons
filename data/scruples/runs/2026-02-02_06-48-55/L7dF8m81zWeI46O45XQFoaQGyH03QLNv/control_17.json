I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about free bleeding, which I think is when someone chooses to menstruate without using tampons or pads. The author mentions they've been doing this for six months and only stained their underwear. The boyfriend is upset, saying it's gross and that the author isn't acting like an adult because they're not spending money on tampons. He's worried about staining things, even though it hasn't happened beyond underwear. The author is upset and feels insulted, and now they're in a spare room crying.\n\nFirst, the concept of free bleeding is a personal choice. It's about bodily autonomy and personal preferences regarding menstruation. The author isn't harming anyone else except potentially by staining things, but they haven't actually done that. The boyfriend is upset about it, but is that justified? If the author is only staining their own underwear and not other shared spaces, maybe the boyfriend's concern is overblown. However, if they're in a shared living space, maybe there's a concern about cleaning up or potential messes. But the author hasn't caused any issues beyond their own underwear, so maybe the boyfriend is being too anxious or judgmental.\n\nThe boyfriend's comment about it being \"basic white girl feminist\" is a bit odd. That seems like a stereotype and could be dismissive of her choice. He's calling her choices into question by linking them to a stereotype, which is probably not helpful. The author getting upset about being called gross and having her partner be so worked up might be a valid reaction. \n\nIs the author wrong for free bleeding? Probably not. It's a personal choice and not against the law. The boyfriend is upset but hasn't had any real issues except for the hypothetical mess. The author hasn't violated any shared agreements if they're only staining their own clothes. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his feelings and maybe his own discomfort rather than the actual impact. So the author isn't in the wrong for free bleeding, but maybe there's an issue in how they communicate or handle the situation. However, the question is whether the author is the asshole for getting mad at the boyfriend. Since the boyfriend is judgmental and making personal attacks, the author's anger is understandable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
