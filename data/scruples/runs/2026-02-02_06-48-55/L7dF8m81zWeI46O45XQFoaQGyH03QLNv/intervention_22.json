He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation involving free bleeding and their boyfriend's reaction. \n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice. Some people prefer it for various reasons, like cost, health, or personal beliefs. The author mentions they haven't stained anything except their underwear for six months, which suggests they're managing it without issues. \n\nThe boyfriend is upset about potential messes and calls her gross, leading to conflict. The author is getting mad at his reaction. Now, whether the author is in the wrong depends on a few factors. \n\nFree bleeding itself isn't inherently wrong. It's a personal choice, and there's no universal right or wrong here. However, if their method of free bleeding is causing a mess or affecting others, that might be a consideration. The author says they haven't stained anything except underwear, so maybe the boyfriend's worries are exaggerated. \n\nBut the boyfriend's concern about living in the same space is valid. If free bleeding could lead to accidents or discomfort for him, there's a need for mutual respect. The problem might be communication\u2014maybe the boyfriend didn't realize how careful she's been. \n\nThe author's anger at being called gross is understandable. Insulting someone for a personal health choice is not okay. However, the situation is more about differing perspectives. The boyfriend might feel his concerns are valid, while the author feels judged. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If their free bleeding isn't causing actual problems and they're managing it responsibly, then not. But if their actions are disregarding the boyfriend's feelings without compromise, maybe there's room for both to adjust. However, since they mention no actual messes, the main issue is the boyfriend's reaction. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong) because personal choices like free bleeding aren't inherently wrong, especially when managed responsibly. The boyfriend's judgment and overreaction seem to be the main issues here.\n"
