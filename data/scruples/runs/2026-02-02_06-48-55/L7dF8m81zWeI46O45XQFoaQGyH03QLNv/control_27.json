He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author free-bleeding, which is a personal choice some people make for various reasons, including cost or environmental concerns. The boyfriend is upset that she might stain things, even though she hasn't in six months. He's calling her gross and using terms like \"basic white girl feminist,\" which is a bit of a stereotype.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if free-bleeding is inherently wrong. From what I know, free-bleeding is a personal choice and not inherently gross. It's about personal autonomy and what works for the individual, as long as it's done responsibly. The author mentions she's been doing it for six months without staining anything except her underwear, so maybe her approach is manageable. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems over the top. He's making her feel bad about her choice, which is a personal decision, and even using derogatory terms. That's not a healthy response. The author is upset and crying, which shows the emotional impact. \n\nThe roommate is part of the discussion, so maybe the boyfriend is projecting his discomfort onto others. However, since the author hasn't caused any issues, the boyfriend's anger seems misplaced. The author isn't violating any rules or harming others, so getting mad at her for a personal choice is unfair. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it affects him because he lives there is a bit weak if there's no actual mess. It sounds like he's more upset about his own discomfort than any real problem. The author's choice is valid, and the boyfriend's reaction is more about his own issues rather than a legitimate concern. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend is the one being unreasonable and disrespectful. The answer should be B.\n"
