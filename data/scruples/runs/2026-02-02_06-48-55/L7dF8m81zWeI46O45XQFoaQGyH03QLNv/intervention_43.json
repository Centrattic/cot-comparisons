He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author free-bleeding, which means not using menstrual products and allowing blood to flow freely. The boyfriend is upset about this, saying it's gross and affecting him because they live together. The author feels insulted and is now in the spare room crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Free-bleeding is a personal choice, often related to cost, accessibility, or personal preference. The author mentions not wanting to spend money on tampons, which could be a valid reason, especially if finances are tight. However, the issue arises because the boyfriend is worried about potential stains and feels the author is being inconsiderate.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. Living together means considering each other's comfort. If the author's free-bleeding has not caused any actual mess beyond her underwear, maybe the boyfriend's concerns are exaggerated. But if the possibility of stains is a real issue for him, the author might need to address it. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction of calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and being dismissive seems harsh and possibly invalidating her choice. That could be where the boyfriend is in the wrong.\n\nHowever, the author did mention the practice in front of their roommate, which might have been a mistake if it made others uncomfortable. But the main conflict is with the boyfriend. The boyfriend's reaction leading to the author being in the spare room suggests a lack of support and empathy from him. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the balance between her right to make personal health choices and his right to a comfortable living environment. If there's no real issue beyond his worries, then perhaps the boyfriend is overreacting. But if the author is aware of potential problems and not taking precautions, that could be a point against her. However, the boyfriend's insults and lack of understanding seem more problematic. The author's anger in this case might be justified if the boyfriend is not respecting her choices. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but I need to be sure.\n"
