He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author mentioning that she free bleeds, which is when someone doesn't use menstrual products and lets blood flow naturally. Her boyfriend is upset about it, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult because she's not buying tampons. The roommate is also involved, but the main conflict is with the boyfriend. The author is upset because her boyfriend is overreacting, and she's crying in the spare room. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to understand free bleeding. It's a personal choice where some people choose not to use sanitary products to avoid waste or cost. However, if someone is free bleeding in shared spaces or in a way that affects others, that could be a problem. The author mentions that she's only stained her underwear and nothing else in the past six months. The boyfriend is worried about staining things, even though it hasn't happened yet. \n\nNow, the boyfriend's argument is that free bleeding is gross and affects him because they live together. He's called her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and \"disgusting,\" which is pretty harsh. The author is mad at him for being upset and for the insults. \n\nThe key points here are about personal choices, shared living spaces, and mutual respect. The author is within her rights to make personal health choices, including free bleeding if she's comfortable with it and not causing harm. However, if her actions are creating a mess in common areas or affecting the roommate/boyfriend, that's a different story. The author says she hasn't stained anything else, so maybe the boyfriend's concern is unfounded. On the other hand, the boyfriend's reaction might be about his discomfort or potential future issues, not current ones.\n\nThe boyfriend's insults and the author being forced to cry suggest that he's not respecting her choice and is making personal attacks. The author's choice isn't harming others if she's following through on keeping things clean. The boyfriend's overreaction might be based on his own discomfort rather than actual harm. \n\nIn terms of shared living responsibilities, it's reasonable for both parties to have some expectations. If the author is free bleeding in a way that doesn't affect others, then the boyfriend shouldn't be upset. However, if she's not maintaining hygiene or cleanliness, that's a problem. The author says she hasn't stained anything except her underwear, so maybe her habits are okay. \n\nThe boyfriend's approach seems to be dismissive of her reasons and attacking her character rather than discussing practical concerns. The author's frustration is valid if the boyfriend isn't considering her choice as a personal decision unless it's causing actual problems. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong if she's free bleeding in a way that doesn't interfere with others and she's maintaining cleanliness. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own discomfort and judgment rather than actual harm. His insults and overreaction are unkind, which makes the author's anger justified. So, likely the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong), but I need to make sure I didn't miss any key details. The author is upset because the boyfriend isn't respecting her choice and is making it personal. The boyfriend's justification seems weak if there's no actual issue beyond his own feelings. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
