I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author mentions casually to her boyfriend and roommate that she free bleeds. Free bleeding is when someone doesn't use menstrual products and lets the blood flow naturally, right? The boyfriend is really upset about this, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult because she's not spending money on tampons. The author is upset because he's overreacting, even though she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear. She's now in the spare bedroom crying, and he's justified in his feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's choice to free bleed is a personal decision. Some people choose it for various reasons\u2014maybe environmental concerns, cost, or personal comfort. The boyfriend is worried about potential messes and feels that her choice affects him since he lives there. The author is frustrated because he's making her feel bad for her choice and calling her names like being a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which seems dismissive and maybe hypocritical.\n\nIs the author wrong for free bleeding? Probably not. It's her body, and unless it's causing a direct problem (which she says it hasn't, except for her underwear), she should have the right to choose. The boyfriend's reaction seems excessive. However, the key point is that she's in a shared living space. Even if she hasn't stained anything, the boyfriend might have concerns about the possibility. But his response\u2014calling her gross and dismissing her reasons\u2014doesn't sound constructive. He should communicate his concerns respectfully instead of attacking her character.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could consider her boyfriend's perspective. Maybe there's a middle ground, like cleaning up properly or using a specific area to minimize any potential mess. But she hasn't done anything to cause actual problems, so the boyfriend's reaction seems more about his discomfort than a real issue. Also, the way he's framing it as affecting him by living there might not be valid if she's not actually making a mess. The fact that he's name-calling and isolating her (she's in the spare room) is not healthy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing free bleeding. Her boyfriend's overreaction and the way he's handling it are the main issues. He should address his concerns without judgment and find a respectful solution instead of making her feel like an asshole.\n"
