He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves free bleeding, a choice the author makes, and her boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice some people make for bodily autonomy, feminism, or financial reasons. The author mentions she hasn't caused any mess except for her underwear, which she manages. The boyfriend is upset about potential stains and calls her gross, which could be judgmental. He's also brought in the roommate, which might be part of the conflict.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The author isn't doing anything that directly harms the boyfriend beyond his emotional discomfort. If she's clean and responsible, maybe his reaction is over the top. But he's concerned about living in the same space, so maybe there's a valid concern if there are accidents. However, the boyfriend's accusations of being a \"basic white girl feminist\" and calling her gross seem dismissive and derogatory, which is not respectful.\n\nThe roommate's involvement isn't clear, but the author's frustration is about her autonomy versus his discomfort. The boyfriend's reaction might stem from unhelpful attitudes about menstruation, which should be a private matter unless it affects others. Since she hasn't caused issues beyond her own management, his anger might be misplaced. The author getting mad could be justified if he's being unsupportive without valid reason. So, probably the boyfriend is in the wrong here, so the author isn't.\n"
