He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario involves free bleeding, which is a personal choice related to menstrual health. The author mentions they've been doing this for six months without staining anything except their underwear. The boyfriend is upset, calling them gross and not an adult because they don't buy tampons. He's worried about staining things, even though it hasn't happened. They're crying in the spare room, and he feels justified.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a valid choice for some people. It's a personal health decision and can be part of body autonomy. The author isn't causing harm beyond what they've already managed (no stains except underwear). The boyfriend's reaction seems to cross into judgment and control, especially since the behavior hasn't caused actual problems. His comments about being a \"basic white girl feminist\" and calling them disgusting might indicate shaming rather than a constructive conversation.\n\nThe roommate aspect is also a factor. If the boyfriend is a roommate, the author's choice could affect shared spaces. However, if the author hasn't caused any issues in those six months, the boyfriend's concerns might be overblown. The emotional response from the author\u2014crying and feeling isolated\u2014suggests that the boyfriend's reaction is hurtful and possibly disproportionate.\n\nBut, the boyfriend might have valid concerns about maintaining a clean living environment. However, the way he's handling it\u2014insulting and making them feel like the asshole\u2014might indicate the problem is more about his feelings than the actual situation. The key here is whether the author's choice is reasonable and if the boyfriend is overreacting.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to free bleed. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on judgment and not on actual harm. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
