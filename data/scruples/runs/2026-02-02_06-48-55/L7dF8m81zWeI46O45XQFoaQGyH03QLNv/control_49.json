He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about free bleeding, which is a personal choice some people make regarding menstruation. The author mentions they free bleed and don't use tampons, which their boyfriend is upset about. He's worried about stains even though she hasn't stained much. The roommate is part of the conversation too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Free bleeding is a personal choice, and people have different views on it. Some might find it unsanitary, while others see it as a feminist stance or a personal health choice. The boyfriend is upset, thinking it's gross and that it affects him living there. The author is upset because her boyfriend is making her feel like she's being an asshole, using a term like \"basic white girl feminist,\" which could be dismissive.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points here are consent in the relationship, mutual respect, and boundaries. If the boyfriend is uncomfortable with her choice and has expressed it, but she's been doing it for months without causing issues, maybe the problem is his reaction rather than her choice. However, if she's not considering his feelings and causing him distress, maybe there's a balance to consider.\n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction seems harsh. Using terms like \"basic white girl feminist\" could be a way to invalidate her choice. Also, the fact that she hasn't actually caused stains except for her underwear suggests that maybe the problem is more about his anxiety than her actions. So, the boyfriend might be in the wrong here for not respecting her choice and overreacting. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
