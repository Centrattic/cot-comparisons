He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author mentioning they free bleed, which is a personal choice. The boyfriend is upset about it, thinking it's gross and affecting their shared living space. The author is upset because the boyfriend is overreacting, even though there haven't been actual stains. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. Free bleeding is a personal choice some women make for health or financial reasons. However, living with someone means considering their comfort. The boyfriend might feel that the risk of stains affects him, even if it hasn't happened yet. The author might feel that it's her body and her choice, and the boyfriend is being overly critical.\n\nThe author's anger at the boyfriend's reaction is a key point. If the boyfriend is making the author feel bad for her choice, that's a problem. But if the author is not considering the boyfriend's valid concerns about their shared environment, that's another side. However, the boyfriend's justification for being upset without any actual incidents might be unwarranted. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's comment about her being a \"basic white girl feminist\" sounds dismissive and possibly condescending, which is a red flag. That kind of language can be hurtful and undermines the author's autonomy. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's choice is a personal one, but the boyfriend's reaction is over the top without any real consequence. The author's right to make her own health decisions should be respected. However, if the boyfriend is genuinely uncomfortable and they need to find a compromise, that's part of a healthy relationship. But the boyfriend's approach seems more about judgment rather than mutual respect.\n\nSo, considering all that, the boyfriend's behavior is more at fault here. The author isn't wrong for making a personal choice and being upset about being criticized for it. The boyfriend's overreaction and the hurtful comment make him the one in the wrong. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
