He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding, which is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and instead lets their blood flow freely. The author mentions doing this for six months without staining anything except their underwear. The boyfriend is upset, thinks it's gross, and the author is now in the spare room crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's choice to free bleed might be a personal health or feminist choice. They mention not wanting to spend money on tampons, which could be a financial decision. On the other hand, the boyfriend is worried about potential messes and feels the author isn't acting like an adult. The roommate might also be affected, as mentioned.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy versus shared living responsibilities. Free bleeding is a personal choice, but in a shared living space, there's an expectation to consider others. The author's behavior hasn't caused any actual mess beyond their underwear, so maybe there's an overreaction from the boyfriend. However, the boyfriend's concerns about potential messes affecting him and the roommate might be valid. The author's anger at the boyfriend for being upset could be seen as a reaction to his overreaction, but maybe the boyfriend is within his rights to express his concern.\n\nThe author is upset because the boyfriend called them a \"basic white girl feminist\" and \"disgusting,\" which is a personal attack. That might be where the boyfriend is in the wrong. The author isn't at fault for choosing to free bleed, especially if it's their body and their choice, unless it's affecting others. Since there's no actual mess except the underwear, maybe the boyfriend is being unreasonable. But if the author is in a shared space, maybe they should take steps to prevent any possible issues, like using a pad or being more careful. However, the author might not see it that way.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad. The boyfriend's reaction seems harsh and judgmental, calling them names. The author might be justified in feeling upset. The boyfriend's concern about potential messes is valid, but his response is not constructive. The author's choice isn't affecting others beyond their own perception, and if there's no actual problem, the boyfriend's reaction is unwarranted. So the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The boyfriend is overreacting and using personal attacks, which is the real issue here.\n"
