He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves free bleeding, which is a personal choice some people make for various reasons, like financial, environmental, or feminist ones. The author is upset that their boyfriend is criticizing them for it, even though they haven't caused any problems in six months. The boyfriend says they're gross and compares them to a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which is a bit of an insult.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Free bleeding is a matter of personal choice and body autonomy. The author isn't causing any harm, except maybe to the boyfriend's feelings. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about his own discomfort or fear of potential messes, but there's no actual issue beyond that. The author is upset because they feel their choice is being policed, and the boyfriend is using derogatory language, which is a red flag.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it affects him because he lives there might be about responsibility, but the author hasn't actually caused any problems. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own feelings rather than any real harm. Also, calling someone names and making them feel bad is not okay. The author's upset is about being judged for their choices, which is a valid concern. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend is overreacting and using insults, which is wrong. The author is standing up for their choice, which is a personal right. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
