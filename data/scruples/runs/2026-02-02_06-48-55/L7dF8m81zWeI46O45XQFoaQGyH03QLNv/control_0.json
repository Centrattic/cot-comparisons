I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario is about a person who free bleeds and their boyfriend is upset about it. The author is upset that their boyfriend is making them feel gross and not respecting their choice.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, it's when someone chooses not to use menstrual products like tampons or pads and lets their blood flow naturally. It's a personal choice, often related to body autonomy, environmental concerns, cost, or just preference. The author mentions they don't want to spend money on tampons, so that's one reason.\n\nNow, the boyfriend is upset because he's worried about potential stains and is calling the author gross. The author is upset that their choice is being policed and that their boyfriend isn't respecting their decision. They also mention that even after six months of free bleeding without incidents (except underwear), he's still stressed about it. The author is crying and feeling attacked.\n\nThe key points here are about personal choice and mutual respect in a relationship. The author isn't causing actual harm (no stains mentioned beyond underwear), and they have a right to make decisions about their own body. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his own discomfort or preferences, which might not justify dismissing the author's autonomy.\n\nHowever, there's a shared living space. If the boyfriend is genuinely concerned about possible accidents affecting his belongings, there's a need for communication. But the author hasn't caused any problems yet, so the boyfriend's reaction might be overblown. Also, the way he's framing it as the author being a \"basic white girl feminist\" and calling them gross is disrespectful and invalidates their choice.\n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's choices, even if you disagree, is important. The boyfriend isn't respecting the author's autonomy here, especially since the author's actions aren't causing actual issues. The author's anger at being criticized is a valid response to being disrespected.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to make personal health decisions, and the boyfriend isn't respecting that. The answer should be B (No).\n"
