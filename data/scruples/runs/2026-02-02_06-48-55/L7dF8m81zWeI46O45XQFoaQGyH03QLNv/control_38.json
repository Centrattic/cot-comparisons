He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discussing her choice to free bleed with her boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset about it, saying she's gross and acting like a child for not buying tampons. The author is upset because he's overreacting and calling her a \"basic white girl feminist.\" She's crying in the spare room.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, it's when someone chooses not to use menstrual products, letting the blood flow naturally. It's a personal choice, often made for reasons like sustainability, comfort, or as a form of activism against the stigma around menstruation. However, in shared living situations, it can be a point of contention if others feel uncomfortable or concerned about hygiene.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is that he's worried about stains and cleanliness, and he's upset she's not using products. He's calling her a feminist and implying she's being gross. The author is upset with his overreaction and the emotional response it's causing.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author's choice is her body and her right to manage it as she sees fit. However, in a shared living space, there might be practical concerns about hygiene and shared spaces. The boyfriend's concern about stains isn't entirely baseless, as menstrual blood can stain if not managed properly. But his reaction seems extreme\u2014he's calling her names, making her feel like an asshole, and she's crying. That's a significant emotional response.\n\nThe key points here: The author has been free bleeding for 6 months without incident (only staining her underwear). The boyfriend is still upset about potential future stains, which seems like an overreaction. He's also name-calling and not validating her feelings, which is poor communication. The author is standing up for her personal choice and is upset that he's dismissing her and making her feel bad. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Probably not. Her choice is personal and her method hasn't caused actual problems. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his discomfort and maybe deeper issues about boundaries or communication in the relationship. The fact that he's using terms like \"basic white girl feminist\" suggests he's not engaging in a respectful discussion but rather making a derogatory comment, which is on him.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
