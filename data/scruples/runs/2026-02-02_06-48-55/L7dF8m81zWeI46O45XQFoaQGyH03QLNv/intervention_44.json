He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding, which is a choice some people make regarding menstrual products. The author mentioned this casually while talking with her boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult, and he's worried about her bleeding on things. The author is upset because she hasn't stained anything except her underwear, but he's still angry, calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and disgusting. She ended up crying in the spare room.\n\nSo, the main points here are about personal choices, how others react to them, and whether the author is at fault. Free bleeding is a personal choice and can be a feminist stance for some, but it's a matter of personal hygiene and comfort. The boyfriend is upset about potential messes, but the author hasn't actually caused any stains beyond her underwear. He's projecting his worries onto her, which might be overreacting. However, the author mentioned this in a group setting (with her roommate), which might have been inappropriate if the roommate wasn't included in the conversation. But the main conflict is between her and her boyfriend.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems harsh and judgmental. Calling her names and using terms like \"basic white girl feminist\" is dismissive and possibly invalidating of her choice. The author is upset because her boyfriend is not supporting her choice and is instead criticizing her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad at his reaction.\n\nFrom a standpoint of personal freedom and autonomy, the author has the right to make her own choices about her body, even if others disagree. The boyfriend's reaction could be seen as controlling or disrespectful. However, if the free bleeding has caused actual issues (like messes), that's different, but the author says she hasn't stained anything else. The boyfriend's hypothetical worry might not be valid.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author brought up a topic that's sensitive in their household without considering the roommate's feelings, but the roommate's reaction isn't mentioned. The main issue is the boyfriend's overreaction. So, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to free bleed, nor for being upset by his judgmental response. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
