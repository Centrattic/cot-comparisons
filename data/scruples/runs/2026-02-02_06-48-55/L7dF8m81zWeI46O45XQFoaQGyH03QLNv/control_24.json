He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves free bleeding, which is a personal choice some people make for various reasons, including cost or personal preference.\n\nThe boyfriend is upset about it, thinking it's gross and that it affects him by potentially staining things. The AITA is upset because the boyfriend is overreacting and even called her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and said she's disgusting. The roommate is mentioned as being part of the conversation where the topic came up.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice. As long as it's not causing actual harm or mess, it's her body and her decision. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own discomfort or stigma around menstruation rather than any real issue. He's also bringing up financial aspects, but the AITA mentions she doesn't want to spend money on tampons, which is a valid reason if she chooses not to. \n\nThe boyfriend's accusation that she's being a \"basic white girl feminist\" is problematic because it's a dismissive and stereotyping comment. That's likely to be hurtful and not a valid reason to criticize her choice. Additionally, the AITA is upset because he's not respecting her personal choice and is instead judging her, which is a common issue in relationships when personal boundaries are crossed.\n\nThe roommate's presence in the conversation might not be the main issue here unless there's a problem with privacy, but the question focuses on the boyfriend's reaction. The AITA is crying and feeling isolated, which indicates emotional distress from the situation.\n\nLegally or socially, free bleeding is not wrong. The boyfriend's judgment and overreaction are more about personal discomfort rather than any objective wrong. The AITA isn't causing harm, so she's not in the wrong for standing up for her choice. The boyfriend's comments and actions are the issue here. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
