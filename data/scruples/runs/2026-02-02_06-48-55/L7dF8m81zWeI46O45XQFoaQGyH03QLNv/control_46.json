He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves free bleeding, which is when someone chooses to menstruate without using products like tampons or pads. The author is upset that their boyfriend is criticizing her for this, even though she hasn't caused any mess beyond her underwear. The boyfriend is concerned about potential stains and seems to think she's being gross and a bad feminist. The author is now in the spare room crying, feeling hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Free bleeding is a personal choice, and while some people might find it uncomfortable, it's a valid decision as long as it doesn't harm others. The author mentions she hasn't stained anything else, which suggests she's being careful. The boyfriend's reaction seems overly harsh, especially since the issue hasn't materialized beyond his fears. He's also attacking her motives, calling her a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which is a dismissive and possibly invalidating comment. The author is upset and feels insulted, which is a natural reaction to being criticized for a personal choice that doesn't negatively impact others.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might be coming from a place of genuine concern about cleanliness and shared living space. However, his approach\u2014insulting her and making her feel bad\u2014seems counterproductive. The fact that the author has been free bleeding for six months without issues indicates she's managing her choice responsibly. The boyfriend's reaction could stem from his own discomfort or lack of understanding rather than any real problem.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't violating any rules or harming others by free bleeding. Her boyfriend's criticism, especially the personal attacks, seem to be the larger issue here. The author's anger is a response to being insulted and devalued, which is understandable. The situation doesn't clearly show that the author is in the wrong; instead, it's more about the boyfriend's reaction being unwarranted and hurtful. So, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
