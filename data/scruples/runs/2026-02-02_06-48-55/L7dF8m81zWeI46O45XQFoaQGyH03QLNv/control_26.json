He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for free bleeding and causing a conflict with her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice some women make for various reasons\u2014health, cost, environmental, etc. The author mentions she hasn't stained anything except her underwear, and she's been doing it for six months. That suggests she's managing it without issues. \n\nThe boyfriend is upset about potential messes and calls her gross and a \"basic white girl feminist.\" His reaction seems more about his discomfort or lack of understanding rather than actual harm. The author is defensive, which is understandable if he's criticizing her choice. \n\nThe key points are: \n1. The author's choice is her right unless it's causing actual harm.\n2. The boyfriend's reaction is judgmental and dismissive of her reasons.\n3. The conflict arises from his disapproval rather than any real problem caused by her choice.\n\nThe roommate (boyfriend) is part of the household, but the author's free bleeding isn't affecting others beyond his perception. Since there's no evidence of actual mess or harm, his anger seems unfounded. The author's frustration at being criticized for her personal choice is valid. \n\nSo, the boyfriend's behavior is more at fault here. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for her choice.\n"
