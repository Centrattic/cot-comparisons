He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author mentioning that she free bleeds, which her boyfriend and roommate take issue with. The author is upset because her boyfriend is criticizing her for it, calling her gross and not an adult. She's also crying in the spare room, and he's defending his stance.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding means. From what I know, free bleeding is choosing not to use menstrual products, allowing blood to flow naturally. It's a personal choice, often linked to feminist or body autonomy reasons. However, it's important to consider how this affects shared living spaces and others' comfort levels.\n\nThe author says she's been doing this for six months without staining anything except her underwear. But her boyfriend is worried she'll stain things, even though it hasn't happened. The roommate and boyfriend are upset, and the boyfriend is calling her a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which is a derogatory term implying that she's doing it for attention or as a performative act.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, she's making a choice about her body that she's entitled to. Free bleeding is a personal decision, and it's her right to choose. However, if her choice affects the living environment, there's a balance to consider. The boyfriend and roommate might have a valid concern about hygiene and shared spaces. Even if she hasn't stained anything yet, the potential for it exists, and others might find it uncomfortable or unhygienic.\n\nBut the boyfriend's reaction seems extreme. Calling her gross and using a derogatory term suggests that his criticism is more about his own discomfort than a real issue. His reaction is dismissive of her autonomy and personal choice. The author's decision isn't affecting him in a tangible way beyond his emotional discomfort, which he's projecting as a problem with her.\n\nThe roommate's involvement isn't fully explained, but if they're also upset, it might be about shared living standards. However, the key issue is the boyfriend's overreaction. The author is justified in being upset if he's belittling her for a choice she's made. The fact that she's been doing it for six months without issues suggests she's managed it responsibly. His frustration seems to be more about his own anxiety than any real harm caused.\n\nSo, the boyfriend is in the wrong for his harsh reaction and invalidating her choice. The author isn't wrong for free bleeding, as it's her body and her choice. The boyfriend's criticism is based on his own discomfort and possibly outdated views on menstruation. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
