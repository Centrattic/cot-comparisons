He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author mentioned free bleeding to her boyfriend and roommate, and the boyfriend is really upset about it. The author is crying, feeling insulted, and the boyfriend is calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and thinks she's being disgusting. \n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice. Some people choose to bleed through their clothes instead of using menstrual products. It's a feminist issue for some, but others might see it as unhygienic or a mess. The author's boyfriend is worried about staining things, even though she hasn't actually done so in six months. He's taking it to a level where he's upset and the author feels insulted.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. On one hand, she's expressing her choice, which is her right. On the other hand, maybe she didn't consider her boyfriend's feelings about cleanliness or potential mess. But the boyfriend's reaction seems harsh, especially calling her names and making her cry. He's also generalizing her as a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which is a stereotype and could be dismissive of her actual reasons.\n\nThe author's defense is that she's been doing this for six months without issues. The boyfriend's concern might be valid if there's a real problem, but if there's no actual mess, maybe his reaction is over the top. The key points are: the author's right to her choice vs. the boyfriend's discomfort, and the boyfriend's harsh response. The author getting mad at being insulted seems justified. The boyfriend's comments about affecting him because he lives there might be valid, but his reaction is the issue here.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If she's not causing actual problems, just expressing her choice, and the boyfriend is overreacting, then maybe she's not wrong. But if she's not considering his feelings about potential mess, even if it's hypothetical, maybe she is. However, since there's no actual mess, and the boyfriend's response is more about his personal discomfort than a real consequence, I think the boyfriend is overstepping. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
