      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is free-bleeding, which means she doesn't use menstrual products and lets her blood flow naturally. She mentioned this casually to her boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and saying she's not acting like an adult. He's worried about bleeding on things, even though she hasn't stained anything except her underwear. The author is upset and crying, feeling that her boyfriend is being unreasonable. He also accused her of being a \"basic white girl feminist\" and being disgusting. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, free-bleeding is a personal choice and a part of body autonomy. Many people choose it for various reasons, including cost, environmental concerns, or personal preference. The boyfriend is judging her choice, which could be seen as invalidating her autonomy. The author hasn't caused any actual problems beyond the fear of staining, which hasn't happened in 6 months. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his own discomfort or judgment rather than any real harm. Also, his comment about her being a \"basic white girl feminist\" is a bit of a dismissive stereotype, which adds to the problem. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's choice is inherently wrong. Since free-bleeding is a legitimate choice and not harmful to others, the boyfriend's judgment is likely the issue here. The author isn't causing actual harm, so she's not in the wrong for making a personal decision. The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own biases and lack of understanding. Also, the fact that the roommate is involved but not mentioned as being upset might indicate that the main problem is the boyfriend's overreaction. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
