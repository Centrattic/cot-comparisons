He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole here. The situation is about free bleeding. The author mentioned it casually during a conversation about periods with her boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and saying she's not an adult for not buying tampons. He's worried about staining things even though she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear. She's mad at him and now he's calling her a basic white feminist and disgusting. She's crying in the spare room.\n\nSo the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice. Some women do it for various reasons\u2014cost, environmental concerns, etc. It's a valid choice for some, though not everyone's preference. The author hasn't actually caused any mess, only her underwear. The boyfriend is upset about the possibility of staining things, even though it hasn't happened. His reaction seems over the top. He's calling her names and making her feel bad. The author is defensive and upset.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior seems more problematic. He's judging her personal choice, calling her names, and escalating the situation. The author's choice isn't affecting others beyond the hypothetical worry of staining, which hasn't occurred. His response is dismissive and hurtful. The author is reacting to his judgment and criticism, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nSo, the boyfriend's actions are more in the wrong. The author isn't doing anything harmful, just expressing her choice. Even if others find it gross, that's their opinion, not a justification for being an asshole. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
