He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person (the author) discussing their choice to free bleed, which is when someone chooses to let menstrual blood flow naturally without using products like tampons or pads. The boyfriend is upset about it, saying they're gross and not an adult for not buying tampons. The author is upset and crying, feeling insulted.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what free bleeding entails. It's a personal choice related to body autonomy and can be a feminist stance for some people. However, it's important to consider the living situation. The author lives with their boyfriend and a roommate. The boyfriend is worried about potential stains and is upset, which might be about cleanliness or shared living space. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for being upset with their boyfriend's reaction. On one hand, free bleeding is a personal choice, and the author has the right to make decisions about their own body. The boyfriend's criticism, calling them a \"basic white girl feminist\" and \"disgusting,\" seems like an attack on their personal choice and identity, which could be seen as invalidating. That's probably not okay.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is bleeding on shared spaces, maybe there are practical concerns about hygiene and shared living. However, the author mentions that in six months, they've only stained their underwear, implying they take care to avoid staining others' belongings. The boyfriend is still upset about the potential, not the actual occurrence. That seems like overreacting.\n\nThe boyfriend's response is dismissive and judgmental, which could be the real issue here. The author is standing up for their choice, which is their right. The boyfriend's insults and the situation leading to the author crying suggests he's in the wrong. So the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
