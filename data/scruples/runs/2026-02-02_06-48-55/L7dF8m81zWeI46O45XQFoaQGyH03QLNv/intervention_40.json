He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author free-bleeding, which is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets their blood flow naturally. The boyfriend is upset about this, saying it's gross and that he's worried about staining things. The roommate is also involved in the conversation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand free-bleeding. It's a personal choice some women make for various reasons\u2014health, environmental, or financial. The author mentions they don't want to spend money on tampons, which could be a valid reason. However, the boyfriend is upset because he's worried about the mess. The key here is whether the author's actions are affecting the shared living space negatively.\n\nThe author says they haven't stained anything except their underwear, which might mean their free-bleeding isn't causing a mess in the common areas. But the boyfriend is still upset, possibly because of the potential future mess or the perceived uncleanliness. The author is getting mad at him for being upset. The boyfriend accuses her of being a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which is a stereotype and possibly a way to dismiss her choice.\n\nNow, considering the roommate situation, the author's choice might affect the shared living space. If the author is not taking steps to avoid staining anything else, then maybe the boyfriend has a valid concern. On the other hand, free-bleeding is a personal choice and shouldn't be criticized unless it's causing actual problems. The author hasn't caused any stains in months except their underwear, so maybe the boyfriend is overreacting. But the author is also getting angry at his concern, which could be seen as dismissive of his feelings.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the free-bleeding isn't causing any issues beyond their underwear, then the boyfriend's reaction might be unwarranted. However, if the author is ignoring the potential for future problems or isn't considering their partner's feelings, maybe they're in the wrong. It's a balance between personal choice and respecting shared living space. The author is upset about being called gross and a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which is a stereotype, so the boyfriend's approach might be invalid. However, the author could also be dismissive of his concerns. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the author's choice is their right, but they might need to communicate better with the boyfriend to address his concerns without being defensive. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but they could improve communication.\n"
