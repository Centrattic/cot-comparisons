I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author talking about free-bleeding with her boyfriend and roommate. Free-bleeding is when someone allows menstrual blood to flow out naturally without using products like tampons or pads. The boyfriend is upset about it, thinking it's gross and a financial issue. The author is upset because he's criticizing her and she's now in the spare room crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author mentions they've been free-bleeding for six months without staining anything except her underwear. The boyfriend is worried about potential stains and calls her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and says she's being gross. The author is mad at him for this reaction.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, free-bleeding is a personal choice that some people make for various reasons, including financial, environmental, or personal comfort. It's not illegal or a health hazard if done properly. The boyfriend's criticism seems to be based on his discomfort or his perception of cleanliness. However, the author hasn't caused actual problems (no stains beyond her underwear), so his concerns might be overblown. \n\nThe boyfriend's comments about her being a \"basic white girl feminist\" suggest he's dismissing her reasons for free-bleeding, possibly invalidating her choices. That's a problematic way to address disagreements. The author's frustration stems from being criticized for a personal choice that's not affecting others directly, aside from his emotional reaction. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't causing harm beyond what she's already managed (no stains). The boyfriend's reaction is more about his own discomfort rather than a valid health or safety issue. Therefore, the boyfriend might be the one in the wrong for overreacting and making personal attacks. The author's anger in this situation is a reasonable response to being criticized for a choice that's her body and her way of managing it, provided it's done respectfully and without affecting others. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B), as her actions are her personal choice and her boyfriend's reaction is more about his own issues rather than a justified concern about harm or mess.\n"
