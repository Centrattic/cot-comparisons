He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about free bleeding, which the author mentions casually to her boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, thinking she's gross and not acting like an adult because she doesn't buy tampons. She's been free bleeding for six months without staining anything except her underwear. He's worried about stains and she's upset because he's making her feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, it's when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets menstrual blood flow naturally. It's a personal choice, and some people do it for reasons like environmental concerns, cost, or body autonomy. But there might be practical issues, like hygiene or comfort in shared spaces.\n\nThe boyfriend is concerned about potential stains and seems to be upset about the lifestyle choice. The author is upset because he's judging her and calling her a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which seems like an attack on her identity. The roommate might be involved too, but the main conflict is between the author and her boyfriend.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, free bleeding is a personal choice. If she's not causing actual problems (like staining shared items), maybe she's not wrong. The boyfriend might be overreacting, especially since there haven't been any issues in six months. But he has a valid concern about living together and potential messes. However, his reaction seems harsh, judging her and making her feel bad. The author's anger could be justified if she feels disrespected. The term \"basic white girl feminist\" is a stereotype and could be offensive. \n\nOn the other hand, if free bleeding is causing any kind of disruption or if it's against their shared living agreements, maybe the author should consider that. But the problem states she hasn't stained anything except her underwear, so maybe there's no real issue. The boyfriend's reaction might be based on his own discomfort or misunderstanding. \n\nIt's a conflict between personal choice and shared living space. The boyfriend's approach might not be the best\u2014maybe he should communicate his concerns without shaming her. The author has the right to make her own health decisions, even if they're different from his preferences. But they need to find a compromise. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since she's not causing actual problems and he's being judgmental, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
