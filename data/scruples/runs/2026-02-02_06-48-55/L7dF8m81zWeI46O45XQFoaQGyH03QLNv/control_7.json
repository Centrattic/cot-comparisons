He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for free bleeding and getting upset when their boyfriend reacts negatively. Free bleeding is a personal choice where some people choose not to use menstrual products, which can be a feminist stance for some. The boyfriend is upset about the potential for staining and thinks she's being gross or childish because she's not using tampons to avoid expense. \n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal decision and not inherently wrong. People have different reasons\u2014health, cost, personal preference. The fact that she's been doing it for months without issues except her underwear suggests she's managing it responsibly. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his discomfort or fear of mess, but that doesn't necessarily make her wrong. \n\nHe's calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" which is a derogatory label, implying her choice is performative or trivial. That's a judgmental and dismissive attitude. His reaction seems more about his own preferences and maybe a lack of understanding of her choice rather than a valid health or safety concern. \n\nThe author is upset because he's invalidating her choice and making her feel bad. She's in a shared living space, so there's a balance between her personal habits and his comfort. However, unless there's a legitimate hygiene issue or disregard for shared spaces (which isn't indicated here besides underwear), her choice isn't affecting him beyond his own anxiety about possible staining. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it affects him because he lives there seems weak if she's not actually causing problems. It's possible he's projecting his discomfort onto her. The key here is whether her actions are genuinely harmful. Since she hasn't stained anything beyond her underwear, his concerns might be exaggerated. \n\nThe emotional response from the author is understandable given the criticism and the label he used. Being called an asshole or a bad feminist for a personal health choice is unfair. So, the boyfriend's reaction is more about his own issues rather than her being wrong. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's judgment and the way he's dismissing her choice without valid reasons makes him the asshole. The answer should be B.\n"
