He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about free bleeding. The user mentions they free bleed, which means they don't use menstrual products like tampons or pads and instead let their blood flow out naturally. They were talking about periods with their boyfriend and roommate, and the boyfriend is upset about it. He's called them gross and not acting like an adult because they don't buy tampons. He's worried about staining stuff, even though they haven't stained anything except their underwear. The author is upset and crying in the spare room, feeling insulted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Free bleeding is a personal choice some people make for various reasons\u2014maybe financial, environmental, or as a form of protest or bodily autonomy. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about cleanliness and being upset that they might stain things. The author argues that they haven't actually caused any mess beyond their underwear. But the boyfriend is still upset about the potential and calls them a \"basic white girl feminist\" and \"disgusting.\"\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they're in their home, and they're making a personal choice. But maybe the boyfriend has valid concerns if he lives there too. However, the way he's reacting seems harsh. Calling someone gross and implying they're not acting like an adult could be disrespectful. The author might feel their choice is being dismissed. But on the other hand, if they're free bleeding, there's a chance of mess, even if it hasn't happened yet. The boyfriend might be overreacting, but maybe he's not comfortable with it.\n\nThe key points are consent and mutual respect. The author's choice is their own, but they need to consider the roommate's feelings. However, the boyfriend's response seems to be more about judgment than actual cleanliness issues. He's using insults, which is not healthy. The author's being upset is understandable if their partner is belittling them. So, maybe the boyfriend is the real asshole here. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset when someone insults them. But some might argue that they should have considered the roommate's feelings more. But the main issue is his reaction being harsh and disrespectful.\n\nHmm. So if the answer is A (author is wrong), that would mean the author is at fault. But if it's B (not wrong), then the author isn't. Given the information, I think B makes sense because the author's choice is personal and the boyfriend's reaction is inappropriate. The author isn't in the wrong for being mad at his insults.\n"
