He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person askingAITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a woman free bleeding, which is when someone doesn't use menstrual products and lets their blood flow freely. She mentions this casually to her boyfriend and roommate, and now her boyfriend is upset. He's upset because he's worried she'll stain things, even though she hasn't in the past six months. He's called her gross and said she's acting like a basic white girl feminist. She's mad at him and is crying in the spare room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Free bleeding is a personal choice related to body autonomy. The author has the right to choose her method of menstrual management. However, living with someone else does require consideration of their feelings. If she's free bleeding, there might be practical concerns like blood getting on shared spaces. But she says she hasn't stained anything except her underwear, so maybe the boyfriend's concerns are exaggerated or not based on actual incidents.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems harsh. Calling her gross and implying she's being childish might be unwarranted. He's also bringing up financial reasons, saying she's saving money by not buying tampons. That's a personal choice, and unless there's a shared financial responsibility (like splitting costs for household items), it's her decision. However, if the free bleeding is causing a mess that affects him (like blood on floors, furniture), then maybe he has a point. But the author says it hasn't happened in six months, so maybe his fears aren't based on reality.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction to the boyfriend's criticism could be seen as defensive. She's upset and isolating herself, which might be due to feeling attacked. The boyfriend's comparison to \"basic white girl feminism\" is a problematic stereotype and could be dismissive of her valid concerns about bodily autonomy. That part of his response is definitely unhelpful and disrespectful.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She made a personal choice that's within her rights, but perhaps she didn't consider her boyfriend's feelings enough. However, his reaction is also extreme and disrespectful. The question is whether she's in the wrong for being upset. Since she's defending her choice and he's attacking her, it's more about his behavior being the issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
