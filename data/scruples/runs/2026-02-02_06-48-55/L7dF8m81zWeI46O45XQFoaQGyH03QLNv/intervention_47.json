I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who free bleeds, was talking about periods with her boyfriend and their roommate. She mentioned free bleeding casually, and now her boyfriend is upset, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult by not using tampons. He's worried about her staining things, even though she hasn't in six months. She's mad at him and feels he's not supportive, and he's called her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and \"disgusting.\" She's crying in the spare room.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice where some women choose to bleed without using products like tampons or pads. It's often a feminist stance or about personal comfort. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be a mix of concern for hygiene and maybe discomfort with the practice. He's worried about stains, even if none have happened, and is bringing up the cost of tampons as a reason she's not an adult. But the author doesn't want to spend money on them, which could be a financial decision or a matter of preference.\n\nThe key points here are: 1. Whether free bleeding is a valid choice and 2. If the boyfriend's reaction is reasonable or if the author is justified in being upset. From the information given, the author hasn't actually caused a mess, so the boyfriend's concern might be unfounded. His judgment about her being gross and his dismissive comments (\"basic white girl feminist\") could be seen as invalidating her choices and possibly making her feel attacked. \n\nFinancial responsibility is part of adulthood, but choosing not to use tampons isn't necessarily about that. It's more about personal choice and body autonomy. If the boyfriend is using the cost as a reason to criticize her, that's not really supporting her choice. Also, the fact that he's bringing up the roommate and the living environment makes me think he's projecting his discomfort onto the situation, even if there's no evidence she's made a mess. \n\nThe author's anger is a natural response to being insulted and criticized for a personal decision that hasn't caused actual problems. The boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own feelings or societal discomfort rather than addressing real issues. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. She has the right to make her own health and lifestyle choices, and her boyfriend should respect that. His comments come off as judgmental and dismissive, which isn't acceptable. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
