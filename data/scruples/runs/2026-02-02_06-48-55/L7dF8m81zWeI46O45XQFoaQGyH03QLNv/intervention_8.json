He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a person who free bleeds and their boyfriend being upset about it. The author mentions that they've been free bleeding for six months without actually staining anything except their underwear, but the boyfriend is really worked up about the possibility of staining things. The boyfriend is also calling the author a \"basic white girl feminist\" and saying they're disgusting. The author is upset and feeling insulted.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what free bleeding entails. Free bleeding is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products like tampons or pads, allowing blood to flow naturally. People choose this for various reasons, including cost, environmental concerns, or as a personal choice. It's a valid choice, though it can be controversial.\n\nThe boyfriend's main issue seems to be the potential for staining things, even though the author hasn't done so except for their underwear. He's also making personal attacks, which is problematic. The author is getting mad because they feel insulted by his comments. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being mad.\n\nSo, considering the boyfriend's reaction: he's not just concerned about practical matters but is also attacking the author's character and choices, calling them names and questioning their feminism. That's not a respectful response. The author's choice to free bleed is their personal decision, and while it might not be the boyfriend's preference, it's a valid choice. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his own discomfort or societal norms rather than any real harm caused. The author hasn't actually caused any mess beyond their underwear, so the boyfriend's anger seems excessive and misplaced.\n\nThe key points here are respect for personal choices, the validity of free bleeding as a practice, and the boyfriend's inappropriate reaction. The author is not in the wrong for being upset by the boyfriend's disrespectful comments. The boyfriend's behavior is more at fault here. So the answer should be B, that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
