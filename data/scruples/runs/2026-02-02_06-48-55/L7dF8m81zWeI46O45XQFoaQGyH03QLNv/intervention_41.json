He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe author is talking about free bleeding with her boyfriend and roommate. She mentions it casually while discussing periods. The boyfriend is upset, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult because she doesn't buy tampons. He's worried about staining things, even though she hasn't stained anything except her underwear. She's mad at him, and he accuses her of being a \"basic white girl feminist\" and disgusting. She's now crying in the spare room.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. Free bleeding is a personal choice some women make for various reasons\u2014health, cost, environmental, etc. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about cleanliness and potential mess, even though the author hasn't actually caused any issues beyond her underwear. But he's worked up about it. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? The author isn't hurting anyone else, just making a choice that's her body. The boyfriend is projecting his discomfort onto her, maybe without understanding her reasons. But she's getting angry because he's upset, which could be a communication issue. However, the boyfriend's accusation that she's being gross and a feminist term seems judgmental and dismissive. \n\nThe key here is mutual respect. The author's choice is valid, and the boyfriend shouldn't shame her for it. However, if they live together, there might be a need for compromise. But the boyfriend's reaction seems more about his own discomfort and not respecting her autonomy. The author's anger is a response to being criticized for her personal choice. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not. The boyfriend is not respecting her choice and making her feel bad about it. The author's choice to free bleed isn't affecting others beyond her underwear, so the boyfriend's anger seems misplaced. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
