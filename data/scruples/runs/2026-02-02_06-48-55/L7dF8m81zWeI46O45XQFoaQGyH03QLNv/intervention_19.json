He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discussing their choice to free bleed, which is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and instead let their blood flow freely, using only a cloth or nothing. The boyfriend is upset about it, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult, and the author is upset with him for overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that she's been doing this for six months without staining anything except her underwear, which suggests she's taking precautions. She's upset that her boyfriend is making a big deal out of it, calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and being judgmental. She's also crying and in the spare room, indicating emotional distress.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is concerned about potential messes and seems to be upset about the hygiene aspect. He might be worried about cleanliness in their shared living space. The key points here are personal choice versus shared living responsibilities.\n\nFree bleeding is a personal choice related to bodily autonomy and can be a feminist stance for some women. However, in a shared living situation, there's an expectation of considering others' comfort. The author is not causing actual damage beyond her underwear, but the boyfriend's feelings are hurt. Is her choice crossing a line into affecting others negatively?\n\nThe author argues she's not causing issues, but the boyfriend feels it's affecting him. The question is whether her actions are reasonable in a shared space. If she's managing her menstrual blood in a way that doesn't affect him (no stains on common areas), then maybe his reaction is overblown. However, if the mere practice of free bleeding is making him uncomfortable, there's a conflict in their living arrangements.\n\nThe boyfriend's comment about \"basic white girl feminist\" might be a derogatory term implying that her feminism is performative or naive. This could be a point where he's invalidating her personal choice, which is a problem. His justification for being angry might be based on personal discomfort rather than actual harm caused by her actions.\n\nThe author getting mad at him for being judgmental and for using that term is understandable. However, the core issue is whether her choice is reasonable. Since she's not causing actual messes beyond her own belongings, her right to choose her menstrual management method is valid. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his own discomfort rather than a legitimate issue.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to free bleed, especially if she's not affecting the living space. The boyfriend's overreaction and derogatory comments are problematic. The answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
