      "text": "Okay, let's try to understand this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author mentioning that she free bleeds, which means she doesn't use menstrual products and allows her blood to flow freely. Her boyfriend is upset about this, saying she's gross and not an adult because she doesn't spend money on tampons. He's worried she'll stain things, even though she hasn't actually done so in the past six months. The author is upset and feels he's being unjustified, leading to her crying in the spare room with the cats.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of free bleeding. It's a personal choice for some women, often related to feminist or body autonomy reasons. The author isn't harming anyone else, as per her statement\u2014she hasn't stained anything except her underwear. The boyfriend's concern seems to be about potential mess and hygiene, but the author is maintaining her own boundaries by handling her own hygiene through her underwear. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend lives in the same place, so he might have valid concerns about shared spaces. Even if the author hasn't stained anything yet, his anxiety about it could be a legitimate issue. But is his reaction reasonable? Insisting that free bleeding is gross and implying it's affecting him (maybe through stress or the idea of possible mess) could be seen as overreacting, especially if she's been doing it for six months without issues. He's calling her a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which might be a dismissive or derogatory way to invalidate her choice. That seems like a problem.\n\nThe author's reaction to being called gross and told she's not acting like an adult is understandable. Feeling insulted and needing to retreat to another room suggests he's being disrespectful. The key here is mutual respect. While the boyfriend has a right to express discomfort, his approach seems to be shaming her for her choice and not respecting her autonomy. The author's choice to free bleed is hers to make, as long as it doesn't directly affect him in a harmful way. Since there's no evidence of actual mess or harm, his reaction might be more about personal discomfort than a justified issue.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the boyfriend's behavior might be more at fault here. The author is within her rights to make her own health and body choices. However, there might be room for dialogue to address his concerns without shaming her. If the author's free bleeding isn't causing actual problems, then she's not wrong for choosing that method. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
