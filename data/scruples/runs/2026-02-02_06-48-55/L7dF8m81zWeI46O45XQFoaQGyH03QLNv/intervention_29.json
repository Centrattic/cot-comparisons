He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding, which is a practice where someone doesn't use menstrual products and allows blood to flow naturally. The author mentions doing this casually in a conversation with her boyfriend and roommate, and now the boyfriend is upset, calling her gross and not an adult because she doesn't buy tampons. The author is upset and crying, feeling insulted, and the boyfriend is angry about the possibility of staining things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Free bleeding is a personal choice and can be a feminist stance for some. The author has been doing it for six months without causing a problem except for her underwear. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about potential messes and his discomfort. But why is he so upset? Is it about actual cleanliness, or is there some underlying issue?\n\nThe author is upset because her boyfriend is criticizing her choice and using derogatory terms, calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and saying she's disgusting. That's pretty harsh. His comments might be dismissive of her autonomy and her reasons for free bleeding. On the other hand, he's living in the same space, so he might have valid concerns about cleanliness and shared living areas. However, if she hasn't actually caused any issues beyond her own underwear, maybe his reaction is overblown. \n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The boyfriend is making her feel bad about her personal health choices, which are her right. Even if he's uncomfortable, he shouldn't invalidate her choices with insults. Free bleeding is a personal decision, and unless it's causing actual harm or problems, it's her body and her choice. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his own discomfort and perhaps a lack of understanding or respect for her autonomy. \n\nAlso, the fact that she hasn't stained anything except her underwear suggests that she's managing it in a way that doesn't affect others. The boyfriend's anger might be about potential future issues rather than current ones, which could be an overreaction. His use of derogatory language and making her feel guilty for her choice is problematic. \n\nIn terms of shared living, if there's a conflict like this, communication is key. But in this case, the boyfriend is not just expressing concern; he's attacking her with insults. That's more about disrespect than a legitimate concern. The author is justified in being upset because her autonomy is being criticized, and she has the right to make choices about her own body without being called gross or dismissed as an adult. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the boyfriend is in the wrong for his harsh reaction and invalidating her choices, even if he has some concerns about cleanliness. The author isn't at fault here. She's making a personal choice that doesn't harm others, and his response is disrespectful and dismissive.\n"
