He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author mentions free bleeding in front of her boyfriend and roommate, and the boyfriend is upset about it. The author is upset because he's criticizing her and calling her gross and not an adult. She's been doing this for 6 months without staining anything except her underwear, but he's still worked up. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, it's when someone chooses not to use menstrual products like tampons or pads, letting their blood flow naturally. It's a personal choice and part of body autonomy for some people. However, if it affects others living in the same space, that could be a point of conflict.\n\nThe boyfriend is upset because he's worried about staining things. The author says she hasn't stained anything except her underwear, but he's still angry. He accuses her of being gross and a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which might be an insult implying her stance is performative or not serious. She's upset and crying, feeling justified in her anger.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. On one hand, her choice to free bleed is her right, and she's not causing actual harm beyond her underwear. On the other hand, if she's doing this in shared spaces where others might be disturbed, maybe there's a consideration for others' comfort. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems excessive if there's no actual mess. He's projecting his anxiety onto her, maybe not respecting her autonomy. The roommate is mentioned but doesn't seem to have an issue, so the main conflict is with the boyfriend.\n\nThe key points are: free bleeding is a personal choice, but living with someone might require some compromise. However, since she hasn't caused any issues beyond her own underwear, the boyfriend's reaction might be unwarranted. He's attacking her character and calling her names, which is more about his own discomfort than actual problems. She's standing up for her choice, which is valid. So maybe the boyfriend is in the wrong here, meaning the author isn't. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. If there's a shared responsibility to clean up or avoid making others uncomfortable, even if it's just a perception, maybe she could adjust. But if she's not actually causing issues, it's his reaction that's the problem. So I think the answer is B.\n"
