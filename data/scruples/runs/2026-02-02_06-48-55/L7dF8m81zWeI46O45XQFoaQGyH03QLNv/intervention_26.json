I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. So, the user is asking whether the person (the author of the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about free bleeding, which is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets the blood flow out naturally. The author talks about this casually with her boyfriend and roommate, and now the boyfriend is upset, saying she's gross and acting like a child. The author is upset because she doesn't see it as a problem, especially since she hasn't stained anything except her underwear. The boyfriend is worried she might bleed on other things, even though it hasn't happened in six months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is free bleeding for her own reasons, which might be personal choice, cost, or environmental. She's been doing it for six months without issues. The boyfriend is upset about the potential mess and maybe discomfort. But the author feels he's overreacting and being judgmental. The boyfriend accuses her of being a \"basic white girl feminist\" and calls her actions disgusting, which is pretty harsh. The author is now upset and feels he's justified in his anger.\n\nNow, the key points are: Is free bleeding inherently inappropriate or unhygienic? The author hasn't had any issues except her underwear, which is expected. The boyfriend's main issue is the potential for accidents, but there haven't been any. Is it reasonable for the boyfriend to be so upset? Maybe if they live together, there's a shared responsibility for the living environment. However, the boyfriend's reaction seems excessive and judgmental, especially using terms like \"gross\" and \"disgusting.\" Also, calling someone a \"basic white girl feminist\" is a stereotype and could be seen as offensive.\n\nThe author's actions themselves may not be wrong if she's managing her hygiene properly. The problem here might be the boyfriend's inability to accept her choices, leading to conflict. The author's anger at being judged and labeled might be justified. However, maybe the author should have considered her boyfriend's comfort before discussing it so casually. But the boyfriend's response seems overly harsh, especially given the time span of six months without issues.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior seems more problematic\u2014using harsh language and making judgments. The author's free bleeding is her choice, and unless it's causing actual problems, it's her body. Therefore, the boyfriend might be the one at fault here. The author isn't wrong for defending her choice and being upset by his reaction. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
