He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is about a person who free bleeds and their boyfriend being upset about it. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, free bleeding is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products like tampons or pads, allowing blood to flow naturally. It's a personal choice, often related to environmental concerns, cost, or personal freedom. So, the author is probably making a personal choice here.\n\nThe boyfriend is upset because he thinks it's gross and that she's being irresponsible by not spending money on tampons. He's worried about potential stains, even though she hasn't had any in six months. He's also called her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and said she's disgusting, which sounds pretty harsh and possibly offensive.\n\nThe author is now in the spare room crying, feeling hurt by his reaction. The question is whether she's in the wrong for being upset by his response.\n\nSo, considering personal autonomy: the right to make decisions about one's own body is a significant aspect. If she's an adult and this is her choice, others might not have the right to judge her for it. However, living with someone else might involve some compromises. If her free bleeding is affecting the shared living space, the boyfriend might have valid concerns. But in this case, she says she hasn't stained anything except her underwear, so maybe his worries are exaggerated.\n\nThe boyfriend's response seems to go beyond concern. Insulting her and making derogatory comments could be seen as disrespectful. Even if he's worried about cleanliness, the way he's expressing it is problematic. The fact that he's dismissing her as a \"basic white girl feminist\" suggests a possible underlying issue, maybe with her feminist views, which isn't a valid reason to criticize her personal choices.\n\nOn the other hand, if they live together, there should be mutual respect for each other's habits. If the boyfriend is genuinely uncomfortable with the possibility of stains, maybe a conversation about boundaries would be better. But the boyfriend's approach here is more about judgment and name-calling, which is not constructive.\n\nThe author is mad because he's insulted her and made her feel bad. It's reasonable for her to be upset if someone is being disrespectful towards her personal choices. Therefore, the boyfriend's actions might be the issue here, not the author's decision to free bleed.\n\nSo putting it all together: the author isn't in the wrong for being upset by her boyfriend's judgmental and insulting remarks. Her choice to free bleed is her own, and his reaction is more about his own discomfort and possibly prejudice rather than a legitimate concern about cleanliness, given that there haven't been any actual problems. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
