He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discussing free bleeding with her boyfriend and roommate. She's upset because her boyfriend is upset about it, and he's even called her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and said she's gross. She's now in the spare room crying.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, free bleeding is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets their blood flow freely. It's a personal choice related to body autonomy, but it can be a sensitive topic, especially in shared living spaces.\n\nThe author mentions that she's been doing this for 6 months without staining anything except her underwear. So, maybe she's not making a mess. However, her boyfriend is concerned about potential stains and is upset. The roommate isn't mentioned as being upset, so maybe that's not an issue.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems harsh. Insulting her and calling her names like \"disgusting\" isn't helpful. It's possible that his reaction stems from a place of discomfort or a different cultural upbringing, but the way he's handling it is toxic. The author is getting upset because he's invalidating her choice and making her feel like she's in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Free bleeding is a personal choice and a matter of body autonomy. 2) The boyfriend's reaction is emotionally abusive and not constructive. 3) The author is being defensive because her choice is being criticized. 4) The roommate isn't mentioned as being upset, so maybe the issue is between her and her boyfriend.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be wrong, but I need to consider the dynamics. The boyfriend's behavior is more problematic here. The author isn't acting inconsiderate if she's not causing actual issues. The boyfriend's reaction is disproportionate and using emotional manipulation. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset with his reaction. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
