He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discussing free-bleeding with their boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset about it, calling her gross and a basic white feminist, while she's upset because she's not staining anything and doesn't want to spend money on tampons. The user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand free-bleeding. From what I know, it's a menstrual health practice where people choose not to use period products like tampons or pads, often for environmental, financial, or personal reasons. It's a valid choice, though it can be uncomfortable or risky if not done properly, like wearing dark clothes and using a menstrual cup or being careful with laundry.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to stem from concern about mess and potential stains. He's worried about the cleanliness of their shared living space. The author mentions she hasn't stained anything except her underwear in six months. That suggests she's been careful, but he's still upset. His comments about her being gross and using the term \"basic white girl feminist\" seem dismissive and possibly condescending. That's a problem because he's not respecting her choice and is making personal attacks.\n\nThe author is getting mad at him for his attitude. She feels he's overreacting, especially since there's no evidence of actual problems beyond his fears. She's also emotional, being in the spare room crying. The roommate isn't mentioned as being upset, so maybe the boyfriend is the main issue here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: her choice to free-bleed is a personal decision, she's been careful to avoid stains, and he's not respecting her choice with his insults. On the other hand, he's concerned about shared living space and potential messes. But his reaction seems extreme and judgmental. The term \"basic white girl feminist\" implies he's stereotyping her, which is not okay.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The author isn't causing actual harm beyond his worries, while the boyfriend is being disrespectful and attacking her character. So, the boyfriend's behavior is more problematic here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. She has a right to make her own health choices, and his reaction is the issue. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
