He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discussing free bleeding with her boyfriend and roommate. Free bleeding is when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and allows blood to flow freely, which can be a personal choice related to body autonomy or cost.\n\nThe boyfriend is upset because he's worried about possible stains and feels that the author is being gross and not acting like an adult. The author feels insulted and is crying, while the boyfriend frames it as a cleanliness and shared living space issue. The key points here are personal choice, shared living responsibilities, and mutual respect.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a valid personal choice for many people, often rooted in feminist principles or financial constraints. However, in a shared living situation, it's reasonable for housemates to have some discussion about cleanliness and avoiding damage to shared spaces. The author mentions she's been doing this for six months without staining anything except her underwear, which suggests she's taking some precautions.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on fear of stains and possibly discomfort with the practice. He's labeling her as \"gross\" and \"basic white girl feminist,\" which might indicate a lack of understanding or respect for her choice. On the other hand, the author might not have considered how her actions affect others in the household, even if her intent is personal and hygienic for her.\n\nThe author is upset because her choice is being criticized, which is a matter of personal autonomy. However, in a shared living space, there's a balance between personal freedom and the comfort of others. If free bleeding were causing actual problems, that would be different, but the user says there haven't been issues beyond her underwear.\n\nThe boyfriend's response seems harsh and dismissive, using judgmental language that could be hurtful. The author's reaction of being upset is understandable if she feels her autonomy is being attacked. It's possible neither is entirely \"in the wrong,\" but the boyfriend's approach is more disrespectful. The situation might require communication about boundaries and mutual respect rather than assigning blame.\n\nConsidering these factors, the answer is likely that the author is not in the wrong because her choice is personal and hasn't caused harm, while the boyfriend's response is more about his discomfort and lack of respect for her autonomy. However, there's room for both to communicate better.\n"
