He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author talking casually about free bleeding with her boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend reacted negatively, saying she's gross and not an adult for not using tampons. The author is upset and crying, and the boyfriend is upset about possible stains, even though she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, it's a choice where individuals choose not to use menstrual products and instead let blood flow naturally. It's often discussed in feminist contexts as a rejection of commercialization and a personal choice about the body. However, the boyfriend is upset about the possibility of staining things, even though there's been no actual problem in six months. \n\nThe author mentions that the boyfriend called her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and called her disgusting. That seems like a personal attack, which is not okay. The boyfriend's reaction might be based on his own discomfort or societal norms, but dismissing her choice and attacking her character is problematic.\n\nThe author is getting mad at the boyfriend for his reaction. Is her anger justified? Well, she made a personal choice, and while the boyfriend might have concerns about hygiene or cleanliness, he's overreacting by attacking her and making her feel bad. The fact that she hasn't actually caused any issues (except for her underwear) suggests that the problem is more about his perception rather than any real mess.\n\nThe boyfriend is also making the situation worse by not respecting her choice and escalating the conflict. The author is in her home and has the right to make personal decisions unless they directly affect others. Since the free bleeding hasn't caused issues beyond her underwear, which is her responsibility, the boyfriend's reaction seems unwarranted.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I think the boyfriend is the one at fault here. The author is standing by her choice, which is a personal decision, and the boyfriend's response is hostile and dismissive. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset.\n"
