He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about free bleeding and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nFirst, free bleeding is a personal choice some women make for various reasons like cost, environmental concerns, or personal preference. The author mentions she hasn't stained anything except her underwear, which suggests she's been careful. The boyfriend seems upset about the potential mess and even calls her gross and a \"basic white girl feminist.\" That sounds like a pretty harsh judgment of her choice.\n\nThe key points here are about personal autonomy versus shared living spaces. While the boyfriend has a right to be concerned about cleanliness, the author's choice is a health and lifestyle decision. He's framing it as her being gross, which might be an overreaction. Also, the fact that he's using terms that could be seen as dismissive or derogatory (\"basic white girl feminist\") suggests he's not approaching the conversation respectfully.\n\nOn the other hand, living together does require some consideration for each other's comfort. If the author is using a practice that could realistically cause issues beyond her underwear, maybe there's room for negotiation. But she says she's been careful for six months without incidents. So the boyfriend's anger seems more about his discomfort than actual harm.\n\nThe emotional impact is also important. The author is crying and feeling judged, while the boyfriend feels justified. That imbalance in the emotional response might indicate that he's not handling the situation well. The author getting upset in response to his judgment seems reasonable.\n\nSo, considering personal autonomy, the lack of actual issues beyond her underwear, and the disrespectful language from the boyfriend, the author is probably not the asshole here. The boyfriend's reaction is more problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
