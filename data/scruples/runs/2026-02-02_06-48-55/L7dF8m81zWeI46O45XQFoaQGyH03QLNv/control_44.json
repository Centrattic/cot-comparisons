I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation involves free bleeding, which is a personal choice some people make for various reasons, like discomfort with products, cost, or personal preference. The author mentioned free bleeding casually during a conversation with her boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult because she's not using tampons. He's worried about staining things, even though she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear in six months. The author is upset, feeling insulted by his comments about being a \"basic white girl feminist\" and is crying, while the boyfriend feels justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of free bleeding. It's a valid personal choice for some people, and there are arguments for it, like bodily autonomy and rejecting the stigma around menstruation. However, in a shared living space, there can be practical considerations. The boyfriend might be concerned about hygiene or cleanliness, which is a reasonable concern in a shared environment. But his reaction seems harsh, especially since there's no history of staining beyond her underwear. His insults about being \"gross\" and calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" are problematic because they dismiss her choice and use a derogatory term. That kind of rhetoric is disrespectful and could be seen as an attack on her identity or beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's choice to free bleed is her own, and if she's not causing actual mess or harm beyond what's expected (like soiled underwear), then the boyfriend's reaction might be overblown. However, in a shared space, if someone's habits could affect others, there's a balance to be struck. But in this case, the boyfriend's main concern is theoretical\u2014stains that haven't actually occurred. His reaction seems to be more about his own discomfort or judgment rather than a legitimate issue.\n\nThe key points are the boyfriend's judgmental language and the validity of the author's personal choice. The boyfriend's comments about her being \"gross\" and the feminist remark are likely the main issues here. The author is upset because her partner is insulting her personal choice and not respecting her autonomy, which is a significant aspect of a healthy relationship. The boyfriend isn't acknowledging her agency, which can lead to feelings of being invalidated or disrespected.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Her choice to free bleed is a personal one, and while partners should discuss practical living arrangements, the boyfriend's reaction crosses into being insulting and disrespectful. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
