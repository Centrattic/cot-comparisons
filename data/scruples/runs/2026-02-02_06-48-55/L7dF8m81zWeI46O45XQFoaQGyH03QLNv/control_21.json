He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author mentioning that she freebleeds, which means she doesn't use menstrual products and lets her blood flow freely. The boyfriend is upset about this, saying she's gross and not an adult because she's not spending money on tampons. The roommate is also involved in the conversation. The author is upset with the boyfriend's reaction, feeling insulted and crying.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Freebleeding is a personal choice, often related to feminist views or personal health reasons. It's about autonomy over one's body. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on hygiene and potential mess, but the author points out that she hasn't stained anything except her underwear. He's been worried for months, but the actual issue hasn't materialized. The author is getting defensive, feeling called out for being a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which is a stereotype that can be dismissive.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: The author didn't force her choice on others; she mentioned it casually. The boyfriend's reaction seems overblown since the problem he's worried about (staining things) hasn't happened. He's making judgments about her habits and calling her gross, which is disrespectful. The author's anger is a response to being insulted and criticized for her personal choice. The roommate might not be part of the direct conflict here, but the main issue is between the author and her boyfriend.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? She's making a choice about her body, which is her right. The boyfriend's criticism is about her personal habits in their shared space, but he's not the one who has to deal with the menstrual cycle. His judgment could be rooted in traditional views that see menstruation as something to be hidden or managed in specific ways. The author's choice to freebleed is a valid personal decision, and his reaction is more about his discomfort than actual harm. The fact that she hasn't caused a mess yet supports her stance that she's managing it responsibly.\n\nThe boyfriend's use of the term \"basic white girl feminist\" is a stereotype that could be seen as belittling her reasons for freebleeding. This adds a layer of personal attack, which is unfair. The author's crying and retreating to the spare room suggests emotional distress from his harsh words. In terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend is overreacting and making personal attacks, while the author is defending her autonomy. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
