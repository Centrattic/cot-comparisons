He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting. I\u2019m currently crying in the spare bedroom with my cats while he feels justified. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author free-bleeding and her boyfriend being upset about it. She's crying now, and he's calling her a basic white feminist and gross.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free-bleeding is. From what I know, it's when someone doesn't use tampons or pads during their period, often as a form of activism against the stigma around menstruation. So, the author might be doing this intentionally to challenge societal norms. \n\nHer boyfriend is upset because he's worried about staining things, even though she hasn't actually stained anything except her underwear. He's also calling her a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which sounds like a derogatory term. That's a red flag. Insulting someone's beliefs or choices, even if you disagree, is not okay. \n\nThe author is upset because her boyfriend is overreacting and making her feel bad for her choice. Free-bleeding is a personal choice and a social issue, so she has the right to make that decision. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on his personal discomfort or misunderstanding, not on any actual harm she's caused. \n\nHe's also making it about himself by saying it affects him too because he lives there. But unless there's a shared space that's actually been stained, which hasn't happened, his concern might be unfounded. The fact that he's escalating the situation by using insults and leaving her crying in the spare room is problematic. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but based on the analysis, the boyfriend's behavior seems more at fault. The author is standing up for her beliefs, and the boyfriend is dismissing her and being disrespectful. So the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. She has the right to her choice, and the boyfriend's reaction is the issue here.\n"
