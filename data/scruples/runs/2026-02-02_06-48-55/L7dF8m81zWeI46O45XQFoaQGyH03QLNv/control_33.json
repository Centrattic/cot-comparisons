He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author discussing their choice to free bleed with their boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset about it, saying it's gross and that the author isn't acting like an adult because they don't buy tampons. The author is upset and feels insulted, crying in the spare room.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what free bleeding is. From what I know, it's when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and instead lets blood flow naturally. It's a personal choice, often related to body autonomy or financial reasons, though it can have practical challenges. The author mentions they haven't stained anything except their underwear, but the boyfriend is worried about possible accidents.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is that the author is being gross and a basic white feminist. The author is getting mad at that. The key points here are consent, shared living space, and mutual respect. \n\nIn a shared living situation, people's choices can affect each other. The boyfriend might feel that the author's choice could lead to messes, which is a valid concern. However, the author has been free bleeding for months without issues except for their underwear. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his personal discomfort rather than an actual problem. His comparison to \"basic white girl feminism\" seems dismissive and disrespectful, which is problematic.\n\nThe author's right to make personal health decisions is important. However, they also need to consider their roommate's and boyfriend's feelings if their actions genuinely affect them. But in this case, the author isn't causing actual harm beyond their own underwear. The boyfriend's anger seems misplaced if there's no real mess. The author's reaction to being called gross and insulted is a natural defense of their choice.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's choice isn't causing actual problems, but the boyfriend is upset without a valid reason, then the boyfriend might be the one in the wrong. The author isn't obligated to spend money on products they don't want to use, and their decision is a personal one. The boyfriend's judgment and insults are the real issue here. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
