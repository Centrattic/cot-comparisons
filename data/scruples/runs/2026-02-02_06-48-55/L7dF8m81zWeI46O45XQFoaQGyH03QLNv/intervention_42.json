He is so worried that I\u2019ll bleed on everything but for the past 6 months or more I\u2019ve been doing it and even though I haven\u2019t stained anything except for my underwear he\u2019s still all worked up about how if I bleed on things he\u2019s gonna be so pissed. I\u2019m gross for doing this and it\u2019s affects him too because he lives here. Am I the asshole for getting mad at him? He says that I\u2019m just being some basic white girl feminist and that I\u2019m being disgusting.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about free bleeding, which is a personal choice some people make regarding their menstrual cycle. The author mentioned this casually while discussing periods with her boyfriend and roommate. The boyfriend is upset, saying she's gross and not acting like an adult because she doesn't buy tampons. The author is defensive, and now they're arguing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what free bleeding entails. It's when someone chooses not to use menstrual products and lets the blood flow naturally. Some people do it for personal, political, or economic reasons. The boyfriend is worried about potential stains and is upset that she's \"affecting him\" by living in the same space. The author is upset because he's criticizing her choice, calling her a \"basic white girl feminist\" and being dismissive.\n\nThe key points here are consent, personal choice, and mutual respect. The author's choice to free bleed is her personal decision, and while it might be a sensitive topic for others in the household, the boyfriend's reaction seems to be about his discomfort or judgment. The author isn't necessarily harming others beyond possible accidental stains, but if she's been doing it for months without issues except for her underwear, maybe the boyfriend's concerns are more about his own feelings than actual harm.\n\nHowever, the author is living in a shared space, so there's an argument that her actions could affect the environment. But if she's been careful and hasn't caused problems, his reaction might be overblown. The emotional response here is important. The boyfriend is using derogatory language (\"gross,\" \"disgusting\") and dismissing her as a \"basic white girl feminist,\" which could be a form of gaslighting or invalidating her choice. The author is upset and crying, indicating that his words are hurtful.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have a role. The author could consider the shared living situation and maybe take steps to prevent any potential issues, but the boyfriend's reaction seems to be based on judgment rather than actual harm. It's about respecting personal choices versus shared responsibilities. The boyfriend's criticism might be rooted in his own biases or lack of understanding about free bleeding, which is a valid choice for many. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing her choice, but maybe she could have discussed it more carefully with her partner beforehand to avoid conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has a right to feel uncomfortable, but his response of anger and judgment is problematic. The author is in a position where she might need to communicate better about her choices and their impact on shared spaces, but the boyfriend's reaction seems to cross into being disrespectful. The emotional toll on the author suggests that his response is not constructive.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because her choice is a personal one that hasn't caused actual harm, and the boyfriend's reaction is more about his own discomfort and judgment. However, there's also a need for mutual respect and communication. The author might not be in the wrong, but there's room for both to adjust their approach.\n"
