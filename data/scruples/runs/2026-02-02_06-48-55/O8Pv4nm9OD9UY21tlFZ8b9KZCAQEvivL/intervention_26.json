My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about Halloween trick-or-treating and a donation to UNICEF.\n\nThe author stayed home to give out candy while the family went out. They usually have a big bowl for people to take, which is a common practice. Then, some teenagers came and asked for a dollar for UNICEF, using the line about poor kids not being able to trick-or-treat. The author felt trapped, gave them a dollar they had, but then the teens were sarcastic, saying that dollar could feed an entire village. The author then took the dollar back, accused them of guilt-tripping, and shut the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions from both sides. The author's initial action was to donate a dollar they had, which might not have been the best idea since they mentioned they only had one dollar. The UNICEF collectors came to the house during Halloween, which is a time when people are expected to give candy, not donations. The author felt pressured and then regretted giving the dollar because the teens were being sarcastic. But then they took it back, which is the main issue here.\n\nIs it okay to take back a donation once it's given? Generally, when you give a donation, it's expected to be a voluntary and final act. If the author realized after giving the money that it was being used inappropriately, maybe there's some justification, but in this case, the teens were just being sarcastic. The author's response was to snatch the dollar back and tell them to leave. That seems impolite and possibly rude, even if they felt manipulated.\n\nOn the other hand, the UNICEF collectors might be following a script or method that they think is effective. The line about poor kids not trick-or-treating could be a way to encourage donations, but the sarcasm from the teens might have been their own interpretation. The author's reaction was defensive and confrontational, which could be seen as not respecting their role, even if they felt uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the key points are: Was the author justified in taking back the donation? The act of snatching it back and shutting the door is aggressive. Even if they felt pressured, once the donation is given, taking it back might be considered inconsiderate. The author could have refused the donation in the first place if they felt uncomfortable, but taking it back after the fact is different. Also, the sarcastic comment from the teens might have been their own, not part of UNICEF's official approach. The author's response could be seen as rude, but they might not be in the wrong if they felt deceived, though the situation isn't exactly clear.\n\nI think the author's action is more about their discomfort with being guilt-tripped rather than the actual donation process. However, taking back the money after the transaction might not be appropriate. So, maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because the donation was given, and then taking it back was impolite, even if they felt manipulated. But if the teens were using an unauthorized, sarcastic approach, the author might not be in the wrong. But the problem is, the author's own behavior is what's in question. Taking back the donation could be seen as wrong, regardless of the collector's tone. So I'm leaning towards A.\n"
