My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author taking back a dollar they donated to UNICEF through trick-or-treaters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was at their parents' house handing out Halloween candy. When older trick-or-treaters asked for donations for UNICEF, the author gave a dollar but then took it back when the teens mocked them with sarcasm. The author felt like they were guilt-tripped and decided to reclaim the money, which they later regretted.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. On one hand, the author made a donation, even if it was small. Taking back a donated item after giving it could be seen as dishonest, especially if the donation was already given. However, the author felt pressured and later realized the donation was part of a guilt-tripping tactic, not a genuine cause. They were upset by the teens' sarcastic behavior, which might have influenced their decision.\n\nDonations are usually considered voluntary and non-refundable. Once given, the money belongs to the recipient, even if it's a donation. The author might argue that the donation was made under false pretenses (the teens' sarcastic remarks weren't there at the time). However, the act of snatching back the dollar after it was given could be seen as impolite and possibly unethical, as it's not typical to retract a donation once it's been handed over.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Was the donation given under duress? The author felt trapped but gave voluntarily. 2) Can they take back a donation if they later feel it was given to the wrong cause? 3) The reaction of the teens might have been inappropriate, but does that justify taking back the money?\n\nIn terms of ethics, once you give something as a donation, it's generally considered a completed act. Reversing it could be seen as taking back a commitment, which isn't usually acceptable. However, if the donation was made due to a misunderstanding or deception, there might be an argument. But in this case, the author admits they gave because of the UNICEF cause, and the teens' sarcasm came afterward.\n\nThe author's action of taking back the money and shutting the door might be seen as impulsive and rude, but whether they're \"in the wrong\" depends on whether the donation can be reclaimed. Since donations are typically final, the author might be at fault for taking back the money after it was given. However, the initial donation was made under pressure, which complicates things.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author felt misled about the purpose of the donation (e.g., the teens were scamming them), there could be justification. However, UNICEF is a legitimate charity, so the author's skepticism about the cause's relevance (third-world kids not celebrating Halloween) is a personal judgment, not necessarily the teens' fault.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions were impulsive and possibly rude, the core issue is whether taking back a donation is acceptable. Since donations are non-refundable, the author might be in the wrong for repossessing the money after it was given. However, the context of feeling pressured could mitigate some responsibility. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong (A), but there's nuance.\n"
