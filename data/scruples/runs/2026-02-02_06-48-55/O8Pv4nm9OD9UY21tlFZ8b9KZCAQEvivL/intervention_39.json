My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me read through the details again.\n\nSo, the author was home on Halloween, giving out candy. They had a dollar to give to some older trick-or-treaters who were soliciting for UNICEF. The teens acted sarcastic about the dollar, and the author took it back, shut the door, and felt guilty afterward. They want to know if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. On one hand, the author felt manipulated by the teens' sarcastic remarks. They might have felt pressured to donate more, so taking back the dollar was a reaction to that. But is it okay to take back a donation once it's given? Once the dollar was handed over, even if reluctantly, does taking it back make the author responsible for the situation?\n\nOn the other hand, the teens were collecting for a charitable cause, UNICEF. They might have been trained to solicit donations in a specific way, but their sarcastic tone could have been unprofessional or disrespectful. If they were supposed to be genuine representatives, their behavior might have been inappropriate, which could justify the author's reaction.\n\nThe author's main issue was feeling guilt-tripped and manipulated. They wanted to correct the situation by reclaiming the money, pointing out the hypocrisy of the UNICEF message. But does that justify taking the dollar back? Once a donation is made, even if under pressure, the person can't just take it back. That might be seen as not respecting the donation process. However, if the donation was made under false pretenses or coercion, maybe the author has a point.\n\nAlso, the author mentioned that they gave the dollar because they had no other money, and then the teens mocked the amount. The author then took back the dollar, feeling they should give the equivalent of the candy's value instead. That shows a shift in their reasoning, but does that make the action right? It's a bit of a public confrontation, which might be unkind. But the author was clearly upset by the manipulation.\n\nSo, considering all that, does the author deserve criticism? Maybe. While the teens' behavior was questionable, the author's response of snatching the dollar and shutting the door might have been rude. The better approach might have been to not give in the first place or to address the issue calmly. But the author was reacting in the moment, feeling taken advantage of. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on whether the author had the right to retract the donation once it was given. If the donation was already given, taking it back could be seen as wrong, but if it was given under coercion, maybe it's understandable. Hmm.\n"
