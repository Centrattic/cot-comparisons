My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about donating to UNICEF on Halloween. The author stayed home to hand out candy while their family went trick-or-treating. Then, two teenagers showed up asking for donations for UNICEF, making a sarcastic comment about a dollar feeding a village. The author took back the dollar, called them out for guilt-tripping, and slammed the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Halloween is a time when people typically give out candy, and the author was doing that. The UNICEF representatives were there to collect donations, which is a legitimate cause. The author gave a dollar but felt pressured and then took it back because of the sarcastic comment. \n\nWas the author wrong to take back the donation? Well, the donation was given in the moment, possibly under pressure. If the donor felt misled or that the request was manipulative, they might have the right to retract it. However, once a donation is made, it usually becomes the recipient's property. The sarcastic comment might have been inappropriate, but the author's reaction\u2014snatching the money and yelling\u2014could be seen as aggressive or disrespectful, even if they felt wronged.\n\nOn the other hand, the UNICEF reps' behavior could be questionable. Using sarcasm to highlight the generosity might be a tactic that the author found manipulative. The author might have felt that the request was exploiting people's guilt, especially if the connection between Halloween and UNICEF's cause wasn't clear. \n\nBut legally and ethically, once a donation is given, the donor usually can't take it back. However, in this case, the donation was just a dollar, and the author took it back right there. That might not hold up legally, but the question is about moral wrongness. \n\nThe author's actions might be defended as reacting to perceived manipulation. However, the method was confrontational. Maybe a better approach would have been to explain their discomfort and not give, rather than taking back the money. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the author felt pressured and the UNICEF reps were being sarcastic, maybe they have a point. But taking back the money after giving it could still be seen as wrong. However, considering the context, the author might not be entirely at fault. \n\nThe answer might be B (not in the wrong) because of the pressure and the reps' behavior, but I need to make sure. Alternatively, since the donation was made and then taken back, maybe A (wrong) is the case. But the key is whether the author acted inappropriately. Since the UNICEF reps might have been using guilt-tripping tactics, the author's reaction, while harsh, could be justified. So B might be correct.\n"
