My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for taking back a dollar they donated to UNICEF during Halloween. The situation is that they were handing out candy when teens approached for donations, accused them of guilt-tripping, and then took the dollar back after a sarcastic comment.\n\nFirst, the author gave a dollar, which they later felt was under pressure. Then, they took it back because they felt manipulated. The question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nDonations are usually voluntary. If someone donates under what they perceive as pressure, they might have the right to retract it, especially if it's a small amount. But does the act of taking it back make them wrong? Also, the teens' behavior was sarcastic and possibly mocking, which might justify the author's reaction. However, once a donation is given, the giver can't just take it back unless there's an agreement otherwise. So, legally, maybe the author is wrong. But morally, given the context of being pressured and the teens' sarcastic reaction, maybe not. \n\nThe key points: The author felt trapped, the teens used guilt-tripping, and the author reacted emotionally. The community might side with the author because the donation wasn't voluntary. So, answer B (not in the wrong). But need to check if retracting a donation is acceptable. In reality, once given, you can't take it back. But if it was given under duress or fraud, maybe. Since the donation was given in an uncomfortable situation, the author's retraction might be understandable. So, B.\n"
