My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story did something wrong by taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation involves a Halloween scenario where the author gave a dollar to UNICEF trick-or-treaters but then took it back because of the sarcastic comment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a situation where they were approached by older kids collecting for UNICEF. They gave a dollar, but the kids responded sarcastically. The author felt manipulated and took back the money. Now, the question is whether this was wrong.\n\nI should think about the principles involved. Donations are typically voluntary. If someone donates, they can change their mind before the money is given to the cause, right? But in this case, the author took back the money after giving it. So, was the donation already made when they snatched it back?\n\nAlso, the reason the author gave the dollar was because they only had a dollar in their wallet. Then, when the kids acted condescending, the author felt tricked. That's a key point. The author might have felt pressured into donating more than they intended due to the guilt-tripping. The sarcastic comment might have made the author realize they were being manipulated.\n\nBut then again, the author gave the dollar and then took it back. If the money was already given, even if it was out of the author's hand, is it acceptable to take it back? Maybe not. However, if the donation wasn't final, perhaps the author could have refused to give the dollar in the first place. But the author did give it, so taking it back might be seen as inappropriate because the transaction was completed, even if it was a moment of clarity.\n\nOn the other hand, the way the UNICEF kids approached the author was manipulative. They used guilt-tripping tactics, which might be a legitimate issue. The author's frustration is understandable. But does that justify taking back the donation after it was given? That's the crux.\n\nIn terms of ethics, once a donation is given, even if it was done under duress, the person who donated can't take it back. However, if the donation was made under false pretenses or coercion, maybe there's an argument. But in this case, the author gave the dollar and then took it back immediately. So it's more of a refusal to proceed with the donation after realizing the context.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author had the right to retract the donation after it was given. If the money was already handed over, the author can't take it back. However, if the donation wasn't yet transferred, the author could refuse. It seems like the author took the dollar out of their wallet, but the kid took it and waved it sarcastically. At that point, the donation might not have been finalized if the author immediately took it back. So maybe the author is justified in retracting the donation because the transaction wasn't completed, and they were feeling pressured.\n\nAnother angle is the intent of the UNICEF trick-or-treaters. If they were using manipulative tactics to get donations, that's problematic. The author's decision to not support their method is understandable. Even if the cause is good, the means of collection might be ethically questionable. So the author might be in the right for not supporting a manipulative fundraising method, even if it's for a good cause.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions might be understandable given the context of feeling pressured and the manipulative approach by the UNICEF representatives. The donation was retracted before it was finalized, and the author had the right to reconsider upon realizing the method used to collect. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
