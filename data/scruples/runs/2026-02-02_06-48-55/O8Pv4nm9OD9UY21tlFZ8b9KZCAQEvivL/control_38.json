My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author was trick-or-treating alone, gave out candy as usual. Then some teenagers came, asked for donations for UNICEF, saying it's for kids in poor countries. The author gave a dollar but felt pressured. The teens acted sarcastically, so the author took back the dollar, criticized their approach, and shut the door.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider the facts. The author was in a situation where they were approached by the teens, who might have been part of UNICEF's fundraising for Halloween. The key points here are consent, the manner of the interaction, and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the author gave the dollar but then took it back. Legally, once a donation is given, can it be taken back? That's a gray area. But in practice, if someone is pressured or coerced, they might feel justified in retracting their donation. However, the author's response was confrontational. They snatched the dollar back and insulted the teens, which could be seen as rude or aggressive.\n\nAnother angle is the intent of UNICEF's fundraising. If the teens were genuinely trying to collect donations for a good cause, even if their approach was a bit pushy or sarcastic, the author's harsh reaction might be unwarranted. The author felt guilt-tripped, which is a common criticism of some fundraising tactics. But does that justify taking back the money?\n\nAlso, the author's argument that Third World kids don't celebrate Halloween and that the donation should go toward candy might be a misunderstanding. UNICEF's work does include helping children in all circumstances, not just during Halloween. The author's comment about giving 30-50 cents for candy versus a dollar for UNICEF might be a misallocation of priorities, but that's subjective.\n\nEthically, is it wrong to take back a donation? If the author felt coerced, they might have the right to retract it. However, the method of doing so\u2014being confrontational and rude\u2014could be the real issue here. The author's reaction might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the teens were just doing their job or trying to raise funds for a worthy cause.\n\nAlso, the teenagers' sarcastic behavior might have crossed a line, making the author feel trapped. But the appropriate response would be to politely decline rather than confront them aggressively. Taking the dollar back might be acceptable, but the manner in which it was done could be problematic.\n\nIn summary, while the author might feel justified in retracting the donation due to the pressure and inappropriate interaction, their response was rude and confrontational. The ethical consideration here is balancing the right to retract a donation with the method of doing so. The author's actions might not make them entirely in the wrong, but their approach was definitely harsh. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might hinge on whether the author had the right to take back the donation and how they handled it.\n"
