My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The story is about someone donating $1 to UNICEF through trick-or-treaters but then taking it back when the teens sarcastically commented about feeding a village.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the situation. The person gave the money initially, which is a charitable act. However, they then took it back because they felt the collection method was manipulative. The key points here are the right to take back a donation and the justification for doing so.\n\nIn most cases, once a donation is given, it's considered a gift. The donor can take it back if it's not yet handed over or if there's a legal reason, but once the money is given, retracting it might be problematic. However, in this case, the donor snatched the dollar back before it was officially a donation. The teens were acting on behalf of UNICEF, but if they were doing it in a way that felt coercive or manipulative, the donor's reaction might be understandable.\n\nAnother angle is the intent behind the donation. The person was uncomfortable with the guilt-tripping and the sarcastic remark. They felt taken advantage of, so taking back the money was a way to assert control. But is that justified? Donors can choose how and where to donate, and if they feel pressured, they have the right to withdraw their support. However, the method of taking it back might be seen as abrupt.\n\nAlso, the part about third-world countries not celebrating Halloween is a valid point. The donor is pointing out the hypocrisy in using a Western tradition to collect for other regions. That could be a legitimate reason to question the donation method, even if it's for a good cause.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If taking back the donation was a reaction to feeling coerced, even if the donation wasn't finalized, it's a personal choice. However, once the money is given, taking it back might not be appropriate unless there's a specific reason. The author's action might be seen as rude, but ethically, they might not be in the wrong if they felt pressured.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they felt manipulated and acted on their discomfort.\n"
