My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author stayed home to hand out Halloween candy. Teenagers came trick-or-treating, but instead of just taking candy, they asked for donations for UNICEF. The author felt pressured, gave a dollar, but then took it back after the teens mocked the donation. The author is now questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the context of the donation and the author's actions. The teenagers approached during a time when people are usually giving out candy, not donations. The author felt guilt-tripped by the UNICEF collectors. The author gave a dollar but then took it back when the teens were sarcastic. \n\nThe main question is whether the author was wrong to take back the money. Well, the author had the right to change their mind. Donations are voluntary, and if the collector's behavior made the author uncomfortable, they could retract the donation. However, the way the author snatched the dollar might have been rude. But the collectors' sarcastic comments could have justified the author's reaction. \n\nAlso, the author admitted they felt like an asshole but had a valid reason to be upset about being guilt-tripped. The UNICEF representatives might have been using a questionable tactic by approaching during Halloween, which is typically for candy, not donations. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author wasn't in the wrong for retracting the donation, especially since they were pressured. It's about the methods used by the collectors. So, the answer would lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author had the right to withdraw their donation, especially given the context.\n"
