My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong after taking back a donation they gave to UNICEF. \n\nFirst, the situation: The family was trick-or-treating, the parents are in an upper-middle-class neighborhood. The author stayed behind to hand out candy. Some teenagers showed up, asked for a donation for UNICEF, saying it's for poor kids. The author gives a dollar but is upset when the teens respond sarcastically, implying that the dollar could feed a village. Then the author takes the dollar back, tells them off, and slams the door.\n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. From the user's perspective, they think the author is in the wrong. The user wants to know if that's correct.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author gave the dollar under what felt like pressure or guilt-tripping. Then, when they realized the sarcasm and the insensitivity, they took it back. But is taking back a donation after it's been given, even if done so in anger, wrong?\n\nIn many places, once a donation is given, it's considered a gift and can't be reclaimed. So legally, the author might not have the right to take it back. But morally, maybe there's a different angle. The author felt manipulated and then acted on impulse. The teens were disrespectful and made a sarcastic comment, which could have been a trigger for the author's reaction.\n\nHowever, the act of taking back the money after it's been given could be seen as rude or even theft, depending on local laws. The author's reasoning is that the donation was under false pretenses, but once the money is given, it's a completed transaction unless there's some fraud involved. The teens didn't necessarily lie about the purpose; they just presented it in a way that the author found manipulative.\n\nAlso, the author's response was confrontational and shut the door. That could be seen as hostile. But the initial donation might have been under pressure, so the author might feel justified in retracting the donation upon realizing the manipulation.\n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, is the author at fault? If the donation was voluntary, even under pressure, taking it back after the fact could be problematic. On the other hand, the teens' behavior was disrespectful, which might mitigate the author's fault.\n\nSo maybe the answer is that the author is not in the wrong because they felt pressured and acted on impulse, even though their actions were not the most appropriate. But is that the case?\n\nAlternatively, the author gave the money, then took it back. If the donation was given and then taken back, that's not typical. But in the situation, the author might have felt that the donation was not being used as intended, but that's a stretch. The teens didn't say the money wouldn't be used for UNICEF; they just made a sarcastic remark. The author's reaction was to confront them, which might be seen as overreacting, but perhaps not entirely wrong.\n\nIn terms of morality, the author might not be in the wrong because they were reacting to perceived manipulation. However, the act of taking back the money after it's been given could be seen as wrong, regardless of the reason. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because once the money is given, they can't reclaim it. But if the context is that they felt coerced, maybe it's not so clear.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a tricky situation. The answer likely depends on cultural norms and personal ethics. If the author gave the money under pressure, then taking it back might be understandable, but it's still not a typical action. So perhaps the answer is A, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the author is not in the wrong because the situation was uncomfortable, and the teens were rude. But the act of taking the money back is still questionable.\n"
