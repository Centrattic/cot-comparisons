My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is about a Halloween trick-or-treating encounter where the author donated to UNICEF but later took the money back.\n\nFirst, the author was giving out candy as part of Halloween. Then some teenagers came asking for donations for UNICEF. The author had only a dollar in their wallet and gave it to them. The teens then acted sarcastically, which made the author take the dollar back. The author is now questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nHmm. So the author's actions were influenced by the teens' sarcastic remarks. They felt trapped initially, gave the dollar, then took it back because they thought the teens were using guilt-tripping tactics. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom one angle, the author gave the dollar voluntarily. Even if they felt pressured, once the money was given, taking it back after the fact could be seen as unfair to the teens or UNICEF. But maybe the author felt deceived or manipulated. The teens' sarcastic comments might have been a form of mockery, making the author feel they were being taken advantage of. \n\nBut wait, the teens were representing UNICEF. If they were collecting money for a good cause, even if their tone was sarcastic, the author might still have the right to take back the money if they felt misled. However, once a donation is given, it's usually considered a final transaction. The author could have refused to give the dollar in the first place if they were uncomfortable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have been in a moment of impulse when giving the dollar due to the pressure. Then, upon reflection, realized the donation didn't align with their values because of the guilt-tripping. In that case, taking it back could be justified as correcting a mistake. \n\nBut taking back the money after giving it might be seen as impolite or unfair. Donations are typically voluntary, and once given, the donor usually can't reclaim them. The author's action of snatching the dollar back could come across as rude, especially if the teens were just doing their job, even if poorly.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they took back money that was already given, which isn't standard practice. However, if the donation was given under false pretenses (the sarcastic remarks), the author could argue they were misled. But it's tricky because the author had the initial choice to donate or not. Maybe the teens' behavior was unprofessional, but the author's reaction was also impulsive. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author had the right to retract the donation after the fact. Generally, once a donation is made, it's considered a final act unless there's fraud involved. Since the author is now questioning the legitimacy of the request, but the teens were collecting for a real organization, maybe the author is in the wrong for taking it back. However, the context of the sarcastic remarks complicates things. So maybe the answer is that the author is not in the wrong because they felt manipulated, but the action of taking back the money is still questionable. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because the donation was voluntary and once given, retracting it isn't typical unless there was a problem. The author's reaction was impulsive and perhaps rude. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
