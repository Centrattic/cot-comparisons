My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author gave a dollar to UNICEF collectors during Halloween. The collectors used guilt-tripping, saying the dollar could feed a village. The author felt uncomfortable, snatched the dollar back, and shut the door. Now they're wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about the appropriateness of the author's reaction. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the details provided.\n\nThe author gave the dollar, then took it back. Legally, once the dollar is handed over, it's the collector's. But the author took it back physically. However, in the story, the author \"snatched\" the dollar from the collector. That seems like taking back a gift, which is a bit strange. But maybe the author felt deceived or manipulated.\n\nThe collectors used a guilt-tripping tactic, implying the dollar could feed a village. The author found this misleading because the actual cost of candy is much lower. The author's reaction was defensive and aggressive, which could be seen as rude. But the reason for the reaction was feeling manipulated.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, giving money to a charity is a personal choice, and the author did give it initially. But taking it back in a confrontational way might be considered rude. However, the collectors might have overplayed the impact of the donation. The author's anger stems from feeling tricked, which could be a valid reaction to manipulation, but their response was physical and abrupt.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have walked away or said no without confrontation. By taking back the money, they might have overstepped. But the collectors' approach was questionable. So, the answer might depend on whether the collectors were legitimate or not. UNICEF is a real organization, but their representatives might have been using hyperbolic language.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's action was impulsive and confrontational, which is not ideal. However, feeling manipulated is a legitimate concern. The author's mistake was in the method of handling the situation. Instead of snatching the money, they could have declined politely. So, the author is partially at fault for their reaction but perhaps not entirely wrong because they felt targeted.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer probably leans towards A (Yes), because once the money is given, taking it back aggressively is inappropriate. However, some might argue that the collectors were misleading, so the author's response is understandable. But the act of taking back the money is still uncool. So maybe the answer is A, but the situation is nuanced.\n"
