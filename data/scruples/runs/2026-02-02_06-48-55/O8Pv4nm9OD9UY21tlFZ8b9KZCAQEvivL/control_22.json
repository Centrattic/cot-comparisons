My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The scenario is a Halloween situation where they gave a dollar to some teens who were soliciting for UNICEF. The teens were being sarcastic, which made the person feel trapped, leading them to snatch the dollar back and shut the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. There's no law against taking back a donation once it's given, right? So legally, the person isn't in the wrong. But the question is about moral or social wrongness. \n\nThe person was in the process of donating, but the experience was negative. The teens used a guilt-tripping approach, which the person found manipulative. They felt coerced into giving the dollar. Taking it back might be seen as a reaction to feeling pressured. On the other hand, UNICEF is a legitimate charity, so there's an argument that refusing to support a good cause because of the solicitation method is wrong.\n\nThe key points are: the donation was given under pressure, the person felt manipulated, and the response was defensive. The person's intention was to give candy to kids, not donate to UNICEF. The teens' approach was inappropriate, and the person's reaction, while abrupt, might be justified given the situation.\n\nMoral responsibility here is tricky. The person isn't obligated to donate, especially if they felt uncomfortable. The way the teens asked might be at fault here. The person's right to withdraw their donation, although already given, might be debatable, but in practice, if they take it back immediately, it's not illegal. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer leans towards the person not being in the wrong (B). They were reacting to a manipulative solicitation method and felt their initial donation was coerced. They still support kids in their neighborhood, which shows they care about helping others. The issue was the approach by the solicitors, not the donor's reaction.\n"
