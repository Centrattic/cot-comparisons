My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking back a dollar they donated to UNICEF through trick-or-treaters. \n\nFirst, the context: On Halloween, the author stayed home to hand out candy. When teenagers showed up asking for a donation for UNICEF, they were told that the money could \"feed an entire village\" sarcastically. The author then took back the dollar and shut the door.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author gave a dollar, which they later felt was under duress due to the guilt-tripping. They pulled the dollar back because they felt manipulated. The teenagers were using the Halloween tradition to solicit donations, possibly in a mocking way. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, once a donation is given, it becomes the recipient's property. But this case is different because the donation was taken back immediately after being given, and the context was a public solicitation. \n\nEthically, the author might feel they were pressured into donating and decided to retract it. However, the teenagers might argue they were doing a legitimate fundraiser. But their sarcastic comments could be seen as exploiting the situation for their own amusement rather than a genuine cause. \n\nIn some places, these \"trick or treat for UNICEF\" drives are sanctioned and have specific guidelines. If the teens were part of an official program, the author might be expected to follow through. However, if the teens were acting on their own or misrepresenting the cause with sarcasm, the author's reaction could be justified. \n\nThe author's act of taking back the dollar could be seen as a mistake if it was a public donation event. But given the way the teens presented it, the author might not be in the wrong. They had the right to reconsider immediately since the donation wasn't formalized in a contract. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B). They had the right to retract the donation given the context and manner of the solicitation.\n"
