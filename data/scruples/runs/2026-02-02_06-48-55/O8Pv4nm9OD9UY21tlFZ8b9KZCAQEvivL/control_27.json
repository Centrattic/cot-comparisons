My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took back their UNICEF donation was in the wrong. The scenario is about a Halloween event where the author gave out candy and was approached by teenagers collecting for UNICEF. The key points here are the context of the donation, the manner in which the teens presented their request, and the author's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author was in a situation where they offered to stay home and give out candy. The neighborhood is upper middle class, and they usually provide full-sized candy bars, which is a nice gesture. The teens showed up, asked for a donation for UNICEF, and made a sarcastic comment about a dollar feeding a village. The author felt trapped, gave a dollar, then took it back because of the sarcasm and the UNICEF approach.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Donations are voluntary. The author initially gave the dollar, but then took it back. The question is whether the author was wrong in doing so. \n\nOn one hand, the author might have felt manipulated by the teens' sarcastic remarks, which could be seen as guilt-tripping. The author's decision to take back the money could be a reaction to feeling that the donation wasn't being handled respectfully. Also, the author pointed out that third-world countries don't celebrate Halloween, which adds a layer of irrelevance to the UNICEF request in that context. The author's action of taking back the money might be seen as a stand against being guilted into a donation, especially since they were in a situation where they didn't expect to be asked for a contribution.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did give a dollar first. By taking it back, they might be violating the social norm of keeping a donation once given, even if there was initial hesitation. However, the situation is complicated by the teens' behavior. The sarcastic comment could be seen as disrespectful, which might justify the author's reaction. Also, the author's reasoning about the cost of candy versus the donation to UNICEF adds another angle. The author felt that the donation was not being used appropriately given the context of Halloween and the actual needs of the children in poor countries.\n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong because they can retract a donation at any time, especially if they feel it's being misused. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The author's actions were a response to perceived manipulation and sarcasm, which could be seen as a justified reaction to an uncomfortable situation. The key here is that the author was not forced to donate in the first place, and taking back the money was a personal decision based on their discomfort with the interaction.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were a reaction to feeling manipulated and disrespected. Since donations are voluntary and the author had the right to change their mind, especially in light of the teens' behavior, the author is not in the wrong. The correct answer would be B.\n"
