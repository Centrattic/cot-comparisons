My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation involves trick-or-treaters asking for donations, which the author gave but then felt pressured and took back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was alone giving out candy, and the teenagers approached them. The author gave a dollar, but the teens responded sarcastically, making a comment about feeding a village. The author then took the dollar back, criticized the approach, and slammed the door.\n\nNow, the main points to consider: Was the author justified in feeling trapped? The trick-or-treaters used a guilt-based approach. The author might feel manipulated, but once a donation is made, is it appropriate to take it back? Also, the author's response was confrontational and possibly rude. The sarcastic comment from the teens might have escalated the situation.\n\nEthically, once a donation is given, even if under pressure, retracting it could be seen as inappropriate. However, if the method of fundraising was deceptive or coercive, that's another angle. The author's immediate reaction was emotional, which is understandable, but the action of taking the money back and the harsh words might be where they're at fault. \n\nOn the other hand, the teens' behavior was inconsiderate, mocking the donor. The author might have felt disrespected. But does that justify taking back the donation? The author could have refused to give more, but taking back the already given money and being rude could be seen as wrong. \n\nSo, the author's actions, while possibly understandable due to the teens' behavior, might still be in the wrong because retracting a donation isn't typical, and the response was harsh. However, if the fundraising method was manipulative, the author's frustration is valid. The key here is whether the donation was a voluntary act, and if retracting it was a reasonable response.\n"
