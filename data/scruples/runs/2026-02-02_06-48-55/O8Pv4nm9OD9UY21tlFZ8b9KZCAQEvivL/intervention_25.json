My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation involves the author giving out Halloween candy while their family was away. Teenagers came trick-or-treating for UNICEF, which the author found manipulative. The author gave $1, then took it back after feeling tricked by the teens' sarcastic remarks. Now, the user thinks the author might be in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author felt pressured into giving the donation because of the guilt-tripping by the teens. The key points are whether the author had the right to take back the money once given. In general, once a donation is made, it's considered a completed transaction unless there's fraud or coercion involved. However, the author didn't know the true purpose of the donation at the time. The teens misrepresented UNICEF's cause as a way to guilt-trip people, which might be considered deceptive. \n\nBut wait, UNICEF itself isn't necessarily at fault here. The teenagers might have been misrepresenting the organization's mission, perhaps exaggerating or using inappropriate methods. The author's reaction was to snatch back the money, which is impolite, but maybe justified if the donation was given under false pretenses. However, the author could have handled it more gracefully, like explaining their change of heart instead of being confrontational. \n\nThe question of whether the author is in the wrong hinges on intent and the nature of the donation. If the author was misled, then taking back the money might be understandable. But once a donation is given, retracting it isn't common practice unless there's a misunderstanding or fraud. The author's approach was harsh, but the situation involved some elements of manipulation by the teens. \n\nOn the other hand, the act of taking back a donation can be seen as ungracious, even if the initial donation was made under pressure. The author could have addressed the issue differently, such as not giving in the first place or speaking to UNICEF directly if they had concerns. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong because once a donation is made, it's generally expected to be final. However, the manipulation by the teens complicates things. The rightness or wrongness isn't clear-cut, but the author's aggressive reaction might be seen as the issue rather than the act of taking back the donation itself.\n"
