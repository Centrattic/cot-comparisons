My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The scenario is during Halloween when they gave out candy and were approached by teens asking for donations for UNICEF. The author gave a dollar but then took it back because of the sarcastic comment and the way they felt tricked.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a situation where they usually give candy freely. The teens approached with a different request\u2014donating to UNICEF. The author felt pressured and didn't like the manipulation, so they took back the dollar. \n\nThe key points here are: Was the approach by the teens appropriate? Did the author have a right to take back the donation? The teens used guilt-tripping tactics with the sarcastic remark, which the author found offensive. The author's reaction was emotional, but they later felt bad about it.\n\nLegally, once a donation is given, can it be taken back? Well, the dollar was given, but the author snatched it back immediately. If the transaction wasn't completed (i.e., the money wasn't handed over yet), the author might have the right to retract. But if the money was already given, taking it back could be seen as a problem. However, in this case, the author didn't let the teens keep the dollar, so maybe it's a split-second decision made in the heat of the moment.\n\nEthically, the author might feel wronged because they were pressured. The teens' sarcastic comment about feeding a village with a dollar could be seen as mocking the donor's contribution. The author's reaction is a form of protest against perceived exploitation. However, taking back the donation in that manner could be seen as rude, even if the author had a valid reason.\n\nOn the other hand, the teens were doing a legitimate charity effort, using a common method of collecting donations. The author chose to donate initially but then changed their mind due to the interaction. The author's action might be justified if they felt misled, but the method of taking the money back might be considered inconsiderate.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's action was a reasonable response to being manipulated. If the teens used guilt-tripping and sarcasm, the author's frustration is understandable. However, taking back the donation immediately after giving it could be seen as the author's fault for not standing their ground initially. Alternatively, the author had the right to withdraw their donation if they felt it was given under false pretenses.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were reacting to a situation that felt exploitative. But if the charity's approach was within acceptable bounds, then the author's reaction might be the issue. However, the sarcastic comment was likely a tactic to make the donor feel their contribution was insignificant, which could be seen as manipulative. So, the author's action might be justified as a response to that manipulation.\n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the author was reacting to a situation where they felt pressured and used guilt-tripping tactics. The immediate withdrawal of the donation was a response to that, and given the context, it's a valid reaction. The charity's approach might have been questionable, so the author isn't entirely at fault.\n"
