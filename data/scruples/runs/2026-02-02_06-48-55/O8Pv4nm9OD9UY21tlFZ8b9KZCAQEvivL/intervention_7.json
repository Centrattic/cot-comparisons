My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation is that during Halloween, the author stayed home to hand out candy. Some teenagers came trick-or-treating for UNICEF, and after a sarcastic comment, the author took back the dollar they had given.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author gave $1 initially but felt manipulated, so they snatched it back and shut the door. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants my opinion. \n\nSo, what's the key point here? The author's actions are in question. Let's break it down. When someone asks for a donation, especially for a cause like UNICEF, there's an expectation that the donation is given in good faith. The author gave the dollar, but then decided to take it back after feeling pressured or insulted. \n\nIs that okay? Well, once a donation is made, it's generally considered a completed transaction. Taking it back might be seen as unethical or disrespectful. However, the author felt that they were being guilt-tripped, and the teenagers' sarcastic remark might have triggered that reaction. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation. But does that justify taking back the money? If the author felt pressured, maybe they should have declined to donate in the first place. However, once the money is given, retracting it could be seen as rude or even theft. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author might argue that they were coerced into donating because of the guilt-tripping. If that's the case, the donation wasn't voluntary, so it's not their fault for taking it back. But in reality, the author had the choice to say no initially. Once the money is handed over, taking it back is problematic. \n\nAlso, the teenagers might have overstepped with their sarcastic comment, which could have made the author feel disrespected. However, the appropriate response would be to decline further interaction rather than taking back the money. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action of taking back the donation after giving it might be seen as wrong because it's generally expected that donations are final once given. Even if the author felt pressured, the correct response would be to not give in the first place or politely decline, not retrieve the money after. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
