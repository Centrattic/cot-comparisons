My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about someone taking back a dollar they donated to UNICEF through trick-or-treaters. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author was home alone giving out Halloween candy. Some older kids came around, said \"trick or treat... for UNICEF,\" and gave a guilt-tripping speech about poor kids. The author felt pressured, gave a dollar, but then took it back, got angry, and shut the door.\n\nThe key points here: Was the donation given under duress? The author felt trapped and later regretted it. But when they took back the money, was that justified? \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, once you give money, it's theirs. Taking it back might be considered theft. But maybe in this context, since it's a donation, it's different. However, the act of snatching the money and shutting the door was confrontational. \n\nEthically, the author might feel they were manipulated into giving by the UNICEF pitch. But the trick-or-treaters were representing UNICEF, even if their approach was pushy. The author's reaction was aggressive. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. The answer depends on whether the donation was a voluntary act. If the person felt coerced and then reclaimed the money as a way to correct that, maybe it's understandable. But taking it back physically is another issue. \n\nI think the community might have mixed views. Some might say the author was in the right because they felt tricked. Others might say that you can't just take back money you gave, even if you regret it. \n\nAlso, the part where the author mentions that third-world kids don't celebrate Halloween is a bit of a point. The UNICEF representatives might have misused the situation by linking Halloween to their cause in a way that's not accurate. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be in the wrong. They acted on an impulse to correct a perceived manipulation. But their method was aggressive. However, since they felt coerced into the donation, taking it back might be seen as a reaction to that pressure. \n\nI think the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the situation involved pressure tactics, and the author's response, while harsh, was a result of feeling manipulated. But there's a nuance here. Alternatively, some might argue that once the donation is given, it's theirs, so taking it back is wrong regardless. \n\nHmm. I need to decide. The key here is the intent and the context. The author was pressured, perhaps unfairly, and then corrected their mistake. But physically snatching the money and shutting the door is a problem. However, the community might empathize with the author's frustration. \n\nIn AITA threads, people often consider the intent and the manipulation aspect. If the UNICEF reps used guilt-tripping, that's a factor. So the author's reaction is understandable. Therefore, B is probably the correct answer.\n"
