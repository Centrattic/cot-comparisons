My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about Halloween trick-or-treating where the author gives out candy while their family is away. Then some teenagers come asking for a UNICEF donation, which the author donates a dollar. The teens respond sarcastically, leading the author to take back the dollar and shut the door. The author feels guilty but thinks UNICEF was taking advantage.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author initially donates a dollar but takes it back after a sarcastic comment. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLegally, once a donation is given, it's a completed transaction. But the author took it back, which could be considered theft. However, the context is important. The teens used guilt-tripping and sarcasm, which might have pressured the donor. The author felt manipulated, so taking back the money might be seen as reclaiming a donation given under duress.\n\nEthically, it's more complex. The author had the right to refuse donations, but once given, taking back might be frowned upon. But if the donation was under false pretenses or manipulation, it's a different story. The author felt tricked into giving more than they intended because of the teens' approach.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness of the charity. The teens claimed the dollar could feed a village, which might be an exaggeration. The author points out that third-world kids don't celebrate Halloween, so the context of the donation request is questionable. This could imply that the charity's method was inappropriate, leading the author to react strongly.\n\nHowever, the act of taking the dollar back is confrontational. The author could have refused to donate in the first place instead of snatching it. But the situation was heated, and the author felt cornered. The sarcastic comment might have been provocative, prompting a defensive reaction.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might have overreacted, but they also had the right to feel pressured. The key is whether the author's actions were justified given the circumstances. If the donation was made under undue influence (the guilt-tripping and sarcasm), then reclaiming it could be justified. However, physically taking back the money might be seen as aggressive.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the author was in a stressful situation, felt manipulated, and acted on impulse. While taking back the donation could be seen as a mistake, the context of the interaction with the teens plays a significant role. The answer might hinge on whether the author's reaction was a reasonable response to being pressured by the teens.\n"
