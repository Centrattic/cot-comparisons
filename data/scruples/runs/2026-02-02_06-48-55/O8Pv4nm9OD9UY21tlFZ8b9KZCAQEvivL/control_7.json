My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Halloween, and the author stayed home to hand out candy while their family went trick-or-treating. Then some teenagers showed up asking for donations for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping tactics. The author gave a dollar, then took it back because of the sarcastic comment and the way they were pressured.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author gave the dollar initially, but then felt manipulated. The teens made a sarcastic remark implying that a dollar could feed a village, which the author found offensive and deceptive. The author took back the money, scolded the teens, and slammed the door.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author was in a situation where they felt pressured. They gave money but then changed their mind. Legally, once money is given as a donation, it generally belongs to the recipient. However, since the donation was made under what the author perceived as coercive or misleading circumstances, maybe they have a right to retract it? But I'm not sure about the legal aspect here. Ethically, if the teens were using deceptive tactics, maybe the author is justified in taking back the money.\n\nOn the other hand, the author initially gave the dollar, so maybe they had a chance to say no. Also, the teens were collecting for UNICEF, which is a charitable cause. The author's reaction might be seen as harsh, but the pressure tactics could be considered problematic as well. The line between ethical fundraising and harassment can be blurry. If the teens were using guilt-tripping, that might not be appropriate, and the author might feel justified in their actions.\n\nAnother angle: The author mentions that third-world kids don't celebrate Halloween. The teens were there for a UNICEF collection, which might be a legitimate event. However, the way they presented the donation might have been exaggerated or misleading. If the author felt tricked into giving more than they intended, taking back the money could be seen as a response to that. \n\nBut then, once a donation is made, can you take it back? If the teens were official collectors, the author's action might be problematic. However, if they were just kids doing a school project or something, maybe not. The story doesn't clarify if the teens were officially representing UNICEF. If they were, taking back the money might be stealing. If not, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the emotional aspect: the author felt trapped. They might have acted in the heat of the moment. The sarcastic comment from the teen could have pushed them over the edge. The author's reaction, while perhaps rude, might be a result of feeling manipulated. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the community often considers intentions and whether the person acted unkindly without just cause. If the author felt they were being coerced, maybe they aren't at fault. Alternatively, if the teens were just doing a legitimate charity event, the author might be in the wrong for taking back the donation and being rude.\n\nBut the key here is the pressure tactics. If the teens were using guilt to get more donations, that's unethical. The author's response, while confrontational, might be a reaction to unethical behavior. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (No), because the author was reacting to what they perceived as manipulative tactics, and taking back the money under those circumstances could be justified. However, if the teens were acting within their rights to collect donations, then the author might be in the wrong. But since the story doesn't clarify the legitimacy of the teens' role, but focuses on the pressure tactics, the author's actions might be seen as a justified defense against manipulation.\n"
