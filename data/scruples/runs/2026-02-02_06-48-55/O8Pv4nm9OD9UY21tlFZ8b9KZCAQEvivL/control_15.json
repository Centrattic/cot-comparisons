My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe person stayed home to give out Halloween candy while their family went trick-or-treating. Then, some teenagers showed up asking for donations for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping tactics. The person gave a dollar, but then the teens acted sarcastically, which made them snap. They took back the dollar, got angry, and slammed the door.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, once a donation is given, can you take it back? Probably not, unless there's some specific condition. But the user is asking about moral wrong, not legal. \n\nEthically, the author gave the dollar under the impression that it was for a good cause. The teens, however, used manipulative tactics to get the donation, which might have made the author feel pressured. The author's reaction was to take back the money because they felt deceived or manipulated. \n\nBut was the author wrong? Well, the UNICEF collectors were doing their job, even if they came off as sarcastic. The author might have overreacted. On the other hand, being pressured into donating when the person feels uncomfortable might be a valid reason to retract the donation. \n\nAlso, the context is Halloween. The author was expecting to give candy, not money. The teens used a common trick-or-treat method for donations, but the author wasn't prepared for that. The tone of the collectors could have been handled better. \n\nThe author's anger might be justified because they felt tricked. But taking back the money after giving it could be seen as rude, even if the initial donation was under pressure. However, the author might have felt that the donation wasn't being used as intended. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The author might not be in the wrong because they were pressured and then felt deceived. The collectors might have been insincere, which led to the author's reaction. However, the act of taking back the money after it's been given could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nSo, the answer might be B: No, the author isn't in the wrong. They were in an uncomfortable situation and acted on impulse when feeling manipulated. The collectors' behavior contributed to the situation. But others might argue that once the donation is given, taking it back isn't right, especially if the collectors were following their usual method. \n\nBut given that the author felt they were being guilt-tripped and the collectors acted sarcastically, their reaction is understandable. They might not be in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
