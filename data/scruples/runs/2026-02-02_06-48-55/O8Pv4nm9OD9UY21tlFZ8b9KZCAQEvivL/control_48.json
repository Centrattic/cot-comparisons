My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person stayed home to hand out Halloween candy while their family went trick-or-treating. Some teenagers showed up, asked for a donation for UNICEF, using a guilt-tripping approach. The writer gave a dollar but felt pressured, then took it back because they thought the teens were being sarcastic and manipulative. They shut the door, later feeling conflicted.\n\nSo, the key points here are the context of the donation and the reaction. The writer initially gave a dollar, which is a small amount. The teens' behavior\u2014holding up the dollar sarcastically\u2014might have triggered the writer's reaction. The writer then took back the money, feeling that the approach was manipulative.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. Donations are usually voluntary. If someone feels pressured or manipulated into giving, they have the right to retract their donation. The writer's action could be seen as a response to feeling coerced. However, the method of taking back the money and shutting the door might be seen as confrontational. \n\nBut the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the writer felt the donation was made under false pretenses or manipulation, retracting it isn't necessarily wrong. However, the way it was done\u2014snatching the money and being rude\u2014could be seen as inappropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, the teens were acting on behalf of UNICEF, which generally is a reputable organization. However, if the teens misrepresented UNICEF's purpose with sarcasm, that's a different issue. The writer's anger might be justified if they felt tricked. \n\nThe main factors are the voluntariness of the donation and the appropriateness of the retraction method. If the writer felt they were deceived, they might have a point. But the manner of retraction could be seen as confrontational. However, since donations can be retracted at any time, the act itself isn't inherently wrong. The judgment might lean towards the writer not being in the wrong because they had the right to take back their donation, even if their approach was abrupt.\n"
