My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author was home on Halloween, giving out candy. Some teenagers came trick-or-treating and asked for a donation for UNICEF. The author gives them a dollar, but then the teens respond sarcastically, saying that dollar could feed a village, which the author finds insincere. The author then takes back the dollar, accuses them of guilt-tripping, and slams the door. Now, they're wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a situation where they felt pressured. The teens used a guilt-based approach, which the author found manipulative. The author then took back the donation because they felt it was being used as a trick. But was it right to take it back?\n\nLegally, once a donation is given, it belongs to the recipient. If the author took back the dollar immediately after giving it, maybe there's a question about whether it was a completed transaction. But morally, the situation is more about the interaction. The author might have felt misled or that the teens were exploiting a charitable cause inappropriately. However, UNICEF is a legitimate charity, even if individual collectors sometimes use strong tactics. \n\nThe author's reaction was strong\u2014physically taking back the money and being confrontational. While the author might have felt justified in their actions due to the perceived manipulation, they could be seen as inconsiderate of the cause, even if the delivery was poor. But the key here is the context of Halloween, where the usual expectation is to give candy, not money. The teens might have been misrepresenting the purpose of their request, blending it into a traditional candy-giving scenario.\n\nAlso, the author's initial donation was small, and they felt the teens were being sarcastic. Taking back the donation might be a reaction to the disrespect shown by the teens. However, the author's actions could be seen as invalidating a charitable cause because of the method used. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn the end, it's about whether the author had the right to reclaim the donation. Since the donation was made under pressure and immediate regret, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might hinge on the immediacy of the retraction and the context of the situation. But I need to decide between A and B. Considering the author's justification and the context, perhaps the answer is B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
