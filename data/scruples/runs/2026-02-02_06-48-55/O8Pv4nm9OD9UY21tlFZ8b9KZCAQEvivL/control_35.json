My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The situation involves them giving out candy on Halloween when their family went trick-or-treating. They encountered some older kids soliciting for UNICEF, and the way the teens acted was sarcastic. The person took their dollar back, felt bad, and is now asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The person gave a dollar to UNICEF through the teens, but then took it back because they felt it was a guilt trip. The main issue here is whether refunding a donation is wrong, especially when the donation was made under pressure.\n\nIn general, donating money is a voluntary act. If someone feels coerced or tricked into donating, they can reclaim their money. The fact that the teens used a sarcastic comment to highlight the minimal donation might have made the person feel embarrassed or forced. Taking back the money in that moment of anger might be understandable, but the method\u2014snatching it and slamming the door\u2014could be seen as rude.\n\nHowever, the person's actions might be justified if they felt the donation wasn't genuine. UNICEF's solicitation method here seems manipulative if the teens were exaggerating the impact of the dollar. The sarcasm could have been a way to mock small donations, which the person took offense to.\n\nLegal perspective: There's no legal obligation to keep a donation once given. The person has the right to take back their money if they feel it was given under false pretenses. Ethically, it's a bit more complex. If the teens were genuinely representing UNICEF and the donation was legitimate, taking it back might not be ethical. But if the approach was deceptive or manipulative, then the person's reaction could be justified.\n\nAlso, the context of Halloween is important. People are in a good mood to give, and being approached by older kids in a mocking way could disrupt that. The person's frustration might be valid, especially if they felt the teens were exploiting the situation for their own sake rather than genuinely helping UNICEF.\n\nAnother angle: The person admitted they felt like an asshole but justified their actions. The guilt they felt afterward suggests they might have doubted their decision. However, the initial reaction was based on feeling trapped and reacting to sarcasm. The key here is whether the donation was made under duress. If so, reclaiming it isn't unethical.\n\nIn conclusion, the person might not be in the wrong because they had the right to take back their donation if they felt it was given under pressure or manipulation. The method of taking it back was harsh, but their intent was to correct an action made under questionable circumstances. So, the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
