My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA story is in the wrong. They provided the story where the author took back a UNICEF donation after being approached by teenagers during Halloween.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was home alone giving out candy. The trick-or-treaters were older teens who asked for donations for UNICEF. The author gave a dollar, then took it back because of the sarcastic comment made by the teens, feeling manipulated. The author then shut the door, and now they're questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my perspective. So I need to analyze the situation from both angles.\n\nOn one hand, the author initially donated a dollar. Taking it back after giving it could be seen as rude or inconsiderate, especially if the teens were genuinely collecting for a charitable cause. Even if the teens were sarcastic, the author's reaction of snatching the money and yelling might be excessive. The author might have felt tricked, but reacting that way could be seen as aggressive.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt manipulated by the teens' guilt-tripping. The sarcastic remark might have triggered a defensive response, making the author feel disrespected. The author might have genuinely believed they were being taken advantage of, especially if the teens were not actually collecting for UNICEF but just using the cause as a way to get money. Also, the author pointed out that the teens were in a middle-class neighborhood, implying that maybe the approach was opportunistic.\n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, once the author gave the dollar, taking it back could be seen as wrong because it's a breach of trust. However, if the author felt forced or tricked into giving, then there's an argument that the donation wasn't voluntary. The key here is whether the donation was made under duress. The teens' sarcastic comment might have made the author feel pressured. But even so, the appropriate response would be to not give in the first place if they felt uncomfortable, rather than taking it back after the fact.\n\nAnother angle is the author's own admission that they felt like an asshole afterward. That suggests some self-awareness. However, the initial action might still be considered wrong regardless of subsequent feelings.\n\nAlso, the story mentions that the author was in a situation where they didn't have much money (only a dollar in their wallet). If the author felt that they were being asked for more than they could give, maybe the situation escalated because of the teens' approach.\n\nBut ultimately, once the money is given, taking it back could be seen as inconsiderate. The author could have refused to give in the first place if they felt uncomfortable. Taking back the money after might be more confrontational and inappropriate, regardless of the reason.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they retracted a donation after giving it, which is a bit of a breach of the initial agreement. Even if they felt pressured, the proper way to handle it would be to not give in the first place, not to take it back. The author's reaction, while understandable from a frustration standpoint, might not be the right way to handle the situation.\n"
