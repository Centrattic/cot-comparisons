My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The situation involves a Halloween scenario where the author was handing out candy and encountered teen trick-or-treaters soliciting for UNICEF.\n\nFirst, the author donated a dollar but then took it back because they felt manipulated by the teens' sarcastic comment. The key points here are the intent behind the donation, the reaction to perceived manipulation, and the act of retracting the donation.\n\nI need to consider if the author had the right to take back the donation. Once given, a donation is typically considered a gift, so the recipient can't be forced to return it. However, the author took the dollar back immediately after giving it, which might be a different scenario. The question is whether the initial donation was made under duress or coercion. The author mentions feeling \"trapped,\" but was that a valid reason?\n\nThe teenagers were representing UNICEF, which is a charitable organization. If they were misrepresenting the cause or using undue pressure, that's problematic. However, the author's response was to snatch the dollar back and shut the door. The sarcastic remark by the teens could be seen as mocking the donor, which might justify the author's reaction. But is it acceptable to retract a donation once it's been given?\n\nAlso, the author's argument is that the donation was for Halloween candy costs, which isn't the actual purpose of UNICEF. But the author chose to donate to UNICEF in that context. The teens might have been using a creative way to solicit funds, but if they misrepresented the cause, that's an issue.\n\nLegally, once a donation is given, the donor can't take it back unless there was a specific agreement. However, morally, if the donation was made under false pretenses or undue pressure, the author might feel justified. The situation's ambiguity lies in whether the teens' actions constituted coercion. The author's anger at the sarcasm and perceived guilt-tripping could be valid, but the act of taking back the money could be seen as rude or inconsiderate.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the community often looks at intentions and context. If the teens were indeed being sarcastic and manipulative, the author's reaction might be understandable. However, retracting a donation after it's been given might still be seen as improper, regardless of the reason. On the other hand, if the donation was made under false expectations (like being told it would feed a village when it's realistically not), the author could argue they were misled.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to perceived manipulation. If the teens misrepresented the donation's impact, the author isn't at fault. However, if they simply changed their mind after giving, that's different. The key is the teens' actions and the author's justified reaction to them. Given the sarcasm and the author's explanation about the actual purpose of the donation, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
