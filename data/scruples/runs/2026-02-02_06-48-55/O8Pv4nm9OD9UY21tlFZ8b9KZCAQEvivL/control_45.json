My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the wrong thing here. So, the situation is about Halloween trick-or-treating. The author stayed home to hand out candy while the family went out. Then, some teenagers showed up asking for a donation for UNICEF, saying their costumes were for that. The author gave a dollar but then took it back because they felt tricked by the sarcastic comment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a situation where they were expecting regular trick-or-treaters but these teenagers used the occasion to collect donations. The author felt pressured and then acted on impulse by taking back the dollar. The key points here might be about the right to withdraw a donation and the appropriateness of the author's response.\n\nDonations are usually voluntary. If someone gives money with the intention of it going to UNICEF, but then takes it back because they felt tricked, is that ethical? The author might argue that they were manipulated into giving, so revoking the donation is fair. On the other hand, once the money is given, it's part of a transaction. However, in this case, the donation wasn't processed through the organization's official channels; it was a direct handover. So maybe the author has the right to reclaim it if they realized they were misled.\n\nAnother angle is the behavior of the teenagers. Their sarcastic comment about feeding a village with a dollar might have been a tactic to provoke a reaction. The author's response was to snatch the dollar and insult them. That's confrontational and could be seen as rude, but given the provocation, maybe it's understandable.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The act of taking back the money isn't illegal, but the manner in which it was done might be questionable. The author felt guilt-tripped, which is a tactic some might find manipulative. However, the author's reaction was aggressive, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut considering the scenario, the author might have felt they were being exploited. The UNICEF collection during Halloween is a common practice, but the teenagers' approach here was particularly sarcastic and possibly deceptive. The author's decision to take back the donation could be justified as correcting the mistake of being pressured into giving under false pretenses. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if you're forced or tricked into a donation, you can retract it. The author's action, while harsh, might be a response to that pressure. The main issue is whether the author's public shaming and aggressive behavior were appropriate. However, the core question is about the donation itself. Since the author isn't in the wrong for revoking an ill-advised donation, especially when they were manipulated, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). The key is the justification for retracting the donation versus the manner of doing it. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the main point is the donation retraction, not the way they did it. So, the answer is B.\n"
