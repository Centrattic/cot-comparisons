My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person offered to stay home and hand out candy on Halloween while their family went trick-or-treating. They had a bowl of candy for kids. Then, some teenage trick-or-treaters came, said \"trick or treat for UNICEF,\" and tried to collect donations. The person had a dollar, gave it, but then took it back because they felt the UNICEF representatives were guilt-tripping them by implying the dollar could feed a village. The person felt trapped and sarcastic about it, so they snapped and took the dollar back.\n\nNow, the key points here: The person initially gave the dollar, then took it back. The question is if they're in the wrong for doing so. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if someone donates money, it's a voluntary act. If they take it back after giving it, that's a different matter. But in this case, the person took the dollar back immediately after giving it, possibly before the donation was finalized. So, legally, if the donation hasn't been processed yet, the person can retract it. However, socially, the situation is different. \n\nSocially, the person might be seen as inconsiderate because they publicly retracted their donation in front of the UNICEF representatives. That could be seen as embarrassing the representatives and possibly discouraging others from donating. On the other hand, the person felt manipulated and used guilt-tripping tactics. The UNICEF representatives might have overstepped by sarcastically saying the dollar could feed a village, which could have been perceived as insincere or mocking the donor's contribution. \n\nAnother angle is the immediacy of the retraction. If the person felt pressured, they could have refused to give the donation in the first place instead of giving and then taking it back. Taking it back after the fact might be seen as less respectful than just not donating at all. \n\nBut the person's argument is that they felt trapped and that UNICEF was exploiting the situation for guilt-tripping. They might believe their reaction was justified because they felt the representatives were using manipulative tactics. However, the act of taking back a donation, even if given under pressure, can be seen as rude or disrespectful, regardless of the initial pressure. \n\nSo, considering all this, the person might not be in the wrong because they felt coerced and responded in the moment. But socially, retracting a donation immediately could be frowned upon. However, since the donation was given and taken back quickly, it's possible that the person is not in the wrong. The key is whether the immediate retraction was a reasonable response to feeling manipulated. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be B (No), because the person felt they were being guilt-tripped and acted on impulse. However, there's an argument that they should have handled it differently, like not giving in the first place. But the immediate retraction might not make them the asshole if the pressure was inappropriate.\n"
