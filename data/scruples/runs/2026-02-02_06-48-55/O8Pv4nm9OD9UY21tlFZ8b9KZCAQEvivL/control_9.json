My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation is during Halloween, where they gave out candy while their family was trick-or-treating. Then, some teenagers came asking for donations for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping tactics. The writer felt pressured, gave a dollar, but then took it back because of the teens' sarcastic comments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality and morality here. Legally, once a donation is given, the recipient owns it. But the writer took it back, which might be a legal issue if the donation was already transferred. However, in practice, if someone takes back a donation immediately after giving it, maybe it's not enforceable. But the main focus here is on moral wrongdoing, not legal.\n\nMoral perspective: The writer was pressured by the teens using guilt-tripping. They gave a dollar but felt it was taken advantage of. The writer's reaction was strong, confronting the teens and taking the dollar back. The key points here are the intent of the writer and the actions taken. \n\nThe writer might argue they were acting on being manipulated and correcting their mistake. However, the act of taking back the money after giving it could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the teens were acting on behalf of a charity. But the teens' behavior was sarcastic and possibly deceptive, which might justify the writer's frustration.\n\nAnother angle: Charities often use emotional appeals, but if the method is manipulative or deceptive, the donor isn't obligated to continue the donation. The writer might have overreacted by taking the money back and shutting the door, but their reasoning is based on feeling tricked.\n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? It depends on whether the charity's approach was legitimate. If the teens misrepresented UNICEF's cause or used coercion, the writer's reaction is understandable. However, taking back the donation immediately might not be the best approach, but morally, if they felt deceived, they might not be in the wrong. The question is about whether the writer is at fault, not justifying their actions but whether they were wrong.\n\nIn the AITA context, people often consider intentions and context. The writer acted in the moment, possibly out of anger. The charity collectors might have overstepped, but the writer's action of taking the money back might be seen as inconsiderate. However, if they felt manipulated, they could argue they were correcting a mistake. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because they were reacting to a perceived manipulation, but some might say they should have handled it differently. But the key is whether they are \"in the wrong,\" so if the manipulation was real, they're not at fault. If the manipulation wasn't there, maybe they are. The story says the teens were sarcastic and trapped them, so the writer's reaction is justified. So answer B.\n"
