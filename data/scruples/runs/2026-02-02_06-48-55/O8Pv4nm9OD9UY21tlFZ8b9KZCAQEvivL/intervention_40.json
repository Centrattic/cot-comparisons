My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation involves Halloween trick-or-treating where they gave a dollar to some teens who were collecting for UNICEF. The teens were being sarcastic when they said the dollar could feed a village. The person got angry and took back the dollar, slammed the door, and now feels bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a situation where they were approached by teens, possibly high schoolers, during Halloween. They were giving out candy, and the teens were collecting donations. The author had a one-dollar bill and gave it, but the teens responded sarcastically. The author felt their intent was being mocked, so they reclaimed the dollar.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions and their justification. The teens used a sarcastic tone, which might be seen as mocking the donor's generosity. The author felt tricked into donating more than they intended because the teens used a guilt-tripping tactic. When confronted with the sarcastic remark, the author retracted the donation. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, when you make a donation, it's typically a voluntary act. However, if the donor feels pressured or misled, they might have the right to retract it. The author retracted the donation upon realizing they were being mocked, which could be seen as a reasonable reaction to the manipulation. \n\nOn the other hand, once a donation is given, the recipient has a right to it. The author taking back the dollar might be seen as inappropriate because they had already handed it over. However, the context here is that the donation was given in a moment of pressure and then retracted immediately upon realizing the sarcasm. The immediate retraction could be justified as correcting a hasty decision made under pressure.\n\nAnother angle is the intent behind the UNICEF collection. If the teens were indeed using guilt-tripping tactics to get more money, the author's reaction could be seen as standing up against manipulation. However, the act of taking back the donation could be considered impolite or even theft if the donation had already been received. But since it was a small amount and done in the heat of the moment, maybe the ethical judgment is more nuanced.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if someone feels they were coerced into a donation, they might have the right to retract it. The author's reaction was an emotional response to feeling manipulated. However, the act of snatching the dollar and slamming the door might be seen as aggressive. But the key factor here is whether the author had the right to retract the donation once it was given. \n\nIn many cases, donations can be retracted if given under duress or misunderstanding. Since the author felt they were being tricked into giving more than they intended, retracting the donation could be justified. However, the method of doing so\u2014physically taking back the money\u2014might be considered rude or confrontational. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action might be ethically defensible because they were responding to perceived manipulation. However, the method of retraction could be seen as inappropriate. The core issue is whether the donation was given under false pretenses, and if so, the author might not be in the wrong for correcting that. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
