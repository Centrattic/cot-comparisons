My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author gave out Halloween candy while their family was away. Teenagers came trick-or-treating but asked for a donation for UNICEF instead of taking candy. They used a sarcastic comment about a dollar feeding a village. The author took back the dollar, called them out for guilt-tripping, and slammed the door.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is wrong. The key points here are consent and the nature of the donation. The author gave the dollar initially, but the context was that the teens were using guilt-tripping tactics. The author felt pressured and decided to retract the donation. \n\nIn terms of legality, once money is given, it's typically considered a completed transaction. So taking it back could be problematic. However, the situation here is more about social norms and expectations. If the donation was made under duress or manipulation, the author might have a case in terms of feeling violated. But legally, they might not have grounds to take it back. \n\nSocially, some might argue that the author overreacted, especially since they admitted feeling guilty afterward. Others might side with the author for standing up against what they perceived as manipulation. The teens' sarcastic remarks could be seen as exploiting the situation, which might justify the author's actions from a moral standpoint. \n\nHowever, the act of taking back the donation after it was given could be seen as rude or aggressive. The author's method of reclaiming the money was confrontational, which might make others view them as at fault. \n\nConsidering all factors, while there might be some justification for feeling pressured, the act of taking back the donation could be seen as wrong because it's not typical to retract a given gift, even if under duress. So the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong), but there's nuance here. Alternatively, if the donation was made under false pretenses or pressure, maybe B. But generally, once given, a donation is final. So probably A.\n"
