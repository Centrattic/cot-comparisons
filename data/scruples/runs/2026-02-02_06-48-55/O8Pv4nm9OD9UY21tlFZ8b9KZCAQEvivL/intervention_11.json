My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author donated $1 to UNICEF through trick-or-treaters who were collecting for them. The donation was given, but then the author took it back when they felt the collection was manipulative or guilt-tripping. \n\nSo, the key points here. Legally, once a donation is given, even if it's in person, it's considered a completed transaction. If you give someone money, you can't just take it back unless there's some agreement or fraud involved. The author took the money back, which could be seen as theft or a breach of the donation agreement.\n\nMoral aspect: The author felt wronged by the method of collection, which involved guilt-tripping. However, the author chose to give the money initially, even if under pressure. Taking it back might be seen as impulsive, but the motive was based on feeling manipulated. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, yes, because they took back a donation that was already given. Morally, it's more nuanced. The author might feel justified if they believed the collection was deceptive. However, the act of taking the money back could have been handled differently, like not giving in the first place or confronting them without physically taking the money back.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author might argue that the donation was made under duress, but that's a stretch unless there was actual coercion. The trick-or-treaters were part of a recognized charity, so the author's reaction might be seen as impulsive rather than justified. \n\nIn conclusion, the author likely is in the wrong because they took back a donation after already giving it, which isn't typically allowed unless there's a specific reason. The moral justification for their actions might be debatable, but legally and ethically, the act of retrieving the donation after the fact is problematic.\n"
