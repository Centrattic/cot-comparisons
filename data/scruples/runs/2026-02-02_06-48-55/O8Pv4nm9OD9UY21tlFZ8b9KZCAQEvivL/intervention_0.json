My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The person stayed home to hand out candy on Halloween. Some teenage trick-or-treaters approached them, asked for a donation for UNICEF, and made a sarcastic comment about the dollar being able to feed a village. The writer felt trapped, gave a dollar, then took it back because they felt the kids were being sarcastic and manipulative. They shut the door and later felt guilty.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the kids approached during a social event where people are typically giving out candy. The author offered candy, but the kids switched to a donation request. The sarcastic remark might have been provocative, making the author feel tricked. The author then took back the money, which could be seen as rude, especially if the donation was already given. But maybe the author felt manipulated, so taking back the money was a reaction to that.\n\nOn the other hand, once a donation is given, it's generally considered a completed transaction. Taking it back after the fact could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the person felt pressured. The author's response was harsh, shutting the door and not allowing the kids to respond. However, the initial approach by the kids was pushy and sarcastic, which might have justified the author's frustration.\n\nUNICEF's collection methods might involve student volunteers, and sometimes they use dramatic tactics to get donations, which could be seen as part of their strategy. But the author might have felt that the kids were taking advantage of the situation, using Halloween as a way to guilt-trip people.\n\nThe key points are whether the author had the right to retract a donation once given, and whether the kids' approach was appropriate. If the donation was made in a pressured situation, maybe the author is within their rights to take it back. However, socially, once you give, it's usually expected to let it stand, even if you later regret it. So the author's action might be seen as inconsiderate, hence in the wrong.\n\nBut if the kids were being sarcastic and manipulative, the author's reaction could be a justifiable response to feeling tricked. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on whether retracting a donation is acceptable when the donation was made under duress.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people usually don't retract donations unless there's fraud or some other issue. Here, the situation is more about perceived manipulation. So the author might be in the wrong for taking back the money, even if they felt pressured. Alternatively, if the pressure was undue, maybe not. But generally, once given, a donation is a gift, so taking it back could be seen as wrong.\n"
