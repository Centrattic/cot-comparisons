My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person stayed home to hand out Halloween candy while their family went out. Then two teenagers showed up asking for donations for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping tactics. The person gave a dollar, which the teens mocked, so they snatched it back and slammed the door.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think about the key points here.\n\nThe person gave a dollar, which they later took back when they felt they were being mocked. The teens were using a guilt-trip, which the author found manipulative. The author's reaction was to take back the donation and leave. \n\nI need to consider if the author had the right to take back the money. Once a donation is given, can it be taken back? In general, donations are considered gifts, so once given, they belong to the recipient. However, in this case, the author took back the money immediately. If the donation hasn't been transferred yet\u2014like if the author gave the dollar and then took it back before the teens had it\u2014it might not be a completed transaction. \n\nBut the author's main issue was the manipulation by the teens. The author felt that the teens were exploiting Halloween for a different cause, using guilt-tripping. The author's reaction was emotional and confrontational. Was that justified? Maybe the author could have refused to donate in the first place instead of taking back the money after giving it.\n\nBut if the author didn't want to donate, they could have just said no. By giving the dollar, they might have felt pressured later. However, the initial donation was small, and the author's anger at the manipulation could be understandable. The key here is whether taking back the money was acceptable. If the donation was given but then taken back immediately, perhaps it's not a completed transaction. \n\nAnother angle: The teens' behavior was sarcastic and disrespectful. The author's reaction, while confrontational, might be seen as a response to that disrespect. But taking back the money could be seen as stealing if the donation was already given. However, since it was immediate, maybe it's not considered theft. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the author might feel they were manipulated, but the act of taking back the money could be seen as rude or even petty. However, if the author felt deceived, there's an argument for their side. \n\nHmm. The answer might hinge on whether the donation was a completed transaction. If the author gave the dollar and then took it back, maybe it's not a valid donation yet. But if the teens had already received it, taking it back could be problematic. The story says the author \"snatched the dollar from him,\" implying it was taken back before it was fully transferred. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the donation wasn't finalized. \n\nAlso, the author's parents support the neighborhood giving candy, so the author might have felt the teens were hijacking that good deed for a different cause. The manipulation aspect is key here. The author might feel they were pressured into giving, which isn't ethical. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because they were responding to manipulation and the donation wasn't completed. Answer B: No.\n"
