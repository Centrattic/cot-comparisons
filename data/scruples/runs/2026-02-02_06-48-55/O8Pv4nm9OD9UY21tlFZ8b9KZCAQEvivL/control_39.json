My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. So, the situation involves Halloween trick-or-treating where the family usually gives out candy. The author stayed home and encountered teenagers asking for donations for UNICEF. The kids used guilt-tripping tactics, and the author felt pressured, gave a dollar, then took it back when they realized the approach was manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Donations are typically voluntary. If someone feels coerced, they have the right to retract their donation. The author did give the dollar initially but then took it back because they felt tricked. The key points are the use of guilt-tripping by the teens and the author's reaction. \n\nThe author might argue that they were manipulated into donating under false pretenses. The sarcastic comment about feeding a village with a single dollar could be seen as mocking the donor, leading to the author's frustration. However, the author did give the dollar first, then took it back. Legally, once a donation is given, taking it back might be an issue, but ethically, if the donation was made under duress or deception, it's a gray area.\n\nOn the other hand, the teens were acting on behalf of UNICEF, but if they exaggerated or used sarcasm to pressure donors, that's problematic. The author's response was to snatch the money back and call them out. Was that justified? Depending on the situation, the author had the right to feel disrespected and choose not to support that method, but physically taking back the donation could be seen as confrontational. \n\nUNICEF as an organization might not endorse the teens' tactics. The author's action might not be in the wrong because they were reacting to perceived manipulation. However, the act of taking back the money after it was given could be seen as rude or impolite, even if the initial donation was made under pressure. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong in retracting the donation. Legally, once given, it's a completed transaction, but ethically, if the donation was coerced, the author had a right to withdraw. The sarcasm and guilt-tripping from the teens might justify the author's actions. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
