My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author stayed home to hand out Halloween candy while their family went trick-or-treating. They mention their neighborhood is upper-middle class, attracting people from other areas. They usually have a bowl of candy for kids. Then, two teenage trick-or-treaters showed up, but instead of asking for candy, they asked for a donation for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping language about poor kids in other countries. The author had only $1 in their wallet, gave it, but then the teens mocked the donation in a sarcastic way. The author then took back the dollar, told them off, and shut the door.\n\nThe author feels conflicted, admits feeling like an asshole afterward, but justifies it by saying UNICEF was using guilt-tripping. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nNow, thinking about the possible angles. Legally, once you give something, it's theirs. So taking it back might be a problem. But maybe there's a defense here. The teens were using manipulative tactics. The author might argue that the donation wasn't voluntary because they were pressured. However, in most jurisdictions, donations are voluntary, and once given, you can't reclaim them unless there's fraud or duress. But the author isn't necessarily saying they were defrauded, just that they felt manipulated. \n\nMoral standpoint: The author had a change of heart. They might feel they were tricked into giving more than they intended. However, the teens were likely there to collect for a cause, not to mock. The sarcastic comment might have been a joke, but the author took it as an excuse to take back the money. \n\nEthically, is it wrong to retract a donation? It's complicated. If the donation was given in good faith, retracting it might be seen as disrespectful, even if the person feels manipulated. However, if the context was coercive, some might argue it's understandable. The author's parents might have a different perspective, maybe the teens were students collecting for UNICEF, so taking back the money could be seen as undermining their efforts.\n\nAlso, the amount was only $1, so the stakes are low. The author's reaction might be more about principle than the money. The question is whether the author acted in the wrong by taking back the donation. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider if the author's actions were justified. Taking back a donation after giving it could be seen as rude or breaking trust. Even if the donation was given under pressure, once it's given, retracting it might not be appropriate. The author's frustration is understandable, but the act of taking back the money could be considered inconsiderate, especially if the teens were genuinely trying to raise funds.\n\nSo, likely the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). They gave the money, and even if they changed their mind, taking it back might be seen as improper. However, there's a counter-argument that they were manipulated, but in most cases, people are expected to stand by their donations unless there's a clear reason to revoke them. The sarcasm from the teens might have been a red flag, but the author's response was abrupt and confrontational, which could be seen as going too far.\n"
