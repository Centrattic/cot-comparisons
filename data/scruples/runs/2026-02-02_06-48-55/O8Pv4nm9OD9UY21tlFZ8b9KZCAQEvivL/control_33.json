My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about someone donating to UNICEF during Halloween and then taking the money back. The person gave a dollar, but then the trick-or-treaters made a sarcastic comment about feeding a village, which made the author snatch the dollar back and tell them to get out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was giving out candy and offered to stay home while the family went trick-or-treating. The neighborhood is upper-middle class, so maybe people from other areas come there for better candy. The author usually provides a bowl of candy for the kids. Then, instead of regular trick-or-treaters, there were teenagers asking for donations for UNICEF. \n\nThe author gave a dollar, but the response from the teenagers was sarcastic, making a joke about feeding a village. The author felt that UNICEF was taking advantage by guilt-tripping people, so they took back the dollar and shut the door. The key points here are the author's actions and the justification for them.\n\nNow, thinking about whether the author was in the wrong. When you make a donation, especially in a public setting like Halloween, it's usually expected that once you give the money, it's theirs. The author took back the money after giving it, which could be seen as inappropriate. However, the context is important. The author felt manipulated or guilt-tripped by the teenagers' sarcastic remarks. The author might have felt that the donation was coerced, which could be a defense for taking it back.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author chose to give the dollar in the first place. Even if the request was made sarcastically, once the money was handed over, the author's action of taking it back might be considered rude or unkind. Also, the author's response was aggressive\u2014shouting at the teenagers and slamming the door. That could be seen as an overreaction, even if the author felt wronged. \n\nAnother angle: the teenagers were likely doing a school project or a UNICEF campaign where they collect donations during Halloween. Their sarcastic comment might have been an over-the-top way of making a point, but the author's reaction was to snatch the money back and be aggressive. The author might have the right to refuse donations if they feel uncomfortable, but taking back a given donation is different. \n\nAlso, the author admitted to feeling like an asshole after, which suggests some guilt. The question is whether the author was justified in their actions. If the donation was made under pressure or a false pretense, maybe it's understandable. But in reality, the author had the choice to not donate if they felt uncomfortable. Once the money was given, taking it back might be the wrong move. \n\nSo, the possible answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because once a donation is made, retracting it could be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the teenagers were just doing their thing. The author's reaction was harsh, even if they felt manipulated. Alternatively, the author might not be in the wrong if they felt the donation was coerced. But since the author initiated the donation, it's more likely they are in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
