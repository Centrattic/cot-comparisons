My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation involves Halloween trick-or-treating where the author gave out candy and ended up giving a dollar to some teenagers who asked for a UNICEF donation. The teenagers then mocked the dollar, so the author took it back and shut the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions and intentions of both parties. The author initially gave the dollar, which was a donation. The teenagers then acted sarcastically, which probably made the author uncomfortable. The author then took back the money and confronted them. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author have the right to take back the donation once it was given? In most cases, once you give money, it's considered a completed transaction, especially in a charitable context. However, the context here is a bit different because the donation was solicited in a way that the author found manipulative or guilt-tripping. \n\nThe author felt trapped during the donation request, which might have influenced their state of mind. The teenagers' sarcastic remarks could have made the author feel that the donation wasn't appreciated or was being mocked. So the author took back the money as a reaction to that perceived insincerity. \n\nHowever, taking back the donation after it's been given is where the ethical question comes in. The author might not have the right to reclaim the money once it's been handed over, regardless of the recipient's behavior. On the other hand, the author's frustration with the manipulation tactics used by the solicitation could be seen as a valid reason. \n\nAnother angle is the intent behind the donation. If the author donated under a sense of obligation or guilt, perhaps the donation wasn't genuine. The author might feel that the donation was coerced, which could justify retracting it. But legally and ethically, once the money is given, it's theirs to keep unless there's a prior agreement. \n\nThe author's response was confrontational, which might have been inappropriate. However, the initial solicitation's methods could be at fault here. The teenagers' sarcastic remarks might have crossed a line, making the author's reaction understandable, though not necessarily correct. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author might be in the wrong because they gave the money and then took it back, which could be seen as dishonest. But if the donation was made under duress, the author's action could be justified as retracting a coerced donation. \n\nThere's also the aspect of how the author perceived the UNICEF solicitation. The author's comment about third-world countries not celebrating Halloween suggests a misunderstanding of UNICEF's mission, which might have contributed to their frustration. However, that doesn't excuse the action of taking back the donation. \n\nI need to weigh these factors. The main issue is whether the author's action of retracting a donation once given is wrong. Ethically, once you give money, especially in a charitable context, there's an expectation that it's a final action. However, if the donation was given under false pretenses or manipulation, it might be different. \n\nIn this case, the teenagers' behavior might have made the author feel manipulated, but does that negate the donation? The author's decision to take back the money could be seen as a mistake because the donation was already given. The author might not have the right to retract it, regardless of the recipient's behavior. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because they took back the donation after it was given, even if they felt misled. The proper course of action would have been to not give the donation in the first place if they felt uncomfortable or manipulated. Taking it back after the fact is ethically questionable.\n"
