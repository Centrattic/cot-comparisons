My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took back their UNICEF donation was in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the scenario: The person stayed home to give out Halloween candy. When some older trick-or-treaters asked for donations for UNICEF, they gave a dollar, but then the teens mocked the donation. The person got upset and took back the dollar, telling them to leave. Now they're questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here. The person donated a dollar, which they later felt was manipulated. The teens used guilt-tripping, which the person found offensive. They then took back the money and shut the door. \n\nFrom the person's perspective, they felt tricked into donating because of the UNICEF angle. The sarcastic comment from the teens made them feel that their donation was being mocked. They decided to retract the donation because they believed it wasn't for the right reasons.\n\nBut legally, once you give a donation, it's a completed transaction. You can't just take it back unless there's a specific agreement. However, morally, it's different. If the donation was made under false pretenses or manipulation, that's a gray area. The person might argue that they were pressured into giving, but that's not always a valid reason to take it back. \n\nOn the other hand, the UNICEF collectors might be doing their job as per their organization's instructions. They collect donations during Halloween, and maybe the teens were just following directions. The sarcastic comment complicates things; maybe they were acting out, but the organization's intent is to raise funds for a good cause. \n\nThe person's reaction was impulsive. They took back the money and confronted the teens. While their feelings are understandable, physically taking back the money might not be acceptable. There's a difference between expressing dissatisfaction and taking action to retrieve a given donation. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a tough call. Legally, the person might be in the wrong because they can't just take back a donation. Morally, if the donation was obtained through manipulative tactics, maybe the person has a point. But the act of taking the money back could be seen as rude or aggressive. \n\nAlso, the person's parents live in an upper-middle-class area where people from other places come for candy. The person supports that but felt the UNICEF collectors were exploiting the situation. The person's frustration might stem from feeling that the collectors were using guilt to get money from people who were just being generous with candy. \n\nBut in the end, the person did donate willingly, even if they later regretted it. Taking back the money after the fact, regardless of the reason, might not be the right approach. They could have chosen to not donate in the first place or explained their feelings without retrieving the dollar. \n\nSo considering all this, the person might be in the wrong because once a donation is made, retracting it isn't typically acceptable unless there's a specific policy. The situation is complicated by the manipulation felt, but the action of taking back the money is where the issue lies. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong), but there are nuances here.\n"
