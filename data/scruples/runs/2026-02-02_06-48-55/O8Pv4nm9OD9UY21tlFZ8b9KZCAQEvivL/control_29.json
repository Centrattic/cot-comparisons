My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The situation is about a Halloween scenario where the author gave a dollar to UNICEF trick-or-treaters but then took it back due to the teens' sarcastic remarks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a position where they offered to stay home and give out candy. The teens showed up for UNICEF, not candy. The author gave a dollar but felt manipulated when the teens mocked the donation. Then they took back the dollar, which is the main issue here.\n\nLegally, once a donation is given, it belongs to the recipient unless there's a specific agreement otherwise. The author took back the dollar immediately after giving it, so technically, it's a revocation of the donation. However, if the teens had already accepted the dollar, the author might not have the legal right to take it back. But in this case, the author snatched it back before the teens could leave, so maybe it's still considered a valid revocation.\n\nEthically, the question is more complex. The author felt tricked into donating because of the guilt-tripping. The teens' sarcastic comments might have crossed a line, making the situation uncomfortable. However, the author could have refused to donate in the first place instead of taking back the money. Also, UNICEF's trick-or-treating program is a known method to collect donations, so maybe the author's reaction was to the teens' tone rather than UNICEF itself.\n\nThe key points are: Was the author's reaction justified? Did they overstep by taking back the dollar? Did the teens have a right to continue with the donation after it was given? Also, the author's argument about the donation amount versus candy cost might not be relevant here since the teens weren't collecting for candy.\n\nIn terms of social norms, people might feel that once you give a donation, you can't take it back, especially if it's a public act. But if the donation was given under duress or the donor felt pressure, maybe they have a reason to retract. However, the appropriate response would be to not donate rather than take back money once given.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They gave the dollar, then took it back. That might be seen as rude or inappropriate, especially if the teens were following UNICEF's instructions. But if the teens were mocking the donation, maybe the author had a reason. Still, physically snatching the money could be seen as aggressive. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions were justified given the context of the interaction.\n"
