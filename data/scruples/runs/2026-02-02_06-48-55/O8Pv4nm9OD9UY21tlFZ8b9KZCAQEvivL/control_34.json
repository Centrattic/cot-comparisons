My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The situation involves a Halloween scenario where the author gave $1 to UNICEF trick-or-treaters but then took it back after feeling manipulated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of donations and how they're solicited. Donations are typically voluntary, so if someone donates and later decides to take it back, there might be implications. However, UNICEF is a legitimate organization, and their collection methods, even if part of a school program, are supposed to be ethical.\n\nThe author felt guilt-tripped and sarcastic comments from the teens contributed to their decision to retract the donation. The key point is whether the author had the right to take back the money after giving it. Once a donation is made, it becomes the recipient's property, so taking it back might not be possible. However, if the donation was made under false pretenses or undue pressure, there might be an argument for reclaiming it. But in practice, once the money changes hands, it's difficult to reverse.\n\nAlso, the tone of the UNICEF collectors was sarcastic, which could be unprofessional. But the teens were likely following a script or acting on their own, which doesn't negate the legitimacy of UNICEF's cause. The author's reaction was based on feeling manipulated, but the responsibility might lie with the collectors for the approach they used rather than the author for withdrawing the donation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might not be in the wrong if they felt coerced, but legally and ethically, once a donation is given, retracting it isn't straightforward. However, the context is important here. If the collection method was inappropriate, the fault might lie more with the collectors than the donor. The author's anger is understandable given the situation, but taking back a donation after it's been given could be seen as problematic unless there were extenuating circumstances.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author felt manipulated and the collectors' approach was inappropriate. However, there's a nuance here about the finality of donations, but in this context, the emotional reaction and the circumstances might justify the author's actions.\n"
