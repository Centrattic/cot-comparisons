My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the writer was alone giving out candy on Halloween. Their parents' neighborhood is upper middle class, so lots of trick-or-treaters come. The writer usually has a bowl of candy. Then, two teenage trick-or-treaters come and ask for a donation for UNICEF, saying it's for kids in poor countries. The writer gives a dollar but then takes it back when the teens mock it, saying it could feed a village sarcastically. The writer then grabs the dollar, comments on the cost of the candy versus the donation, and shuts the door.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the writer donated $1, then took it back after the teens were sarcastic. The question is whether the writer was wrong to do so.\n\nFirst, think about the initial donation. The writer gave $1, which is their choice. But then, when the teens mocked the donation, the writer took it back. Is that justified? The writer felt tricked into donating because of guilt-tripping. The teens might have been using a tactic to make people feel like they need to give more, even if it's a small amount. The writer's reaction was to take back the dollar because they felt it was an insincere way to get donations.\n\nFrom one angle, the writer had the right to retract the donation if they realized they didn't want to give it. Donations are voluntary, and the writer may have felt pressured. However, taking back the money after giving it might be seen as rude or inconsiderate, especially if the teens were just doing their job. But the writer's perspective is that the approach was manipulative, using guilt-tripping tactics.\n\nAnother angle is that the teens might have been high schoolers collecting donations as part of a school project or charity event. They might not have been being sarcastic intentionally but just excited about the donation. The writer misinterpreted their tone. However, the story says the teens used a sarcastic tone, so the writer's reaction is based on that.\n\nAlso, the writer points out that the money given for candy is more impactful locally than the donation, which might be a valid point. But the issue is whether taking back the donation is acceptable.\n\nIn terms of ethics, if someone donates under a certain belief and then realizes they were misled, they might feel justified in retracting the donation. However, in practice, once a donation is given, especially in person, taking it back might be seen as abrupt or inconsiderate. But the writer felt manipulated, so their reaction is more about standing up for themselves.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the writer's decision to take back the donation was wrong. If the donation was made under pressure or guilt-tripping, then retracting it isn't wrong. However, if the writer overreacted to the teens' comments and the donation was a genuine choice, then it's wrong.\n\nIn this case, the writer felt trapped and later realized the donation was a tactic. The teens' sarcastic remark might have been a way to highlight the impact of the donation, but the writer took offense. So, the writer's action could be defended as correcting a mistake, hence not in the wrong. Alternatively, if the teens were just doing their job and the writer overreacted, then the writer is in the wrong.\n\nI think the key here is the perception of being guilt-tripped. The writer felt manipulated, so taking back the donation makes sense. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
