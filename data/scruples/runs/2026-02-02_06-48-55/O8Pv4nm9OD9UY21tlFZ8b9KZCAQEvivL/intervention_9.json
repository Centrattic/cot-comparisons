My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation involves a Halloween setup where the writer gave out candy and had teenagers come by asking for donations for UNICEF. The writer felt pressured, gave a dollar, but then took it back because of the sarcastic comment from the teenagers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer was in a situation where they were approached by UNICEF representatives during Halloween. The teenagers used a trick-or-treat approach to solicit donations, which the writer found manipulative. The writer gave a dollar, but upon hearing the sarcastic remark, took it back. \n\nNow, the key points here are: Was the writer morally wrong to retract the donation? The UNICEF collectors approached during a time when people are expecting to give candy, not donations. The writer might feel that the method of solicitation was guilt-tripping, which they found unethical. However, once the donation was given, even if it was under pressure, taking it back could be seen as dishonest. \n\nBut wait, the writer immediately took back the dollar. The act of giving charity is usually voluntary, but if someone feels coerced, they might have a right to retract the donation. Also, the teenagers' behavior was inappropriate and manipulative, which could justify the writer's reaction. However, in terms of etiquette, taking back a donation after it's been given might be considered rude or inconsiderate, especially in a public setting. \n\nAnother angle: The writer's action could be seen as a stand against manipulative tactics. They might not be in the wrong if they felt the collection method was unethical. However, the act of snatching back the money might have been impulsive and could have been handled more politely. \n\nBut the main question is whether they are in the wrong. If we consider that the donation was given under pressure, the writer might have the right to retract it. However, in social interactions, once a donation is given, even if it's later regretted, taking it back might be seen as improper. \n\nSo, there's a balance between the ethical collection practices and the writer's right to retract a donation given under coercion. The answer might depend on cultural norms and what's considered appropriate in such situations. The writer's actions are understandable given the context, but whether it's morally wrong is debatable. \n\nIn conclusion, the writer might not be entirely in the wrong because they felt pressured and the collectors' approach was inappropriate. However, taking back the donation after it was given could be seen as inconsiderate. But overall, the situation is more about the collectors' tactics being the issue rather than the writer's reaction. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a standard for retracting donations.\n"
