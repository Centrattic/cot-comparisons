My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation is during Halloween when the author was handing out candy. Teenagers came asking for donations for UNICEF, and there was some sarcastic remarks from the teens. The author took back the dollar, shut the door, and later felt bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a position where they were approached by teenagers, possibly in a way that felt manipulative. The key points here are the approach by the UNICEF representatives (assuming the teens were part of a UNICEF campaign) and the author's reaction. \n\nThe author gave a dollar but then took it back because the teens were sarcastic. The reasoning is that the teens were using guilt-tripping tactics. But wait, UNICEF often uses campaigns like the Halloween for UNICEF program where kids collect donations. The author might have felt pressured, but taking back the money after giving it could be seen as rude or abrupt. \n\nThe question is whether the author's reaction was justified. On one hand, the teens' behavior was inappropriate with the sarcastic comments, which could have been mocking the donor. On the other hand, the author had a change of heart but didn't have the right to take back the money once it was given. \n\nAlso, the author's comment about the cost of candy vs. the UNICEF donation might be a bit off. The UNICEF donation is for a good cause, and the teens might have been overstepping with their tone. However, the act of taking back the money could be considered disrespectful, even if the initial approach was problematic. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, once a donation is given, it's generally considered a completed transaction. The author could have refused to donate in the first place if they felt uncomfortable. Taking back the money after the fact might not be the right approach, even if the solicitation was done in a questionable way. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the teens' behavior. If they were being sarcastic and mocking, maybe the author felt disrespected, which could influence their reaction. It's a tricky situation because both sides have some issues. The author's frustration with the guilt-tripping tactics is understandable, but the method of handling it (snatching the money and shutting the door) was probably not the best approach. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for taking back the donation, but there's some nuance because of the teens' inappropriate behavior. However, the act of retracting the donation isn't typical and could be seen as inconsiderate. The right approach would have been to not donate if the approach was uncomfortable, but once given, taking it back is different. \n\nI think the author is partially at fault because they didn't have the right to take back the money after giving it, even if they felt pressured. The correct action would be to politely decline the donation if they felt uncomfortable, but taking it back later is not appropriate. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
