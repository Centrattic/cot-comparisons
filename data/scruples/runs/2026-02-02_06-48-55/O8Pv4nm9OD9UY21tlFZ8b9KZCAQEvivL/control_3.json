My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author gave out Halloween candy while their family was away. Some older trick-or-treaters asked for donations for UNICEF, using a guilt-trip tactic. The author had only a dollar, gave it, but then the teens acted sarcastically, which made the author snatch the dollar back and shut the door. The author feels conflicted about their reaction.\n\nSo, the key points here are free will in donations and the ethics of the situation. When someone asks for a donation, the donor is supposed to decide freely whether to contribute and how much. The UNICEF collectors here might have used guilt-tripping, which is a common criticism of certain fundraising tactics. The author felt pressured and then reacted strongly when they felt disrespected.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If someone donates under pressure and then changes their mind, can they take back the donation? Legally, once a donation is given, it's a completed transaction. But ethically, it's more nuanced. The author felt manipulated, which might justify their reaction, especially since the collectors were teenagers acting disrespectfully.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author shouldn't have given the money in the first place if they felt pressured. But others might say that the collectors' sarcastic remarks were inappropriate, making the author's response understandable. The key factor here is the pressure and the unethical tactics used by the collectors, which could exonerate the author.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author's actions were a reaction to perceived manipulation and disrespect. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the donation wasn't voluntary, and the collectors' actions were problematic.\n"
