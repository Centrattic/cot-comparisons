My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The author wrote about a situation where they gave a dollar to some teenagers collecting for UNICEF during Halloween, but then the teens were sarcastic, leading the author to snatch the dollar back and shut the door.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author was trick-or-treating and gave a dollar, but the collectors were being sarcastic and maybe even manipulative. The author felt trapped and then took back the money. The question is whether that was wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they're curious. Let me break it down. On one hand, the author gave the money initially, which might imply a donation. But then the collectors' behavior was inappropriate, using guilt-tripping and sarcasm. The author felt pressured and then changed their mind. \n\nSo, in terms of legal or ethical responsibility, once a donation is given, the donor can't typically reclaim it. But this isn't a straightforward donation because the collectors might have misrepresented the cause. The author might have felt misled, which complicates things. However, the author's reaction was to snatch the money back in a confrontational way, which could be seen as rude or aggressive.\n\nBut then again, the collectors' approach was questionable. They used a guilt trip by implying the dollar could feed a village, which might be an exaggeration. The author's reaction was emotional, but maybe justified because they felt manipulated. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action of taking back the money might be seen as unethical because they had already donated. However, the context of the collectors' behavior could mitigate that. It's a bit of a gray area. The author might have the right to refuse donation if they realize they were misled, but the method was harsh. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because donations are generally final, and taking back the money after giving it, even if upset, could be seen as wrong. But some might argue the collectors were at fault. However, the author's approach was aggressive, so maybe A is correct.\n"
