My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation involves the author giving Halloween candy to trick-or-treaters while their family was out. Then, some teenagers came asking for a UNICEF donation, using guilt-tripping tactics. The author gave a dollar but was annoyed by the teenagers' sarcastic reaction and took the money back, telling them to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a position where they were giving out candy, and the teenagers approached with a different request. The key points here are the author's actions and the teenagers' behavior. The author felt pressured, which led to giving a dollar they didn't want to give. Then, when the teenagers acted mockingly, the author snapped and took the money back.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, taking back a donation after it's been given is generally frowned upon because it's considered a breach of trust. However, there's nuance here. The author didn't donate out of genuine willingness; they were pressured. The teenagers used guilt-tripping and sarcasm, which might have been provocative. But once the donation was made, even if reluctantly, taking it back could be seen as rude or disrespectful, especially if the teenagers were acting on behalf of a legitimate cause like UNICEF.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had the right to refuse the donation altogether. They chose to give a dollar, but when the recipients were disrespectful, they reversed their decision. The question is whether that reversal is justified. The author's anger at being guilt-tripped might be valid, but once the money was given, retracting it might not be appropriate, regardless of the recipient's behavior.\n\nAnother angle is that the teenagers might not have been genuine UNICEF representatives. UNICEF typically doesn't solicit donations in such a manner during Halloween, so the author might have been dealing with a scam or a fake charity. If that's the case, the author's actions might be more understandable. However, the story doesn't confirm whether the teenagers were legitimate or not. The author just assumes they were UNICEF, which could be a mistake.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author acted on impulse and took back the donation after giving it. Even if they felt pressured initially, the act of retracting a donation after it's been given is generally not advisable. So the author might be in the wrong because they didn't handle the situation with more composure. However, if the teenagers were indeed using fake UNICEF credentials, that could change things. But since the story doesn't clarify that, it's safer to assume they were legitimate. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
