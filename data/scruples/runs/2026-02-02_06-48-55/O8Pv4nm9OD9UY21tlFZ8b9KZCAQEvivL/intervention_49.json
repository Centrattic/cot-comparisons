My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The situation is that the author gave $1 to UNICEF trick-or-treaters but then took it back when the teenagers were sarcastic and made a joke about feeding a village.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was at home giving out candy, which they do every year. The trick-or-treaters were older, which might have been unexpected. They asked for donations for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping language. The author felt pressured and gave a dollar, but when the teens mocked the donation, the author snatched it back and slammed the door. Now they're wondering if they were wrong.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The teenagers were acting in a sarcastic and mocking manner, which made the author feel trapped. 2) The author took back the donation after the teens' behavior. 3) The author later feels conflicted but is unsure if they were in the wrong. \n\nI should consider the ethics here. Donations are usually voluntary, and the author gave initially but felt the situation was being manipulated with guilt-tripping. The sarcastic remarks might have crossed a line, making the author feel disrespected. Taking back the donation in that moment could be a reaction to being disrespected, not necessarily an act of dishonesty.\n\nHowever, some might argue that once a donation is given, even if under pressure, it's better to let it go to avoid further conflict. The author's reaction could be seen as impulsive, but the context of feeling manipulated is important. The author wasn't trying to deceive; they were reacting to perceived manipulation and disrespect.\n\nOn the other hand, the teenagers might have been doing their job, even if their delivery was poor. However, the author's right to their own feelings and reactions is valid. They can choose to support causes they believe in and reject others, especially if they feel pressured. The author's response was direct but not necessarily malicious.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's actions, while abrupt, might not be in the wrong because they were responding to perceived exploitation. The key is that the author wasn't malicious but felt disrespected. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
