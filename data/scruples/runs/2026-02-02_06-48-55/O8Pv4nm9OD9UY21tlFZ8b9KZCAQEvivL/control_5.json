My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author was handing out Halloween candy while their family was trick-or-treating. Then some teenagers come up asking for UNICEF donations, saying they're for poor kids in other countries. The author gives them a dollar but then takes it back after the teens act sarcastic about it, calls them out for guilt-tripping, and slams the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a situation where they felt pressured to donate. The UNICEF trick-or-treaters are probably doing a school project or something where they collect donations. The author felt uncomfortable and thought they were being manipulated. They gave a dollar initially but then took it back when the teens made a sarcastic comment. \n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the actions they took. The author might have felt that the teens were taking advantage of the situation, using guilt to get money. However, taking back the donation after giving it could be seen as impolite or dishonest. On the other hand, the author might have felt misled or that the request was insincere. \n\nAnother angle is that the teens' sarcastic remarks might have crossed a line, making the author react strongly. The author's response was to snatch the money back and yell at them. This reaction is aggressive, but maybe justified if the teens were being inconsiderate. \n\nBut ethically, if someone donates money, can they take it back? Once given, even if it's in a moment of pressure, the donation is usually considered irrevocable unless there's fraud. However, the author might argue that the donation was coerced. But the teens might have just been being kids, even if their tone was sarcastic. \n\nThe author's justification is that third-world kids don't celebrate Halloween, so the request is hypocritical. But that doesn't necessarily make the request invalid; maybe the UNICEF project is about raising awareness. \n\nSo the question is whether the author's actions were in the wrong. If the donation was given and then taken back, that could be seen as unethical. But if the author felt tricked or the teens were acting inappropriately, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author had the right to retract the donation. If the donation was given freely, then taking it back is wrong. If the donation was made under duress or the request was deceptive, maybe it's understandable. The author's reaction might be harsh, but the initial donation was voluntary. So maybe the author is in the wrong for taking it back. But the sarcastic comment from the teens might have been a factor. \n\nAlternatively, the author might have overreacted, but the act of taking back the donation is what's in question. In most cases, once a donation is given, it can't be taken back. So even if the author felt pressured, the action of retracting the donation might be wrong. Unless there was some form of fraud, which isn't clear here. \n\nSo the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because once the donation is made, retracting it is not appropriate, even if they felt pressured. The author could have chosen not to donate in the first place but took it back after giving, which is unethical."
