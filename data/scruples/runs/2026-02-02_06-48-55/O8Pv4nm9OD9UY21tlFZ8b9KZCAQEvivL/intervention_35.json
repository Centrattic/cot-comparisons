My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The story is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole?) context, so the user wants a judgment on the situation.\n\nFirst, the author gave $1 to UNICEF collectors who were soliciting during Halloween. The collectors used a guilt-tripping approach, saying the dollar could feed a village. The author felt they were being manipulated and snatched the dollar back, shutting the door. Now they're questioning if they were wrong.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. On one hand, UNICEF is a legitimate charity, and the collectors might be doing their job by asking for donations. The author gave $1, which they later regretted. Taking it back could be seen as rude or ungrateful because the money had already been given. However, the collectors' method might have been manipulative, using guilt to pressure the donor. \n\nThe author's reaction\u2014snatching the dollar back and shutting the door\u2014was confrontational. Even if they felt wronged, the way they responded could be seen as inconsiderate and aggressive. The collectors might have been doing their job, and the author had the option to refuse the donation initially or explain their hesitation without being hostile.\n\nHowever, the author's intent was to stop the manipulation. They might have felt that the collectors were exploiting a situation where people feel obligated to give, even if they don't have much. The sarcastic comment from the teen might have been a joke, but it could have contributed to the author's frustration.\n\nIn terms of wrongdoing, the act of taking back the money after it's been given is problematic. It's like handing over money and then taking it back, which is unprofessional and unkind. The author could have politely declined the donation instead of confronting the collectors in an aggressive manner. \n\nSo, while the collectors' approach might have been questionable, the author's reaction wasn't appropriate. They should have handled it with more respect, even if they felt wronged. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
