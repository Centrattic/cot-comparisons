My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took back their UNICEF donation was in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person offered to stay home and hand out Halloween candy. When two teenagers showed up asking for donations for UNICEF, they gave their last dollar but were mocked by the teens. In response, the person took back the dollar, told the teens off, and shut the door. They feel guilty afterward but think UNICEF was using guilt to get donations.\n\nSo, the main points here. The person was in a position where they were alone, maybe felt pressured (the teens used guilt-tripping). The teens' behavior was condescending\u2014mocking the donation and making a sarcastic comment. The person's reaction was to snatch the dollar back and tell them off. \n\nNow, the question is whether they were in the wrong. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if someone is pressured into a donation and then feels manipulated, they might have the right to retract their donation. The teens' approach was inappropriate\u2014using guilt and sarcasm. The person was within their rights to take back the money, especially since it was a small amount and they felt coerced. \n\nAlso, the person could argue that the teens were misrepresenting UNICEF's cause by using Halloween, which isn't celebrated in many third-world countries. That might add to the justification. \n\nHowever, some might say that once you give money, you can't take it back. But in this case, the act of giving was done under duress and manipulation. The person didn't have the right mindset when donating, so retracting it isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B\u2014Not in the wrong. They had a valid reason to feel manipulated, and the teens acted unethically. The person's reaction, while perhaps abrupt, was a response to being pressured.\n"
