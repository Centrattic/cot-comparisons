My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person stayed home to hand out Halloween candy while their family went trick-or-treating. They usually have a bowl of candy for kids. Then, a group of teenagers showed up asking for donations for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping tactics. The author felt trapped, gave them a dollar, but then the teens mocked the donation by saying a dollar could feed a village in a sarcastic way. The author snatched the dollar back, made a sarcastic comment about the actual cost of their candy, and slammed the door.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's initial intent was to donate, but the teens' behavior made them feel manipulated. The author then took back the donation. The question is whether this action was wrong.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Donations are voluntary. If someone feels pressured or tricked into giving, they have the right to retract their donation. The UNICEF collectors used guilt-tripping, which is manipulative. The author's reaction was defensive, maybe even a bit aggressive, but they were responding to what they perceived as manipulation. \n\nHowever, physically snatching the dollar back might be seen as rude or confrontational. But given the context, the author might have felt justified. The main issue is whether the author had the right to take back the donation after giving it. Since donations are typically considered final once given, but in this case, the donation was made under duress, there's an argument that the author was right to take it back. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it more calmly, like asking for the money back politely instead of snatching it. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the method. So, if the donation was given under false pretenses or manipulation, the author isn't in the wrong for retracting it. \n\nAlso, the teens' behavior was inappropriate. They used sarcasm and exaggerated claims to guilt-trip. The author was within their rights to stand up for themselves. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
