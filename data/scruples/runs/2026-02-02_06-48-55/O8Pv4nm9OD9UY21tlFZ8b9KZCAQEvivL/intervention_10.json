My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nSo, the author stayed home to hand out Halloween candy while their family went trick-or-treating. When some teenagers showed up, they asked for a donation for UNICEF, using the line about poor kids not being able to trick-or-treat. The author gave a dollar but felt pressured, then took back the money because of the sarcastic comment from the teens. Now, they're wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author gave money initially, which was a donation. The teens might have used a guilt-tripping tactic, which the author found off-putting. The key points here are the intent behind the donation and the subsequent actions.\n\nWhen someone donates money, especially in a situation like this, it's usually a voluntary act. If the author felt coerced or used guilt to donate, that could affect the validity of the donation. In some cases, if a donation is given under duress, the donor might have the right to reclaim it. However, this is more about legal implications, but maybe the user is thinking about social ethics here.\n\nThe author took back the money, which was already given. The teens took it, waved it sarcastically, which might have been a provocation. The author then snatched it back. Legally, once a donation is given, it's usually a completed transaction. But ethically, if the donation was given under false pretenses or manipulation, the donor might feel justified in retracting it. However, the author's response was abrupt and confrontational, which could be seen as rude or inconsiderate.\n\nAnother angle is the UNICEF aspect. UNICEF is a reputable organization, but the teens might not have been official representatives. The author could have felt that the teens were misrepresenting UNICEF's mission or using it for their own gain. However, if the teens were legitimate, then the author's reaction might be seen as undermining the cause.\n\nAlso, the author's reaction\u2014being confrontational and shutting the door\u2014could be seen as disproportionate. While the initial donation might have been given under pressure, taking it back in such a harsh manner could be rude. The author might have felt justified, but others might argue that it's better to address the issue calmly rather than confrontationally.\n\nIn terms of social norms, the situation is tricky. The author might have felt disrespected by the teens' sarcasm, leading to an emotional reaction. But the act of taking back the money publicly could be seen as embarrassing or confrontational.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions might not be the wrong thing to do in terms of reclaiming a donation given under questionable circumstances, but the manner in which they did it\u2014snatching the money and yelling\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if the donation was given under pressure, the author might not be in the wrong for retracting it. It's a bit of a grey area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the initial donation might have been coerced, even if the method of retraction was harsh.\n"
