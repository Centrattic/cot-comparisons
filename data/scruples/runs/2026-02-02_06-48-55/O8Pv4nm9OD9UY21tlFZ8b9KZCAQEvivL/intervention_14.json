My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The scenario involves the author giving out Halloween candy while their family was out. They were approached by teenagers collecting for UNICEF, who used a guilt-tripping tactic. The author gave a dollar but then took it back because they felt manipulated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a public setting during a time when people are expected to donate for charity. The teenagers might have been doing their job, but their approach was sarcastic and possibly manipulative. The author felt pressured and then reacted strongly by taking back the money. \n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. Was the author justified in feeling pressured? The teenagers' sarcastic remarks could be seen as insincere, which might have triggered the author's reaction. However, the author physically took the money back, which could be seen as aggressive or disrespectful, even if they felt wronged. \n\nOn one hand, the author might not be in the wrong because they were reacting to what they perceived as manipulation. On the other hand, taking back the donation after it was given, especially in a public and charitable context, could be seen as inappropriate. The author's actions might have been a knee-jerk reaction, but they should have tried to de-escalate the situation instead of confronting the teenagers directly. \n\nAlso, UNICEF is a legitimate charity, so even if the collectors' methods were off-putting, the author's response could be seen as dismissive of the cause. However, the use of guilt-tripping by the teens isn't the charity's fault, but it's possible the teens were just playing a game or being disrespectful. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone donates money, even if given under pressure, retracting it after the fact isn't common. The author might have a point in feeling they were manipulated, but their method of response could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their actions were probably not the best way to handle the situation. The question is whether their reaction was justified. If the answer is about whether they are in the wrong for taking back the donation, the answer hinges on whether their actions were a reasonable response to perceived manipulation. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they acted in a moment of frustration to what they saw as being pressured. However, there's a nuance here. The key is that the author felt they were being guilt-tripped and took back the donation, which might be seen as a valid reaction if they genuinely felt it was a manipulation tactic. The sarcastic comments from the teens likely made the situation worse, so the author's reaction, while aggressive, might be understandable. Therefore, the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but I should check if there's a societal expectation against taking back donations once given. \n\nIn many cases, once a donation is given, it's considered a gift, but if it was given under duress or false pretenses, the donor might have the right to retract. However, the author's method of retraction\u2014snatching the money and shutting the door\u2014could be seen as rude. But if the donation wasn't given with genuine intent, maybe it's acceptable. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the author is not in the wrong because they acted on their feelings of being manipulated. The answer is B.\n"
