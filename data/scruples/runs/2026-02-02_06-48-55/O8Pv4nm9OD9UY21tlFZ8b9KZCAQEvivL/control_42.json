My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation involves Halloween trick-or-treating where the author gave out candy while their family was away. Then, some teenagers came asking for donations for UNICEF, which the author initially gave a dollar to, but then took it back after finding their comments sarcastic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a situation where they felt pressured into donating. The teens used guilt-tripping by mentioning poor kids in other countries. The author felt trapped and gave a dollar, which was the only money they had. Then, when the teens were being sarcastic, the author took the money back and shut the door. \n\nNow, the key points here: Did the author have the right to take back the donation? Once a donation is given, it's generally considered a completed transaction unless there's some agreement to the contrary. However, the author might have felt that the donation was made under duress or misinformation. The teens misrepresented the value of the dollar, saying it could feed a village, which is clearly an exaggeration. That could be seen as misleading, which might affect the validity of the donation.\n\nAlso, the author's reaction was strong\u2014snatching the money and being confrontational. While the sarcasm from the teens was inappropriate, the author's response was to take back the dollar. Legally, once donated, the money is the recipient's. However, if there was no agreement, the author can't reclaim it. But morally, if the donation was given under false pretenses, maybe the author is justified. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If we go strictly by the act of taking back a donation, it's against the usual understanding. However, the context of being pressured and misled complicates things. The author might not be in the wrong because the donation wasn't made in good faith. But others might argue that the author should have just kept the money instead of snatching it back. \n\nAnother angle: The author gave a dollar but then took it back. The value of the dollar in terms of UNICEF's needs is probably minimal. The author's anger at the teens' approach might be valid, but the method of taking back the money could be seen as confrontational. However, since the donation was given under what the author believed to be manipulative tactics, retracting it might be justified. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the teens used inappropriate tactics. The author's actions were a reaction to that. So, the author's wrongdoing is questionable. The answer might hinge on whether the donation was voluntary. Since the author felt trapped and the teens used misleading info, the author isn't in the wrong for retracting the donation. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
