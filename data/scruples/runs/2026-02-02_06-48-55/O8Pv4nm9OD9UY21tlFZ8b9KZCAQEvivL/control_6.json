My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: The person stayed home to hand out Halloween candy. When some older trick-or-treaters came asking for donations for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping tactics, the person gave a dollar but then took it back because they felt manipulated. Now they're wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the act of taking back the donation. The person didn't like the aggressive guilt-tripping approach of the UNICEF representatives. They felt trapped and then decided to snatch the dollar back, shut the door, and express their frustration. \n\nNow, to assess whether they're in the wrong. Legally, once a donation is given, it's a completed transaction. Taking it back might not be legally permissible unless there was some fraud or misrepresentation. However, morally, it's different. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the person might argue that they were pressured into giving, so taking it back was reclaiming their agency. On the other hand, UNICEF's representatives were doing their job to collect donations, possibly using a common tactic (giving a small amount and the collector makes a big show of it to pressure others into giving more). \n\nThe writer's reaction was emotional\u2014felt trapped, sarcastic comment from the collector, leading to a heated response. The key here is intent. The writer didn't plan to take back the dollar; they acted on impulse. But the question is whether that action makes them in the wrong. \n\nOthers might say that once a donation is given, retracting it is dishonorable, especially if the collector was just doing their job, albeit perhaps in a pushy way. Alternatively, the writer might have the right to feel disrespected and reclaim their money if they felt pressured.\n\nAlso, the fact that the writer felt guilty afterward suggests internal conflict. The question is about right and wrong, not just legality. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people often use guilt to collect donations, but if someone feels manipulated, they might act out. However, snatching the money and shutting the door is confrontational. Perhaps a better approach would have been to refuse the donation initially or explain their discomfort without confrontation. \n\nBut the writer's action was a direct response to perceived manipulation. The line between standing up for oneself and being inconsiderate is thin here. The answer might hinge on whether the UNICEF representatives overstepped, which isn't clear. If their approach was unprofessional, the writer might not be in the wrong. But if the UNICEF volunteers were just doing a typical, albeit pushy, routine, the writer's reaction might be seen as aggressive.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often considers intent and proportionality. The writer acted on feeling manipulated, which is understandable. However, taking back the money after giving it might be seen as a breach of trust or generosity. \n\nBut if the donation was given under duress, then retracting it could be justified. However, the initial act of giving might have been voluntary, even if influenced by pressure. So, the writer's subsequent action might be seen as inconsiderate because the recipient (UNICEF) might not have any control over how the donation is used. \n\nAlternatively, the writer had the right to rescind the donation if they felt it was given under false pretenses. However, the scenario doesn't indicate that the UNICEF representatives lied; they just used a common tactic. \n\nSo, in conclusion, the answer might be B (the writer is not in the wrong) because they felt pressured and had the right to retract their donation upon realizing the method they were using. However, the confrontational manner might be seen as rude, but not necessarily \"wrong\" in a moral sense. The key is that the writer acted in self-defense against perceived manipulation.\n"
