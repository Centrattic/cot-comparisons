My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author left home during Halloween to give out candy. When they returned, they encountered teenagers asking for a UNICEF donation, implying that their donation could help poor kids in other countries. The author felt pressured, gave a dollar, then took it back when the teens mocked the amount. They shut the door and later felt conflicted.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The key points are: the author's intent to donate initially, the pressure applied by the teens, the sarcastic response from the teens, and the author's subsequent action of taking back the money.\n\nOn one hand, the author did give the dollar first. However, the context is that the teens used guilt-tripping tactics, which might have made the donation feel coerced. The author then felt the donation was being misrepresented (since the teens were in a position to trick or treat, unlike the children in poorer countries). The author's reaction was immediate and emotional, which could be seen as a justified response to perceived manipulation.\n\nBut legally and socially, once the money is given, can it be taken back? If the author gave it under duress or a misunderstanding, then perhaps there's a case. However, in most cases, a donation is a voluntary act, and taking it back isn't typical. The author's action might be seen as rude, even if they felt wronged.\n\nHowever, the UNICEF collectors might not have been official. It's possible the teens were just collecting on their own, which adds another layer. The author's frustration might be valid if the cause wasn't legitimate or if the approach was exploitative.\n\nSo, the dilemma is whether the author was justified in reclaiming the money due to the manipulative tactics or if their action was disrespectful regardless. The author's own admission that they felt like an asshole afterward suggests some self-awareness of potential wrongdoing.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they felt pressured and the situation involved manipulation. However, the act of taking back the money and shutting the door could be seen as inappropriate. It's a bit of a gray area. If the answer is A (author is in the wrong), it's because they shouldn't take back a donation once given, even if they felt pressured. If B (not in the wrong), it's because the donation was under false pretenses and the author corrected a mistake.\n\nBut I need to decide between A and B. Given that the author gave the money first and then took it back, which could be seen as a breach of trust or poor conduct, but their reasoning might be understandable. However, the act itself is generally frowned upon. So I'm leaning towards A, but it's close.\n"
