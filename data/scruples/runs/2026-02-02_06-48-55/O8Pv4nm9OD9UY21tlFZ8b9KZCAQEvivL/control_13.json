My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about them taking back a UNICEF donation they gave to some teenagers during Halloween. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the person was staying home to hand out candy on Halloween. Their parents are in an upper-middle-class neighborhood, which attracts trick-or-treaters from other areas. They usually have a bowl of candy for kids to grab. Then, some teenagers came asking for donations for UNICEF, claiming it's for poor kids in other countries. The person felt pressured, gave a dollar, but then took it back because the teens were being sarcastic. They shut the door, feeling guilty afterward but still think UNICEF was using guilt-tripping.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to take back the donation. Let me think about the ethics here. When you give money, can you take it back if you change your mind? Also, did the teens have a right to be there, and was the author's reaction justified?\n\nOn one hand, the author felt pressured into giving. If someone is coerced or tricked into a donation, they might have the right to retract it. The teens' sarcastic comment about feeding a village with a dollar was probably mocking, which could be seen as manipulative. The author might have realized they were being guilt-tripped and decided to stand up for themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, if the teens were legitimate UNICEF representatives, maybe the author should have handled it differently. But the story mentions they were teenagers, not adults, which might imply they're part of a school program. Even so, if they were acting inappropriately, the author's frustration is understandable. Also, taking back the money after giving it might not be wrong if they felt deceived. However, snatching it back and shutting the door could be seen as rude, but the emotional context of feeling trapped matters.\n\nAnother angle: the author's right to change their donation. Charitable donations can be revoked if given under duress. The author didn't have to give in the first place, but once given, can they take it back? Legally, maybe not, but ethically, if the donation was made under false pretenses or pressure, it's debatable. The author might feel they were misled by the teens' sarcastic remarks, which could invalidate the initial intent of the donation.\n\nAlso, the author points out that third-world kids don't celebrate Halloween, which the teens were exploiting. That could be seen as using a cultural event to guilt-trip people. The author's reaction, while harsh, might be a response to that exploitation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong because they felt pressured, realized the donation wasn't being used as intended, and had the right to retract it. The key factors are the pressure, the sarcastic manipulation, and the ethical use of the donation. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
