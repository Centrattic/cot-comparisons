My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who took back their UNICEF donation is in the wrong. The situation involves Halloween trick-or-treating where the person was collecting candy for trick-or-treaters. When some teenagers showed up asking for donations for UNICEF, the person gave a dollar but was sarcastically dismissed by the teens. In response, the person snatched back the dollar and shut the door.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The person initially donated out of a sense of guilt-tripping by the teens. The key here is the context of the situation. The person was in the middle of a Halloween event, expecting to give out candy. The UNICEF collectors might have been using the occasion to solicit donations, possibly in a way that felt intrusive or manipulative. The sarcastic comment from the teens probably made the person feel disrespected, leading them to retract the donation.\n\nNow, is it wrong to take back a donation? Generally, once a donation is given, the donor loses the right to it. However, if the donation is given under false pretenses or if the recipient is abusive, the donor might have a case. Here, the person felt trapped and the collectors were being sarcastic. The situation might be a case of the collectors misrepresenting the donation's impact or using manipulative tactics.\n\nThe person did give the dollar, then took it back. The issue is that they couldn't reclaim it once donated. However, the context of the interaction\u2014feeling coerced and the mocking response\u2014could be seen as justifying the action. The person's intent was to stop the perceived exploitation.\n\nUNICEF's usual practices are for real causes, but the way the collectors behaved in this instance was inappropriate. The person's reaction, while harsh, might be a response to feeling targeted. It's a gray area, but the person might not be in the wrong because the collectors acted in a way that undermined the donation's integrity. The author is not wrong because they were reacting to a situation where they felt manipulated, even if the method of retraction was abrupt.\n"
