My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation after a negative experience with some teen trick-or-treaters.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user gave out candy on Halloween while their family was out. Some older kids came, asked for a donation for UNICEF, and the user gave a dollar. The teens responded sarcastically, which annoyed the user. They took back the dollar, shut the door, and now feel bad about it. The question is whether the user was wrong in doing that.\n\nSo, the main points here. The user gave the dollar initially, then took it back. The key factors are the context of the donation and the behavior of both parties. \n\nFrom the user's perspective, they felt trapped into giving money under pressure (guilt-tripping) and were upset by the sarcastic response. They argue that the teens misrepresented the situation, saying that third-world kids can't celebrate Halloween. The user also mentions that the teens took advantage of the situation. \n\nFrom the other side, the teens were likely collecting for a charitable cause, UNICEF. Even if the user didn't believe in the method or the cause, taking back the donation could be seen as disrespectful. However, the user might have felt that the approach was manipulative.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Donations are voluntary. Once given, the recipient owns the money. Taking it back might be seen as a breach of trust or a lack of respect for the charity. However, if the user felt pressured or lied to, there's an argument for their frustration. \n\nThe user's actions could be seen as impulsive, reacting to the sarcasm and perceived manipulation. But the fact that they gave the dollar first and then took it back might imply that the donation wasn't made with genuine intent in the first place, especially if they were pressured. \n\nAlso, the user's reasoning about the cost of candy vs. the donation is a point. They might be suggesting that the teens were exploiting Halloween to get more money than the average candy cost. However, the teens were representing a charity, which might have different goals.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The user's reaction might be justified if they felt tricked, but taking back the donation after it was given could be seen as wrong because the money was already given. However, the context of feeling manipulated complicates things. \n\nThe main question is whether the user was in the wrong. Since they gave the money first, then took it back, and the situation involved some level of pressure and sarcasm, it's a gray area. But charities like UNICEF can't be expected to control how their volunteers interact. If the user felt pressured, maybe they shouldn't have given in the first place. But once given, taking it back might be inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the user isn't in the wrong) because they felt manipulated and had a right to be upset. However, some might argue that taking back the donation after it was given is wrong. But given the circumstances, B seems more appropriate.\n"
