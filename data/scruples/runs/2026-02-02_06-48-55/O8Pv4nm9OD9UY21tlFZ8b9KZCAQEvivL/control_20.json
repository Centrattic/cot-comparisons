My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking back a UNICEF donation they gave during Halloween. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author stayed home to hand out candy while their family went trick-or-treating. They encountered some teenage trick-or-treaters who asked for a donation for UNICEF. The author gave a dollar but felt pressured and then snatched it back, criticizing the UNICEF collection as guilt-tripping. Now they're wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the context of the donation, the interaction with the teenagers, and the author's actions. Let's consider the ethical aspects. \n\nDonations are typically voluntary. If someone donates, they can't take it back once it's given, right? But here, the author gave the dollar, then took it back. That's a bit unusual. But why did they do it? The teenagers used a sarcastic tone and exaggerated the impact of a dollar, which made the author feel trapped. The author felt that the UNICEF collectors were exploiting the situation with guilt-tripping. \n\nNow, is the author wrong for taking back their donation? Well, once a donation is made, the donor can't usually reclaim it. But this wasn't a straightforward donation. The author was pressured in the moment. The teenagers might have been using manipulative tactics, which the author found offensive. The author's reaction was to take back the dollar because they felt misled about the urgency and the context of the donation. \n\nBut legally, once the dollar is given, it belongs to the recipient. However, the ethical issue is whether the author had the right to retract their donation. The author might argue that the donation was coerced through guilt-tripping, but that's a gray area. On the other hand, the author did give the money initially, so taking it back might be seen as dishonest, as it's not something you can typically do once the transaction is complete. \n\nAlso, UNICEF itself isn't the one using guilt-tripping; the students were probably using their own methods. So maybe the author is right to feel that the collection was done inappropriately. However, taking back the money could be seen as a breach of trust in the donation process. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions were impulsive and based on their immediate emotional reaction. But the act of retracting a donation isn't standard. However, the situation was unique, with the students using a manipulative tone. The author might not be in the wrong because they felt pressured, but technically, taking back the donation isn't acceptable. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might depend on whether the pressure was legitimate and if the author had the right to retract. The author's justification is that they were guilt-tripped, but once the donation is made, even if under pressure, they can't take it back. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for taking back the money. However, if the donation was given under false pretenses (like the exaggerated impact of a dollar), then it's a different scenario. But since it's a student collecting for UNICEF, the exaggeration might be on the students, not the organization. \n\nIn the end, the author is in the wrong because they gave the donation and then took it back, which isn't standard practice. Even if they felt pressured, retracting the donation isn't acceptable. The right to take back a donation isn't something you can do after the fact. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
