My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in the story donated a dollar to UNICEF through trick-or-treaters, but then took it back when they felt the kids were being sarcastic. The main question is whether taking back the donation was wrong.\n\nFirst, the author gave the dollar initially. Then, the teens responded with a sarcastic comment about feeding a village. The author felt trapped and then decided to snatch the money back, saying they'd give less for local candy. So, the action here is taking back a donation after the fact. \n\nNow, in terms of morality, when you give money, even if it's in a situation you feel pressured, the donation is yours to make. But once given, taking it back might be an issue. However, the author might have felt deceived or manipulated by the teens' sarcasm. But the teens were acting on behalf of UNICEF, or at least representing them. \n\nBut wait, UNICEF itself doesn't use trick-or-treaters in that way. The story mentions that the teens were part of a UNICEF fundraiser, which is common in schools. So the author's anger might be misplaced. The teens were probably following a script to collect donations. The author's reaction was to take back the dollar, which was a donation made in a moment of perceived pressure. \n\nLegally, once a donation is given, it's a completed transaction. But morally, taking it back might be seen as breaking a promise or being rude. However, the author felt that the donation was coerced, especially with the sarcastic comment. The author might have a valid point about being guilt-tripped, but the act of taking back the money after giving it could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had the right to refuse the donation in the first place. But since they gave it, even if reluctantly, retracting it might not be the best approach. The author could have refused to donate in the first place without taking back the money after. \n\nSo, the key points are: Did the author have the right to take back the donation? If the donation was given under pressure, maybe they can retract it. But in reality, once given, it's up to the donor whether they want to take it back. However, taking it back might be considered inconsiderate, but the author's anger is understandable given the situation. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the donation was coerced. If the teens were using manipulative tactics, the donation might not have been entirely voluntary. So the author's reaction could be justified. However, the act of snatching the money back might still be seen as rude, regardless. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the donation was given under false pretenses (e.g., the teens being sarcastic), then the author might not be in the wrong. But if the author is taking back a donation after giving it, maybe they should have just refused to donate in the first place. \n\nIn the end, the author might be in the wrong because once a donation is made, retracting it can be seen as ungracious, even if the initial donation was uncomfortable. However, the context of feeling manipulated complicates things. But the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they took back the donation after the fact, which could be seen as rude, even if justified. Alternatively, if the donation was given under pressure, then the author isn't in the wrong (B). \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because taking back the donation after giving it, even if they felt pressured, is not the right approach. They should have either not given or handled it differently.\n"
