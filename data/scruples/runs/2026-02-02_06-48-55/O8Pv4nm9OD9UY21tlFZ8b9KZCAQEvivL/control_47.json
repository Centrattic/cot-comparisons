My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author was trick-or-treating alone, offering candy to kids. Some teenagers showed up asking for UNICEF donations, saying they're for poor kids in other countries. The author felt trapped, gave a dollar, but then the kids sarcastically commented about feeding a village. The author snatched the dollar back, got angry, and slammed the door. Now they're wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author gave a dollar out of a sense of obligation, but then felt manipulated. The teenagers' sarcastic remarks might have escalated the situation. The author took back the money after the comment. Is that justified?\n\nOn one hand, the author initially donated, even if they felt pressured. Taking it back might be seen as rude or dishonest. But on the other hand, the teenagers' behavior was dismissive and sarcastic, which could provoke someone. The author might have felt disrespected.\n\nBut legally, once the donation is given, it's the donor's choice to take it back if they can. However, the method of taking it back was confrontational. The author snatched the dollar and yelled, which might be considered rude or aggressive. The teenagers might have a right to be upset, but the author's reaction was harsh. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about UNICEF using guilt-tripping is a personal opinion. Whether UNICEF's approach is ethical might be a separate issue. The key here is the author's actions after the donation. By taking it back, did they act in the wrong? If someone donates under pressure but then decides to retract, is that acceptable? It's a bit ambiguous. The author could have just said they changed their mind politely, but their method was confrontational. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author took back the donation in a rude manner after the teenagers' sarcastic comment, maybe they overreacted. The teenagers' behavior was inappropriate too, but the author's response might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the author felt that the donation was coerced, they might have a point in retracting it. But the way they did it might be the issue. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the donation can be retracted once given. If the author could take it back, then maybe not in the wrong. But the manner in which they did so was inappropriate. However, the main issue is the act of taking back the donation. If the author can legally take it back, then the answer might be no. But if their method was wrong, maybe yes. But the question is if the author is in the wrong for taking back the donation, not the manner. \n\nHmm. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they can retract their donation if they changed their mind. The teenagers' sarcastic comment might have influenced their decision. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue that once given, the donation is done, so taking it back is wrong. It's a bit tricky. I think it depends on the intent. If the donation was given under pressure and the author feels coerced, they have the right to take it back. So the answer would be B.\n"
