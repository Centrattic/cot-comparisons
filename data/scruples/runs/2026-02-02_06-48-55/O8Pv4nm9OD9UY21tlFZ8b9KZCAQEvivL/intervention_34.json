My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author donated a dollar to UNICEF through trick-or-treaters who were collecting for them. The donation was made in a context where the author felt pressured by the teens' sarcastic comments. After realizing this, the author took back the dollar. Now, they're questioning if that was wrong.\n\nSo, considering the facts. Legally, once a donation is made, it belongs to the recipient. But the author took it back. That's a physical act of retrieving the money after giving it. Legally, that might be an issue. But morally? The author felt manipulated and decided to reclaim the donation. \n\nThe key points here are intent and context. The author donated under what they perceived as guilt-tripping. The teens' sarcastic remarks made the author feel trapped. The author's reaction was an immediate response to that discomfort. \n\nHowever, the author did give the money initially, and then took it back. The fact that they felt like an asshole afterward shows some internal conflict. The question is whether the act of taking back the donation makes them at fault.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if someone donates under pressure, can they retract the donation? In some cases, charitable donations can be reversed if they were made under duress, but that's legally complex. Morally, it's about intent. If the donation wasn't genuine, maybe the author isn't at fault for taking it back. But if the donation was given and then retracted without the recipient's permission, that could be seen as unethical.\n\nAlso, the author's justification is that the teens were tricking people into donating. The author felt the approach was manipulative. So, the author's action was a reaction to being manipulated. But taking back the money immediately might be seen as a breach of trust or a lack of consideration for the charity's cause.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the author's initial donation was under pressure, which might not have been a genuine contribution. The retraction was a response to that pressure. However, taking back the money after giving it could still be seen as inconsiderate, especially if the teens were acting on behalf of a legitimate charity. The author might have handled it differently, like not giving in the first place or confronting the teens politely. But taking back the money after the fact could be seen as rude or unethical.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for taking back the donation, even if they felt pressured. Donations are generally considered voluntary and final once given. Retracting them could undermine trust in charitable donations. Even if the donation was made under pressure, the appropriate response might have been to refuse initially or address the manipulation without retrieving the money after the fact.\n"
