My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves Halloween trick-or-treating where the author gave out candy and had some teenagers come asking for a UNICEF donation. The author gave a dollar but then took it back after feeling tricked by the teens' sarcastic response. The author is now wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a position where they were already giving out candy for Halloween. The teenagers approached not for candy but for a donation to UNICEF. The author gave a dollar, which they later realized was less than the cost of the candy they usually give. The teens' sarcastic comment about feeding a village with a dollar probably made the author feel disrespected, leading them to take back the money.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The author made a donation, albeit a small one. Taking it back after the donation was given could be seen as rude, especially if it was done in front of the teenagers. However, the author's reaction might stem from feeling manipulated or guilt-tripped. The teenagers' sarcastic comment might have crossed a line, making the author feel disrespected, which could justify their reaction.\n\nAnother angle is the nature of donations. Donations are typically voluntary and once given, they can't be reclaimed. By taking back the money, the author is essentially revoking a donation after the fact, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the situation is unique because the teenagers weren't just asking for a donation but also mocking the amount given, which might have provoked the author's response.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about the value of the dollar versus the cost of candy is a point to consider. If they felt the donation was a better use of money than the candy, that's a personal decision. But once the money is given, taking it back could be seen as impolite, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nHowever, the teenagers' behavior was inconsiderate. They might have been testing the author's reaction or simply being sarcastic. The author's decision to confront them and take back the money might be justified if they felt they were being manipulated. But the act of taking it back in front of them could have been handled more gracefully, perhaps by not giving in the first place or by explaining their reasoning calmly.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally acceptable to not donate if you choose not to. But once you donate, retracting it is unusual. The author might be in the wrong for taking back the money, but their reaction to the teenagers' sarcasm adds context. The key here is whether the author overreacted. If the teenagers were genuinely asking for a donation without sarcasm, taking back the money would be rude. However, given the teenagers' tone, the author's reaction might be more understandable.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the author might not be in the wrong entirely. They had a valid reason to feel disrespected, but their method of handling it could have been better. The answer might lean towards \"not in the wrong\" (B) because of the teens' sarcastic behavior. However, some might argue that taking back a donation is always wrong, making the answer \"in the wrong\" (A). It's a bit of a toss-up, but considering the context of the teenagers' behavior, the author's reaction is more justified, leading to answer B.\n"
