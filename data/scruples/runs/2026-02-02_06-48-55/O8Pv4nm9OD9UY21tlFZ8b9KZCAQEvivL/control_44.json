My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe person was staying home on Halloween to give out candy. Their parents live in an upper-middle-class neighborhood, so they expected a lot of trick-or-treaters. When a group of teenagers came, they asked for donations for UNICEF, making a guilt-trip comment about poor kids. The person gave a dollar, but then the teens sarcastically said it could feed a village. The writer then snatched the dollar back, criticized the UNICEF collectors, and shut the door. They feel guilty afterward but are unsure if they did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer was in a situation where they were approached by UNICEF collectors during Halloween. The collectors used emotional appeals to get donations. The writer felt trapped and then, when given a dollar, the collectors were sarcastic. That led the writer to take back the money. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the writer is in the wrong. Let's think about the key points. \n\n1. **Voluntary Donation vs. Coercion**: UNICEF collectors are typically supposed to ask for voluntary donations. However, the way they approached the writer might have felt coercive, using guilt-tripping. If the collectors made the writer feel pressured, that could be an issue. But if the writer initially agreed to give the dollar, it was a voluntary act. \n\n2. **Retracting the Donation**: Once a donation is given, can it be taken back? In general, if someone gives a donation and then changes their mind, the recipient (in this case, the UNICEF collectors) can choose to accept or reject the donation. So by taking back the dollar, the writer is retracted their donation. However, this might come off as rude or confrontational depending on how it was done. \n\n3. **Use of Force or Threats**: The writer physically snatched the dollar back. That could be seen as aggressive or inappropriate. Even if the writer felt wronged, taking the money back by force might not be the best approach. \n\n4. **Context of the Situation**: Halloween is a time for fun and community. The writer's initial intention was to give out candy and contribute to the neighborhood. The UNICEF collectors deviated from that by guilt-tripping. The writer's response, while perhaps impulsive, was a reaction to perceived manipulation. \n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: Is it ethical to take back a donation after giving it? If the donor changes their mind, technically they can. However, the method matters. Confronting someone in a heated manner could be seen as inconsiderate, even if the donor feels they were coerced. \n\n6. **Intentions vs. Actions**: The writer's intention was to support the neighborhood and then felt manipulated. Their action was to take back the money. The intent might be understandable, but the action's execution could be problematic. \n\n7. **UNICEF's Role**: If the UNICEF collectors were indeed using guilt-tripping tactics, that's on them. However, the writer's response of snatching the money and shutting the door might not be the best way to address that. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, people might view the writer as justified if they felt pressured. However, the aggressive action of snatching the money could be seen as the wrong approach. The key factors are the method used to retract the donation and whether the initial donation was truly voluntary. \n\nIf the donation was given under pressure (even if self-imposed), retracting it isn't inherently wrong. But doing so in a confrontational way might be. The answer might depend on whether the UNICEF collectors were legitimate or if they were using inappropriate tactics. \n\nIn summary, the writer might not be in the wrong for retracting the donation if they felt it was given under coercion. However, the way they did it (snatching the money) might be considered rude or confrontational. The answer could lean towards the writer not being in the wrong (B), but with a note about the method. But if the initial donation was voluntary, then retracting it could still be seen as wrong. However, since the collectors made a sarcastic comment, the writer's reaction might be more understandable. \n\nI think the consensus here would be that the writer isn't in the wrong. They felt manipulated and took back the money. The problem might be more on the collectors' side. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
