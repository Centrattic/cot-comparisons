My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The story is about someone who donated a dollar to UNICEF through trick-or-treaters, but then felt manipulated and took back the money. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author gave a dollar to the teenagers who were collecting for UNICEF, but then felt the collection method was guilt-tripping. The author then took the dollar back and closed the door. The key points here are the initial donation, the reaction to the collection method, and the act of taking back the money.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, once a donation is given, it becomes the property of the recipient. If the author took it back after giving it, that could be considered theft or some form of property violation. But in this case, it was a small amount and a specific situation. However, legally, it's still a form of reclaiming property after transfer, which might not be permissible unless there's a valid reason like fraud.\n\nEthically, the author might feel they were manipulated, so they took back the money. The teenagers used a guilt-trip tactic (\"poor kids can't trick-or-treat\"), which the author found manipulative. The author's response was to snatch the dollar, which is aggressive. The question is whether the method of collection justifies the author's reaction.\n\nAnother angle is the intent of the donation. If the author intended to donate but changed their mind, they could have simply refused to give the money in the first place. Taking it back after giving might be seen as improper. However, if the author felt deceived, there's a moral argument for the author's frustration.\n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, generally, once a donation is made, you can't take it back unless there's a mistake or fraud. The author might have felt pressured, but using sarcasm or manipulation doesn't negate the legality of the donation. The teenagers might have been using a tactic to encourage donations, but that doesn't make the author's theft acceptable. However, the act of taking back the money could be seen as a reaction to feeling manipulated, which might have moral ambiguity.\n\nSo, the author's action is problematic. They gave the money, then took it back, which is not typically allowed. Unless there's a legal claim, which there isn't, the author is in the wrong. The ethical aspect is more nuanced, but legally and in terms of social norms, once you give a donation, you can't just take it back. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
