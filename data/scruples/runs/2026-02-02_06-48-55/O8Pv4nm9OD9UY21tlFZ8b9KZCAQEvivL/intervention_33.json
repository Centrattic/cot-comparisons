My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a Halloween candy-giving setup where the author decided to stay home and hand out candy while their family went trick-or-treating. Then some teenagers showed up asking for a UNICEF donation, using guilt-tripping tactics. The author felt pressured, gave a dollar, but then took it back because of the sarcastic comment from the teens. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is in an upper-middle-class neighborhood, which attracts trick-or-treaters from other areas. They usually have a bowl of candy for kids. When the teens came, they asked for a UNICEF donation, implying the money would help poor kids. The author felt trapped, gave a dollar, but then confronted the teens about their sarcastic remarks and took the dollar back. \n\nThe author is now wondering if they did the right thing. The question is whether they're in the wrong for taking back the donation. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have felt coerced into giving the dollar because of the guilt-trip. The teens' sarcastic comment about feeding a village could have made the author feel that their donation was being mocked or that the situation was manipulative. The author might have felt that the donation wasn't being used as advertised, especially since the teens were not actually representing UNICEF properly. Also, the author points out that third-world kids don't celebrate Halloween, which could be a reason to question the relevance of the request.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did give the dollar initially, which was a voluntary action. Taking it back after giving it might be seen as taking advantage of the situation once they got a reaction. Even if the teens were being sarcastic, the author had already made the donation. However, it's possible that the author felt deceived or manipulated into giving the dollar in the first place, especially if the teens weren't being genuine about the cause.\n\nAnother angle is the context of the request. UNICEF is a legitimate organization, but the way the teens presented the donation might have been inappropriate or misleading. If the teens were not actually affiliated with UNICEF or were misrepresenting the cause for their own purposes, then the author's reaction could be justified. The author might have felt that their donation wasn't going to the cause they intended, so taking it back was a way to prevent misuse.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about the cost of candy vs. the donation is a point. If the author gives out candy worth 30-50 cents per child, giving a dollar for a donation seems excessive, especially if the teens were using guilt to force the donation. The author could be highlighting the discrepancy between the value of the candy and the donation amount requested.\n\nBut then again, even if the author felt pressured, once they gave the dollar, taking it back might be seen as a breach of trust or an act of impatience. However, if the donation was given under false pretenses or manipulation, taking it back could be a reasonable response. The key is whether the donation was made under coercion or misrepresentation.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the author genuinely believed they were being manipulated into giving a donation that wasn't being used for the stated purpose, then taking it back could be justified. But if the author simply changed their mind after the fact without evidence of misuse, they might be in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the author's initial reaction of feeling like an asshole afterward suggests some internal conflict, which adds to the complexity. They might be struggling between feeling justified in their actions and acknowledging that taking back the donation was abrupt.\n\nIn summary, the key factors are: 1) Whether the donation was given under pressure or manipulation, 2) Whether the teens were misrepresenting the cause, 3) The appropriateness of taking back the donation after giving it. If the author felt they were misled or coerced, they might not be in the wrong. If the donation was voluntary and they just had a change of heart, they might be in the wrong. The situation seems to fall into a gray area, but considering the context of the teens' behavior and the author's reasoning, it's plausible that the author's actions could be seen as justified.\n"
