My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation involves a Halloween scenario where the author gave a dollar to UNICEF collectors but then took it back because they found the collectors' approach manipulative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a position where they were trick-or-treating alone, and unexpected teenagers came asking for donations. The collectors used guilt-tripping tactics, which the author found off-putting. The author then took back the dollar, feeling it was inappropriate to donate under such circumstances.\n\nNow, thinking about the principles involved. Donations are typically voluntary and based on personal choice. If someone feels pressured or manipulated into giving, they might reassess their donation. The author felt trapped, so taking back the money might be seen as a right of the donor. However, the method of retrieving the dollar\u2014snatching it and shutting the door\u2014could be considered rude or aggressive.\n\nOn the other hand, the collectors were representing UNICEF, which is a charitable organization. Their approach might have been unprofessional if they used sarcasm or guilt-tripping, which could reflect poorly on the organization. The author's reaction, while possibly justified in their frustration, might not be the best way to handle it. But the core issue is whether the author had the right to retract the donation.\n\nDonations are generally final once given, but if there was a sense of coercion or deception, some might argue that the donor can rescind their contribution. However, the author could have addressed the issue by reporting the collectors' behavior instead of taking the money back. That said, the situation is a bit of a gray area. The author's actions were impulsive and might not have been the most diplomatic, but their feelings of being manipulated are valid.\n\nConsidering all factors, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the donation was made under pressure. However, the method used to take back the money could be criticized. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the key point is the justification for retracting the donation. If the collectors used inappropriate tactics, the author's decision might be understandable. So the answer is likely B (No).\n"
