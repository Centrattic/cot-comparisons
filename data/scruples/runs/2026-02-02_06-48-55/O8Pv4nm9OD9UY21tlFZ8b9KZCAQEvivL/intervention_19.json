My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. \n\nFirst, the context: During Halloween, the author gave out candy while their family was out. Teenagers came trick-or-treating but instead of regular candy, they asked for a donation for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping tactics. The author felt pressured, gave a dollar, but then took it back after the teens sarcastically exaggerated the impact of the dollar. The author shut the door on them, feeling conflicted afterward.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the arguments. On one side, the author was in their home, had the right to refuse donations, and felt manipulated. The teens' sarcastic comment might have been inappropriate, and the author isn't obligated to donate. On the other hand, once the donation was given, taking it back could be seen as rude or dishonest. However, the author might have felt coerced into giving, which complicates things.\n\nLegally, once a donation is given, it's a completed transaction. Taking it back could be a breach of trust. Ethically, if someone feels pressured, they might have the right to retract the donation, but doing so publicly and rudely could be seen as inconsiderate. The key here is whether the pressure was undue. The UNICEF collectors used guilt-tripping, which the author found manipulative. The author's reaction was defensive, which might be understandable if they felt tricked into giving. But taking back the money after the fact might still be considered wrong in some contexts.\n\nSo, the balance is between the right to retract a donation when feeling coerced versus the social expectation of honoring donations once made. The author's actions were impulsive and confrontational, which could be seen as the wrong approach, even if their initial feelings were justified. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for taking back the donation but not for their initial refusal to donate. However, since the question is about taking back the donation, the answer hinges on whether retraction is acceptable. Since the author's reason was feeling manipulated, and donations are typically voluntary, the act of retraction isn't inherently wrong. So the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
