My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's family was trick-or-treating, and the author stayed home to hand out candy. When some older trick-or-treaters came asking for UNICEF donations, the author gave a dollar but then took it back because of the perceived sarcasm from the teens. The author felt manipulated and decided to give the money to local kids instead, which led to closing the door on them. Now, the author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reaction to the donation request and the subsequent retrieval of the dollar. The UNICEF representatives used a guilt-tripping approach, which the author found manipulative. The author then took the dollar back, which might be seen as impolite or aggressive. However, the author's reasoning is that the teens were taking advantage of the situation and that third-world kids don't celebrate Halloween, so the donation might not be relevant.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Was the author justified in feeling manipulated? If the UNICEF representatives were using guilt-tripping tactics, the author's reaction might be understandable. However, taking back a donation after it's been given could be seen as rude. On the other hand, the author had the right to decline the donation if they felt uncomfortable. The question is whether the author was wrong in retrieving the money after giving it.\n\nAnother angle is the purpose of the donation. If the author believed the money wasn't being used as intended, maybe the reaction was a form of protest. However, the author didn't know the actual use of the funds. The sarcastic response from the teens might have inflamed the author's emotions, leading to an impulsive action.\n\nIn terms of social norms, interrupting the donation after it's been given might be considered impolite. The author could have simply declined the donation instead of taking back the money. But the author's motivation was to redirect the money to local kids, which is a charitable intent. It's a conflict between two charitable causes.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If taking back a donated dollar is considered rude or improper, then the answer would be A. However, if the author's reaction was a justified protest against manipulative tactics, the answer would be B. The community's perspective on guilt-tripping vs. the right to change one's mind on a donation is key here. I think it's a nuanced case, but the act of retrieving the money might be seen as inconsiderate, making the author possibly at fault.\n"
