My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. \n\nFirst, the context: The author was at home giving out Halloween candy when a group of teenagers came trick-or-treating, but instead of asking for candy, they asked for a donation for UNICEF. The author gave them a dollar but then took it back because the teens were mocking the contribution, implying that the dollar could feed a village. The author shut the door, feeling conflicted later.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's actions and the reasons behind them. The question is about whether the author was wrong to take back the dollar. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, once money is given, it technically belongs to the recipient. However, the situation here is a bit different because the donation was made under what the author perceives as coercion (being guilt-tripped). The author took back the money because they felt manipulated. \n\nEthically, this is a gray area. On one hand, the author made a donation with the understanding that it was for UNICEF, but the teens might just be collecting on their behalf. The author might feel that the teens were inappropriately pressuring them with guilt. On the other hand, if the teens were genuinely collecting for UNICEF and the author later realized they didn't want to donate, taking back the money could be seen as undermining the charity's efforts.\n\nHowever, the way the teens presented the request\u2014using sarcasm and exaggeration about feeding a village\u2014might have crossed a line. The author felt trapped and then took back the money after the teens acted disrespectfully. The immediate reaction was one of frustration, which is understandable. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't inherently wrong for feeling pressured and reacting in the moment. The act of taking back the dollar might be seen as a response to the teens' manipulative tactics rather than a refusal to support UNICEF itself. However, if the teens were legitimate representatives, the author's action could be problematic. But since it was Halloween and the teens were probably just collecting for the organization, the author's response might be more about the manner in which the request was made rather than the charity itself.\n\nSo, the author's main issue was the way the donation was solicited. They felt guilt-tripped and then mocked. Taking back the money after that interaction might not be entirely their fault. The key here is the context of the situation and the appropriateness of the teens' behavior. If the teens were using manipulative or disrespectful tactics, the author's response is more about addressing that than being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
