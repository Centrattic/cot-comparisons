My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nSo, the person stayed home to hand out Halloween candy while their family went out. Then some teenage trick-or-treaters came asking for donations for UNICEF, saying they wanted to help poor kids who can't trick-or-treat because they live in poor countries. The author felt trapped, gave a dollar, but then got angry when the teens sarcastically said the dollar could feed a village. The author snatched the dollar back, insulted them, and shut the door. Now they're asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a situation where they felt pressured by the UNICEF collectors. They initially donated out of guilt, maybe, and then regretted it when they realized the collectors were being sarcastic. The key points here are: was the donation given under duress or manipulation? Did the author have the right to take it back?\n\nThe UNICEF representatives presented the donation as a way to help poor children, but the author felt tricked because the collectors used guilt-tripping tactics. However, once the donation is given, can it be taken back? That's a legal question. Generally, once you give money, it's theirs unless there's an agreement to return it. But in this case, the donation might have been based on a false premise. The collectors exaggerated the impact of a dollar, which could be considered deceptive.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, even if the donation was made under pressure or with misinformation, taking it back and being rude might not be the best approach. The author could have explained their change of heart politely. However, the initial donation wasn't voluntary; the author felt trapped. The sarcastic response from the collectors might have been the last straw, leading to an emotional reaction.\n\nAnother angle: Halloween is a time for fun, and the collectors used a moment meant for children to guilt-trip adults. The author might have felt it was inappropriate. The collectors might have been using a manipulative tactic by framing their request as helping poor kids during a kids' event, which could be seen as exploiting the situation.\n\nSo, legally, the author might not be able to take back the donation without a contract. But morally, if the collectors were deceptive, the author isn't entirely at fault. However, their reaction of snatching the money and being rude could be seen as rude and impolite, even if they felt wronged. The author's actions were reactive and maybe lacked consideration for the other person's perspective.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong for their aggressive reaction, even if the initial donation was problematic. But the collectors' approach was questionable. It's a bit of a grey area. The answer depends on whether the focus is on the collectors' tactics or the author's response.\n"
