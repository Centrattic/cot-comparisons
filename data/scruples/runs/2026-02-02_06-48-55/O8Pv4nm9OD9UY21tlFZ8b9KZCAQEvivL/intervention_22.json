My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author gave out candy on Halloween, then a group of older trick-or-treaters asked for donations for UNICEF. The author had a dollar and gave it, but then took it back when the teenagers acted sarcastically. The author shut the door on them, feeling conflicted afterward.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let's consider the perspectives. On one hand, the author felt tricked into donating and took back the money, which could be seen as a reaction to being manipulated. On the other hand, once the donation was given, taking it back might be seen as disrespectful or unethical, especially if the money was already given in good faith.\n\nThe teenagers' behavior was sarcastic, which might have made the author feel pressured. However, taking back the donation after it was given could be seen as impolite. The author might have been within their rights to refuse donating in the first place, but taking back the money after giving it could be problematic because it's not a typical transaction. Donations are usually final once given.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about UNICEF's methods being manipulative is a separate issue. While the author might have felt that the approach was guilt-tripping, the act of reclaiming the money after donation might still be considered impolite or inconsiderate, regardless of the donation method.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong for taking back the donation once it was given. However, some might argue that the context of feeling manipulated justifies the reaction. But generally, retracting a donation after it's been given isn't standard. So, leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A).\n"
