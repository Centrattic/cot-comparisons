My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Halloween trick-or-treating where the author's family usually gives out candy. The author stayed home to do that while the parents went out. Then some teenagers came asking for donations for UNICEF, saying they were collecting for poor kids in other countries. The author gave a dollar but then felt manipulated and took it back, shut the door on them. Now the question is, is the author wrong for doing that?\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's perspective: they felt tricked or guilt-trpped into donating. They gave a dollar but when the teens acted sarcastically, they took it back. The author's reasoning is that the UNICEF collectors were using a guilt trip, and they felt like they were being manipulated. Also, they mention that the teens were older, maybe high schoolers, and their sarcastic comment made the author feel like they were being taken advantage of. The author then decided to take back the dollar and shut the door.\n\nOn the other side, UNICEF is a legitimate charity. The teens were probably following a school or community program where they collect donations during Halloween for a good cause. They might have been instructed to ask for donations with a specific script, and maybe the sarcasm was their own, not part of the program. The author's action of taking back the money and slamming the door could be seen as rude and unkind, especially if the teens were genuinely collecting for a good cause. Also, the author had already given the dollar, so taking it back after the fact might be considered unethical because the donation was already given.\n\nBut then again, the author might have felt pressured in the moment. They mention feeling \"trapped\" when the teens approached. The sarcastic comment might have been a trigger for the author to realize they didn't want to donate under those circumstances. The author might have felt that the donation wasn't voluntary, so taking it back was their way of reclaiming their decision.\n\nAnother angle: the author's argument that third-world kids don't celebrate Halloween. That's a valid point. Maybe the UNICEF collectors were using a misleading approach by connecting Halloween (a Western tradition) with their cause. The author's frustration could stem from that disconnect, feeling that the cause wasn't directly related to the event they were participating in.\n\nBut is it the author's place to take back the donation? Once a donation is given, even if the person feels manipulated, is it acceptable to take it back? That's a key point. In many cases, once a donation is given, it's considered a completed transaction. However, if the donation was given under false pretenses or manipulation, maybe the donor has a right to retract it. However, in this case, the donation was small\u2014just a dollar. The author could have refused to donate in the first place instead of taking it back after the fact.\n\nAlso, slamming the door and being rude to the teens could be seen as an overreaction. Even if the author felt they were being manipulated, the way they responded might have been disrespectful. The teens were just collecting for a cause, even if the method was questionable. The author could have explained their refusal politely instead of being confrontational.\n\nBut the author did mention feeling like an asshole afterward, which shows some remorse. They might have acted on impulse in the moment. The sarcastic comment from the teens probably escalated the situation. The author's reaction was immediate and emotional, which is understandable if they felt deceived.\n\nSo weighing all this, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they gave a donation and then took it back, which can be seen as unethical. On the other hand, they felt pressured and acted on that feeling. The key factors are the manipulation aspect and the appropriateness of their response.\n\nIn terms of the UNICEF situation, it's possible that the organization uses this method of collecting during Halloween, which is a common practice. However, if the collectors were being sarcastic, that's their own behavior, not necessarily the organization's. The author's action of taking back the money might be justified if they felt the donation was not given freely. But the act of taking it back and being rude might not be the best approach.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the donation was given under duress and whether the author's response was appropriate. If the donation was not under duress, then taking it back is wrong. But if the author felt they were being manipulated, maybe they have a point. However, the response was not polite. So maybe the author is partially in the wrong for the way they reacted, but not entirely. But according to the options given (A or B), the choice is between yes or no.\n\nGiven that the author did give the dollar first, then took it back and slammed the door, the act of retracting a donation might be seen as unethical, especially if the cause is legitimate. The response was also rude. Therefore, the author is in the wrong, so the answer would be A. However, some might argue that the author had the right to retract the donation if they felt manipulated. But in general, once a donation is given, it's expected to stand. So the answer is A.\n"
