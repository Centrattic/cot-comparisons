My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they did something wrong by taking back their UNICEF donation. The situation involved a Halloween scenario where they were handing out candy. Then, some teenagers came asking for donations for UNICEF, using a guilt-trip tactic. The author felt pressured, gave a dollar, but then took it back due to the sarcastic comment and the way it was handled.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in a position where they might have felt cornered or manipulated by the teenagers. The key points here are the pressure tactics used by the teens (using the phrase \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\" and mentioning poor kids not having Halloween), the sarcastic comment about feeding a village with a dollar, and the author's reaction.\n\nDonations are voluntary, so the author had the right to contribute or not. The issue is whether the author's reaction was appropriate. The author took the dollar back, which might be seen as taking back a donation after it's been given. But the circumstances involve feeling manipulated. The teens' behavior was likely the main issue here\u2014using guilt and sarcasm to get a donation.\n\nLegally, once a donation is given, it's a completed transaction. But in this case, the author took back the money before it was handed over. The author took the dollar from the teen's hand and shut the door. So maybe the transaction wasn't complete. The author's frustration with the manipulation might justify their reaction. However, some might argue that after giving the money, taking it back could be seen as inconsiderate or disrespectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was clearly upset by the pressure and the sarcastic remark. The situation was uncomfortable, and the author's response was a reaction to that. The UNICEF aspect here is that the teens might have been using an aggressive method, which could reflect poorly on the organization. The author's decision to retract the donation was based on feeling that the organization was exploiting a situation for guilt-based donations. \n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone feels pressured and wants to retract their donation, is that acceptable? It's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions could be seen as justified given the circumstances, especially if the donation was made under duress. However, others might say that once you give a donation, even if you're upset, you should not take it back. But in this case, the author didn't let the donation go through; they stopped it mid-transaction. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were in response to feeling manipulated. The wrongness would depend on whether the author had the right to retract the donation before it was finalized. Since the author took the dollar back immediately, perhaps it's less about the donation itself and more about the method of collection by the teenagers. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling uncomfortable and retracting the donation in that moment. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
