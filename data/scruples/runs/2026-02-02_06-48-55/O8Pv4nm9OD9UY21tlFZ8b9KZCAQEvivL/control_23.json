My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're at fault for taking back their UNICEF donation. They told their parents they'd stay home and give out candy during Halloween. Their family left, and when some older trick-or-treaters came asking for UNICEF donations, they gave a dollar but felt pressured. Then the teens acted sarcastically, making comments about the dollar feeding a village, which annoyed the person. They snatched the dollar back and told the teens to leave, feeling guilty afterward.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. The situation involves a donation. Once you give money to someone, can you take it back? The teens were soliciting for UNICEF, which is a charity. The author gave a dollar initially, but when the teens acted condescending, they took it back. Legally, once the dollar is given, it's theirs. But ethically, is that wrong? \n\nThe author felt trapped and the teens used guilt-tripping. The sarcastic comment might have made the author feel they were being mocked. Taking the money back could be seen as rude, but maybe the author had a right to feel pressured. The key point is whether the donation was made under duress. If the author felt coerced, maybe they have a valid reason to take it back. However, once the donation is made, it's usually considered a charitable contribution. But since the money was given directly to the kids as a donation, perhaps the author can reclaim it if the kids were not legitimate representatives. Wait, the kids were trick-or-treating and part of the Halloween tradition, so maybe they were just participating in the event. The author might have been misled into thinking it's a legitimate UNICEF fundraiser, but in reality, UNICEF's Halloween activities are often school-based, like the \"Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF\" program. So if the teens were not part of that official program, maybe the author isn't wrong to take back the money. \n\nThe author had a right to feel uncomfortable with the pressure and the sarcastic remark. Taking back the donation, especially if the teens didn't follow proper procedures or if the author felt they were tricked, could be justified. However, if the teens were legitimate, then the author might be at fault. But the story mentions the teens are \"trapping people into feeling guilty,\" which the author found manipulative. The author's parents are in an upper-middle-class area where others come for candy, so the author might be supporting a tradition but also not want to be exploited. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, if the teens were not properly representing UNICEF or if the author felt coerced, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the donation was voluntary and the teens were legitimate, then taking it back is wrong. The author's own guilt after the fact suggests they feel conflicted. However, the teens' behavior was inappropriate, so the author had a reason to be upset. The answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the initial donation was made under pressure and the teens acted disrespectfully. So, B for No.\n"
