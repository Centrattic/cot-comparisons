My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about taking back a UNICEF donation. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: The person was left home to hand out candy on Halloween. They gave out a dollar to some teen trick-or-treaters who were collecting for UNICEF. The teens acted sarcastically, saying the dollar could feed a village. The author then took the dollar back, got angry, and slammed the door. Now they're wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they're asking for another opinion. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have felt pressured. The teens used guilt-tripping tactics, making the author feel like they had to give. The sarcastic comment about the dollar feeding a village could be seen as manipulative. The author's reaction was defensive, maybe because they felt cornered. They might not have wanted to donate in the first place but felt obligated, then snapped when it was called out.\n\nOn the other hand, once a donation is given, even if reluctantly, taking it back might be seen as inconsiderate. The UNICEF collectors were doing their job, even if the method was pushy. The author had the choice to donate or not; by taking back the money, they're being rude. Also, the teens might be just doing what they were asked, not intentionally being sarcastic. The author's outburst could be seen as overreacting.\n\nBut wait, the author mentioned feeling trapped. Maybe they were trying to stand up against manipulation. The comment about third-world kids not celebrating Halloween adds another layer\u2014maybe they felt the donation wasn't being used effectively. However, that's their opinion, and it's not the collectors' fault. \n\nThe key points are: Was the author justified in taking back the donation? Is the method of fundraising (using guilt) unethical? The author's reaction was harsh, but so was the collectors' approach. But once the dollar was given, taking it back is a problem. So maybe the author is at fault for being rude, but the collectors also weren't handling it well. \n\nHowever, the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether taking back the donation is acceptable. If someone gives money under pressure and then regrets it, can they take it back? Legally, maybe, but socially, it's rude. So the author's action is impolite, but maybe they had a reason. Still, they could have said \"no\" instead of taking the money back. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at intent and proportionality. The author's reaction was harsh, even if they felt wronged. So the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong for being rude and taking back the donation after giving it. But there's nuance. However, the standard here is usually about being the asshole, which is behavior that unreasonably hurts others. The author's actions were inappropriate, so I'd say A.\n"
