My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation. \n\nFirst, the scenario: The person stayed home to give out Halloween candy while their family went trick-or-treating. Some older kids came asking for donations for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping tactics. The person gave a dollar but then took it back because they felt manipulated.\n\nThe key points here are the context of the donation and the method used by the collectors. The writer mentions that the teens were being sarcastic and using pressure tactics. They felt trapped and later regretted giving money, especially since they realized the candy they usually give costs less than the dollar. Also, the argument that kids in poor countries don't celebrate Halloween might be a valid point about the relevance of the donation.\n\nNow, considering the ethics. The person gave the dollar under what they perceived as pressure. However, once the donation is made, can they take it back? Legally, donations are typically considered gifts and cannot be reclaimed unless there's a specific agreement. But ethically, it's more about intent and how the donation was obtained. If the collectors used manipulative tactics, the donor might feel it's their right to retract the donation. \n\nOn the other hand, the collectors might argue that they were just doing their job, and the donor had the choice to refuse. The sarcastic remark could be seen as inappropriate, but the organization itself isn't at fault for the collectors' behavior. However, the writer's reaction was to snatch the money back and shut the door, which might be seen as aggressive. \n\nSo, the question is whether the writer's actions were a justified response to the collectors' tactics. Since donations are voluntary and the person felt coerced, taking back the money could be seen as their right. However, the manner in which they took it back (snatching and yelling) might be criticized as rude. But the core issue is whether they were wrong for retracting the donation. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the collectors' approach was problematic, but the donor's reaction might be seen as impulsive. The writer might not be in the wrong for taking back the money, especially if they felt manipulated. So the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
