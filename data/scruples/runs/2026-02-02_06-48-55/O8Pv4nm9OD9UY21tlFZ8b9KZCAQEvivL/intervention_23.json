My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong when they took back their UNICEF donation. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author was giving out candy on Halloween when a group of teenagers showed up asking for donations for UNICEF. The author gave them a dollar, but then the teens responded sarcastically, leading the author to snatch the dollar back and shut the door. The author is now wondering if they were wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author might feel they were manipulated or guilt-tripped into donating. The UNICEF students might have been doing their usual collection. But the author's reaction was aggressive\u2014grabbing the money back and slamming the door. That's probably where the issue lies.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, giving money is a choice, and the author had the right to withhold it. However, taking back the donation after it was given and then being confrontational is where the problem arises. Publicly grabbing the money and shutting the door could be seen as rude or disrespectful, even if the author felt wronged. \n\nAlso, the author might have overreacted. Instead of confronting the teens that way, they could have just said no and left it at that. The sarcastic comment from the teens might have been a ploy, but responding with anger could escalate the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't obligated to donate if they don't want to. The issue is more about the method of handling the situation. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not donating, but their actions in taking back the money and being confrontational are questionable. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because of how they handled the situation, not the decision to not donate. So the answer is A.\n"
