My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about Halloween, and the author was giving out candy while their family was trick-or-treating. Then some teenagers came asking for UNICEF donations. The author gave them a dollar but then took it back because they felt manipulated by the sarcastic comment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions and intentions. The author initially donated a dollar, which was all they had. Then when the teens acted sarcastically, the author took the dollar back. The question is whether that was wrong.\n\nOne angle is that the author had the right to change their mind. If someone donates money, they can take it back before the recipient keeps it. The author might have felt pressured or tricked into giving, so retracting the donation isn't necessarily wrong. The teens' sarcastic remark could have made the author feel that the donation wasn't being used as intended, maybe even mocking the situation.\n\nBut on the flip side, if the author gave the dollar, even if they felt coerced, taking it back might be seen as rude or dishonest. The UNICEF collectors might have had a legitimate cause, and the author's reaction could be seen as dismissive of their efforts. Also, the author's language when shutting the door might be harsh, but that's their personal choice.\n\nAnother point is the context of Halloween. It's a time for fun and charity, and some people might use the occasion to collect donations. The teens might have been doing their job, even if their delivery was sarcastic. The author's reaction could be justified if they felt the approach was manipulative.\n\nHowever, the author did admit feeling like an asshole afterward, which shows they might recognize that their response was harsh. But they also justified it by pointing out the hypocrisy of using Halloween, a Western tradition, to ask for donations for kids in other countries who can't participate.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's action of repossessing the dollar crosses a line. Since the donation wasn't official yet (the teens had just received the money and were holding it up sarcastically), the author could argue they hadn't finalized the donation. So, they might not be in the wrong for taking it back. The problem might be more about the teens' approach than the author's response.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't obligated to donate, and if they feel pressured, they can withdraw their donation. The main issue is the method of collection by the teens, not the author's reaction. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
