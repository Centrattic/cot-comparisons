My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking back their UNICEF donation after a negative encounter with trick-or-treaters.\n\nSo, the situation: They stayed home to hand out candy on Halloween. Their parents' neighborhood gets visitors from other areas. They set up a bowl of candy. Then, some teenagers come up asking for donations for UNICEF, using guilt-tripping language. The person feels trapped, gives a dollar, but the teens respond sarcastically. The person then takes back the dollar, gets angry, and slams the door. They later feel bad but question if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the donation was voluntary. They gave a dollar, which was a choice. The trick-or-treaters might have been using manipulative tactics, but the person had the right to decide whether to donate. Taking back the money after giving it might be seen as rude or dishonest. However, the context is important. The teens' sarcastic response could have provoked the person. They felt they were being taken advantage of, especially since the teens were using guilt-tripping methods. Also, the person points out that third-world countries don't celebrate Halloween, so the appeal was misleading. \n\nBut legally, once money is given, it's a donation. Taking it back isn't something they can do once it's handed over. Morally, the question is whether the context justifies reclaiming the donation. The person might have felt they were coerced, but the donation was still a voluntary act. The way the teens reacted could be unprofessional or inappropriate, but the person's response was aggressive. \n\nSome might argue that the author overreacted but that they were right to question the legitimacy of the appeal. Others might think that once a donation is made, even if under duress, it's not appropriate to take it back. The key here is whether the author had the right to retract the donation after it was given. Since they did give it voluntarily, taking it back might be seen as wrong. However, the manipulation by the teens could mitigate some of the blame on the author. \n\nThe author's justification for feeling wronged is based on the idea that the donation was coerced and the context was misleading. However, the act of taking back the money might be considered inconsiderate. So the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were justified under the circumstances. If the donation was given in a pressured situation, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but they should have handled it differently. However, physically taking back the money might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nIn summary, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because the donation was given under potentially coercive tactics. But taking back the money after giving it could be seen as rude. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the context of manipulation plays a role, but there's a nuance here.\n"
