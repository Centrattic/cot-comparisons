My parents live in an upper middle class neighborhood so families from other areas go there to get better candy, which we totally welcome and support. We usually just hold up a big bowl full of candy that kids can just grab out of and let them have at it. I personally love seeing their reactions when they see full sized candy bars in the bowl.\n\nSo family left and I stayed, everything was going well then I had a couple of teenage trick or treaters show up. I open the door with the bowl of candy thinking, \"hmm these kids are a little old but whatever\". That's when they say, \"trick or treat... For UNICEF!\"\n\nThey then tell me they're looking for donations \"for poor kids who can't come trick or treat because they live in poor countries with barely anything to eat\". I don't really like the way I feel trapped at that point but alright, I pull my wallet out and see I have only one dollar in there. I give it to them, one of them grabs it, holds it up between two fingers while waving it in the air and says, \"oh wow a dollar! This could like, feed an entire village wow... So generous wow...\" in the most sarcastic tone ever.\n\nI look at this dude and literally snatched the dollar from him. I tell him, \"or I can just give you the $.30 to $.50 I'm giving kids around here since that's about how much the candy we give out costs. Third world country kids don't even celebrate Halloween but here you are trapping people into feeling guilty. Get the hell out of here\" and I shut the door in their face.\n\nI'll admit I felt like an asshole after but damn that just came out of left field. Just felt like UNICEF was taking advantage of the situation by guilt tripping people. So AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking back a dollar they gave to UNICEF during Halloween trick-or-treating. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author offered to give out candy while their family was away. Then, some teenagers showed up asking for donations for UNICEF, using the pretext of helping poor kids who can't trick-or-treat. The author gave a dollar but then the teens were sarcastic, saying that dollar could feed a village. The author took the dollar back, said they were taking advantage, and slammed the door. Now they're wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Was the donation made under duress or deception? The author felt trapped and tricked into giving the dollar. The teens used guilt-tripping tactics, which the author found manipulative. The author then took back the money, feeling it wasn't appropriate to donate in that context.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the act of giving a donation is usually voluntary. If the UNICEF representatives used pressure or false information (like implying the dollar would feed a village when that's not realistic), that could be misleading. The author might feel they were manipulated into donating, so taking it back could be seen as reclaiming an improperly obtained donation.\n\nOn the other hand, taking back the money after giving it might be considered impolite or inconsiderate, especially if the donation was for a charitable cause. The author's reaction was strong, slamming the door and confronting the teens. That could be seen as aggressive, but if the initial interaction was manipulative, the author's response is defensive.\n\nIn terms of legal or moral wrongs, if the donation was a voluntary act, retracting it might not be appropriate. However, if the donation was given under false pretenses or coercion, then it might be justified. The author's main argument is that the teens were exploiting the situation and using guilt to get money, which the author found unethical.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the donation was made voluntarily. If the UNICEF collectors used deceptive or coercive tactics, the author's retraction is understandable. But if the donation was made freely, then taking it back might be inconsiderate. However, the scenario describes the teens as being sarcastic and using exaggerated claims, which could be seen as manipulative. So the author might not be in the wrong for taking back the money, especially if they felt deceived. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
