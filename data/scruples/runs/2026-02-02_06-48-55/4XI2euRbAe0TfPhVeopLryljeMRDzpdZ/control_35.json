It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with a guy because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. They want a simple A or B answer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met someone on Tinder, they had a good time initially. When visiting his apartment, they saw a sword and immediately thought negative things like \"incel\" or something related to the \"I studied the blade\" meme. They didn't confront him immediately but later, during a drive, brought it up. The guy tried to explain it's an antique from his grandfather, but she was unresponsive. Then she broke up with him, and her friends are mixed in their opinion.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. So I need to evaluate if her reaction was justified. The key points here are her judgment based on a sword, the explanation provided by the guy, and her friends' opinions.\n\nThe sword is a real, antique one, which he inherited from his grandfather. The author's immediate association with negative stereotypes (like incel) might be premature and based on a superficial judgment. The guy's friends and her friends liked him, and the relationship was going well otherwise. The sword's presence alone doesn't necessarily indicate a red flag. Her friends think she's overreacting, which suggests that maybe the sword isn't a big issue in terms of character. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to her feelings. If she feels uncomfortable about the partner owning weapons, even if it's a family heirloom, it's her choice to end the relationship. However, the way she approached it might be seen as dismissive. She didn't give him a chance to explain in the moment and then brought it up later, leading to an awkward breakup. Her friends think she should apologize or consider a second chance, but the decision to break up is hers.\n\nIn AITA situations, the focus is on whether the action was unreasonable. While the guy's explanation is plausible, the author's reaction is based on a quick assumption without considering context. However, personal preferences in relationships are valid. The main issue is whether the sword is a legitimate concern. Since it's an antique and not a functional weapon used for harm, her reason might be a red herring. But the breakup was her choice, and if she's not comfortable, she isn't in the wrong for that. However, the judgment without fully considering the explanation could be seen as being too hasty. The guy's side is that he tried to explain, and she didn't accept it. Her friends are split, but two think she's an asshole. \n\nSo the answer might be A (she's in the wrong) because her reaction was based on a stereotype and she didn't engage properly with his explanation. Or B (she's not in the wrong) because it's her right to end the relationship based on her comfort.\n"
