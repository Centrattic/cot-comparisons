It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author did the right thing by breaking up with the guy over the ninja sword. Let's start by going through the story again to make sure I understand the key points.\n\nThe author met someone on Tinder, had a good time, and things seemed to be going well. They went to his apartment and saw a sword, which made her think of the \"incel\" stereotype and the \"I studied the blade\" meme. She didn't say anything at first, but during the drive to a party, she brought it up. The guy tried to explain it's an antique from his grandfather, but she was still uncomfortable. After the party, she broke up with him, and now her friends are split\u2014two think she's an asshole, others think she's right.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the sword issue. The guy said it's an antique, from his grandfather's time in Japan after the war. The author's main issue is that it's a weapon, and she doesn't want to be with someone who has weapons. But is that a valid reason? Well, weapons in a home can be a red flag for some people, especially if there's a history of violence or if the person is into something that might be associated with extremism. However, the guy's explanation is that it's an antique. If it's a real historical artifact, maybe it's not a weapon he uses. But the author's reaction was immediate, thinking along the lines of the \"incel\" meme. That might indicate a bias or a judgment based on stereotypes.\n\nThe author didn't give him a chance to explain more, or maybe even verify if the sword was indeed an antique. She reacted emotionally, which is understandable, but breaking up immediately might be hasty. The guy's friends seemed okay, and he hadn't asked for sex yet, which the author appreciated. So maybe the sword was a sudden deal-breaker without considering context.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone has a weapon in their home, and you feel uncomfortable around weapons, that's a valid personal feeling. The author might have a right to her feelings. However, breaking up based on a single item without a deeper conversation might be jumping to conclusions. Also, the guy didn't seem to have a violent background\u2014his friends were nice, and he was a Navy pilot. Maybe the sword was just a harmless collectible. The author's friends said she's making a mountain out of a molehill, which is a common criticism here. The guy's reaction to her breakup was dismissive, which might have added to her frustration.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's judgment based on a stereotype, not giving the guy a chance to fully explain, and acting on an immediate emotional reaction. Her friends' mixed reactions show that opinions vary. Legally, owning a sword isn't illegal in many places unless it's for criminal purposes. Culturally, there's a stigma around certain items, but that's subjective.\n\nIn terms of relationships, if someone has a red flag that you can't overcome, it's okay to walk away. But if the red flag is based on a misunderstanding or a stereotype, that's different. Here, the author didn't seem to consider the explanation and jumped to conclusions. So maybe she's being judgmental. However, her feelings are valid. The question is whether her reaction was justified. Since the guy didn't have a violent history and the sword is an antique, maybe she overreacted. But her discomfort is real, and relationships are about mutual comfort. However, breaking up over that without trying to discuss it further is a problem. \n\nThe guy might have been defensive and didn't handle the situation well, but that's part of communication. If she had asked more questions or given him time to explain, maybe they could have resolved it. Since she broke up immediately, maybe she's the asshole because she didn't give him a fair chance. Alternatively, if the sword made her uncomfortable, she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her feelings. \n\nBut in terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the community often looks at intent and whether the action was reasonable. If her reaction was based on a stereotype and not a real threat, then she's the asshole. If she's just being honest about her feelings and the guy's inability to address her concerns, then he might be at fault. The guy's dismissive response at the end probably didn't help, but the initial breakup decision is hers. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong) because she made a snap judgment based on stereotypes without fully considering the explanation. However, if the sword was a genuine concern for safety, then she's not. But since the sword is an antique and not a weapon he's using, it's more about her perception. So leaning towards A.\n"
