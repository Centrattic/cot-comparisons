It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original story is in the wrong for breaking up with the guy because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met a guy on Tinder, they had a good time, but when she went to his apartment, she found a sword. She felt uncomfortable, associated it with something negative like \"incel\" or the meme about studying the blade. She didn't say anything at first but later told him she couldn't date someone with weapons. He tried to explain it's an antique from his grandpa, but she wasn't convinced. They went to a party, it was awkward, and she ended things. Her friends are split, two telling her she's being an asshole. She's confused because she thought he was nice otherwise.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let me break down the key points. \n\nHer reasoning for breaking up was the sword. She found it unsettling and associated it with negative connotations. However, the guy explained it's an antique from his family, not a weapon he uses. She dismissed his explanation, focusing on the sword as a weapon. \n\nFrom her perspective, maybe she felt it was a red flag. If someone has a weapon, even if it's an antique, it might raise concerns about their intentions or mental state. But she didn't give his explanation enough weight. However, the guy might argue that the sword is a family heirloom and has no malicious intent, so her reaction was unfair. \n\nHer friends think she's overreacting. They point out that the sword is an antique, which he inherited, and that she's being judgmental. If that's the case, maybe she didn't consider his side enough. But she also has the right to set boundaries in a relationship. If having weapons is a dealbreaker for her, even if it's an antique, she's not in the wrong for ending things because of her personal comfort.\n\nBut the question is about whether she's the asshole. Breaking up over something like this could be seen as being overly judgmental if there's no real threat. However, if she feels it's a dealbreaker, maybe it's not her fault. The guy might have a valid reason, but she's allowed to prioritize her own comfort. \n\nOn the other hand, if the sword wasn't a functional weapon and just a decorative antique, her reaction might be seen as unnecessary. She didn't ask to see it or check if it was dangerous. She assumed the worst based on a stereotype. That could make her the asshole for not giving him the benefit of the doubt. \n\nBut again, relationships are about personal boundaries. If she can't get past the presence of a weapon, regardless of its history, it's her choice. The guy might not have considered how someone would perceive a sword in his apartment. Maybe he should have explained it earlier or not displayed it prominently. \n\nSo, it's a bit of a toss-up. The answer might hinge on whether the sword was a legitimate concern. Since it's an antique and not for use, her reaction is based on her own biases. The guy might not be a threat, so her overreaction could make her the asshole. But if her intuition was that something was off, and she felt uncomfortable, she's not entirely wrong to end it. \n\nIn some cases, people have legitimate fears about weapons, even if they're antiques. However, the way she dismissed his explanation without considering it might be where she went wrong. She could have asked more questions instead of immediately seeing a red flag. \n\nConsidering all that, maybe the answer is A (she's in the wrong) because she didn't give his explanation enough consideration and acted on her assumptions. However, if the sword's presence genuinely made her uncomfortable and she set boundaries, it's not entirely her fault. The line is thin here. \n\nAlternatively, if the sword was a family heirloom and he's a Navy pilot with a background that might explain having such an item, her reaction could be seen as unwarranted. But if she's not comfortable with potential weapons in a partner's home, that's her right. So maybe not in the wrong. \n\nHmm. I think the key is whether the sword posed a real risk. Since it's an antique and not a functional weapon, her reaction is more about personal discomfort than actual danger. Her friends think she's overreacting, which suggests she might be. So the answer could be A. But if personal boundaries are respected, then B. \n\nI'm leaning towards A because she didn't engage with his explanation and made a judgment based on stereotypes. She could have asked more before deciding. So the answer is A.\n"
