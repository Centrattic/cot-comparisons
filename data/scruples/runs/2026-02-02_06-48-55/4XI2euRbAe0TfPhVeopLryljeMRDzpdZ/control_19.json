It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up because the guy had a ninja sword in his apartment. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author met the guy on Tinder, they seemed to get along well, but the sword was a dealbreaker. The guy explained it was an antique from his grandfather, but she still felt uncomfortable. Her friends are telling her she's being an asshole, but she's unsure.\n\nSo, the key points are: She broke up over the sword, he had a legitimate explanation, but she didn't buy it because of her personal discomfort. Now, is she wrong for that?\n\nWell, in relationships, people have different dealbreakers. If something makes you uncomfortable, it's your right to address it. But the sword in this case is an antique, not a modern weapon. She might be overreacting because of stereotypes (like the \"incel\" stereotype), but her safety is a legitimate concern. However, she didn't confront him about the sword directly or ask for more information before deciding. She made a judgment based on her initial reaction without considering his explanation enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's friends thought it was cool. She didn't give him a chance to fully explain, maybe due to her own biases. Also, she didn't communicate her concerns properly. She broke up over something that might not be a real threat but a perception issue. \n\nBut her safety is important. If she felt uneasy about him having a weapon, especially if she's not in a position to trust her gut, then her decision makes sense. However, the way she handled it\u2014breaking up without a real discussion\u2014could be seen as abrupt. \n\nHer friends said to apologize and give him a second chance, but maybe she's justified in her feelings. The problem is whether the sword was a legitimate reason. If he's a Navy pilot and not a threat, maybe she's overreacting. But if she's not comfortable, it's her choice. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong: If she's making a judgment based on stereotypes and not the man's character, then yes, she's in the wrong. But if her discomfort is genuine and she's prioritizing her safety, maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. The key is that she didn't explore his explanation thoroughly enough. She assumed the worst without checking facts. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes), she's in the wrong because she made a judgment based on a stereotype and didn't give him a chance to properly address her concerns. However, there's a valid perspective that she's in the right if she's uncomfortable. The subreddit might lean towards her being in the wrong because she broke up over something that seems trivial when there's no evidence of danger. So, the answer is A.\n"
