It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with someone because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. The author met the guy on Tinder, they had a good time, but when visiting his place, the author saw the sword and immediately thought of negative stereotypes, leading to the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy is a Navy pilot, which might mean he's been stationed overseas, and the sword is an antique from his grandfather who was in the Navy post-WWII. The guy explained the sword's history as an antique, but the author was unimpressed and focused on the weapon aspect. The friends thought the sword was cool or overreacted to the situation. \n\nThe author's main issue is that they don't want to date someone with weapons. However, the sword is a historical item, not a functional weapon. The author's reaction seems based on a stereotype (like the \"incel\" reference) rather than any actual threat. The guy didn't use the sword, just displayed it. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. Breaking up over a non-functional antique sword without any evidence of danger could be seen as judgmental. The guy tried to explain, but the author dismissed it. The friends think the author overreacted. However, the author's comfort and safety are valid. If someone has a weapon in their home, even if it's an antique, it's understandable to feel uneasy. But the key is whether there was an actual threat. Since there wasn't, maybe the author was too quick to judge based on stereotypes. \n\nOn the other hand, people have different thresholds for what they're comfortable with in a partner. The author might not be in the wrong for choosing not to proceed if they feel the presence of a weapon is a deal-breaker. The problem is the assumption that the sword is a weapon, not an antique. The guy might have reasonably displayed it as part of his heritage. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the sword was a real weapon, maybe not. But as an antique, the author's reaction could be seen as unfounded. The guy didn't hide it, but the author made a judgment without further investigation. The friends' reactions also suggest the author overreacted. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they broke up based on a stereotype without considering the context.\n"
