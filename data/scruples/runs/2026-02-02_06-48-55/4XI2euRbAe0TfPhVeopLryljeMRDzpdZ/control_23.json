It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they broke up with a guy because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. The guy is in the Navy, which might be relevant. The sword is an antique from his grandpa, part of a family heirloom or something. The author is uncomfortable because they associate swords with violence or maybe something like incel culture, and they just don't want to date someone with weapons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that they're not comfortable with their partner having a weapon. They didn't mention any actual threat or danger, just their own discomfort. On the other hand, the guy had a legitimate reason for owning the sword\u2014it's an antique, part of his family's history, not for use as a weapon. He tried to explain it, but the author didn't seem to accept the explanation and ended things over it.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal boundaries and judgment. The author's friends are telling them they're being unreasonable, which might suggest that the sword itself isn't a valid reason to break up. But the author felt strongly enough about their own comfort and safety that they made the choice to end the relationship. \n\nIs it the author's fault for having those feelings? Well, people have different triggers and boundaries. If the sword made them uncomfortable, maybe they're justified in that. But if the sword is a family heirloom and not a weapon used for violence, then maybe the author is overreacting. Also, the guy didn't have a criminal history or a violent past; the sword was just an object. \n\nHowever, in relationships, it's important for both people to respect each other's boundaries. If the author felt that having a weapon in the house was a deal-breaker for them, even without any evidence of danger, they have the right to walk away. But some might argue that the sword isn't a weapon in the traditional sense and that the author is making a mountain out of a molehill. \n\nThe guy's reaction is also a point to consider. He was upset and gave a last shot comment, which might indicate he felt disrespected. But the author's main issue was the sword, and they communicated that. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the sword is a legitimate concern. Since there's no indication of actual danger, and the sword is an antique, maybe the author is overstepping by using it as a reason to break up. However, if the author's comfort is a valid personal boundary, then they aren't in the wrong. \n\nBut the friends are saying the author acted like an asshole. The author didn't give the guy a chance to explain properly and dismissed his explanation. The guy explained it was an antique, but the author kept focusing on the sword being a weapon. That might suggest the author was being judgmental without considering the context. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not being open-minded. \n\nAlternatively, if the author's personal boundaries are such that they can't be around weapons regardless of context, then they have the right to make that choice. But since the sword is not a modern weapon and is part of his family's history, it's a bit of a red herring. So perhaps the author is being too judgmental and the friends are right to say they acted like an asshole. \n\nHmm, I think the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong. They based the breakup on a misunderstanding and didn't consider the context. But others might say B, that they're not wrong for having that boundary. It's a bit of a toss-up. But given that there's no actual danger and the sword is a family heirloom, the author's reaction seems overblown. So A makes sense.\n"
