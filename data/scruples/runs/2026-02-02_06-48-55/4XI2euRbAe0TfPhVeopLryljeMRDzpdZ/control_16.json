It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole for breaking up with someone because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. The situation is about a relationship that seemed to be going well until the sword was discovered.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author met the guy on Tinder, they had a good time, but when she visited his apartment and saw the sword, she became uncomfortable. She thought of incel stereotypes and the \"I studied the blade\" meme, which is a reference to the \"incel\" (involuntary celibate) community sometimes associated with violent tendencies. The guy tried to explain it as an antique from his grandfather, but she couldn't get past the idea of a weapon in his home. She broke up with him because she didn't want to be with someone who owns weapons, and now her friends are telling her she's acting like an asshole.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, the sword was an antique and a family heirloom, not something he likely used for anything dangerous. The guy's friends mentioned he's a Navy pilot, so maybe the sword has historical significance. The author's reaction seems based on fear or prejudice against weapons, which could be a valid personal decision. However, judging someone based on a stereotype (incel) without knowing their actual intentions might be unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy did own a weapon, even if it's not for personal use. The author's discomfort is real, and she's within her rights to feel unsafe and end the relationship. But her friends argue that she's overreacting. The key here is whether her judgment was based on legitimate safety concerns or unfounded stereotypes. If the sword is just a family heirloom and not a weapon he uses, her reaction might be seen as irrational. However, if she felt unsafe, even if the weapon is not functional, it's her prerogative to end the relationship.\n\nThe guy's response was to not take her concerns seriously, which could be his fault. But the author's decision to break up because of a weapon might be seen as her being in the right if she felt unsafe. However, if the weapon was not a real threat, she could be overreacting. It's a bit of a gray area. The community's opinion here might depend on whether the sword was a legitimate weapon or just an antique. Since the guy said it's 300 years old and part of his family's history, it's likely not a functional weapon. So the author might be in the wrong for judging him without considering the context. But if she genuinely felt unsafe, she's not wrong to act on her feelings. The answer hinges on whether her reaction was based on real danger or prejudice.\n"
