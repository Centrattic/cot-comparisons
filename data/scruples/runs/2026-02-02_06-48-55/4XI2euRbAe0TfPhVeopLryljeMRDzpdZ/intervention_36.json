It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with a guy because he had a ninja sword in his apartment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met someone on Tinder, they had a good time, and things were going well. When the author visited the guy's apartment, they saw a sword and immediately associated it with negative stereotypes like \"incel\" or the \"I studied the blade\" meme. The guy tried to explain it's an antique from his grandfather, but the author was uncomfortable with the weapon aspect. They ended up breaking up, and some friends think the author is being too harsh, while others support them. The author is unsure if their reaction was justified.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's judgment based on a stereotype, the guy's explanation about the sword's history, and the author's personal boundaries regarding weapons. \n\nThe author's main issue is that they can't get past the sword being a weapon, even though the guy explained it's an antique with no practical use. The author's friends are split, with some saying the author is overreacting. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up because of this.\n\nI need to consider if the author is being unreasonable. The sword is an antique, not something he bought for personal use. The author's reaction seems to be based on a stereotype rather than the actual item's purpose. However, personal boundaries are valid. If someone has a deal-breaker about weapons, even if it's based on a stereotype, they have the right to end the relationship if they can't overcome that discomfort.\n\nBut is it wrong to base a breakup on a stereotype? The author didn't check the facts or consider the explanation given. The guy tried to explain, but the author dismissed it. That could be seen as judgmental. However, it's also okay to have personal limits, even if others don't understand them. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy might not have properly addressed the author's concerns. If the sword was a significant part of his family's history and he felt it was important, maybe he should have explained it more clearly. But the author's immediate reaction was to think the worst without considering the context.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action was based on valid reasons and if the person acted in bad faith. Here, the author acted based on a stereotype and didn't engage deeply with the guy's explanation. That could make them seem judgmental. However, the decision to end a relationship is personal, and if the author genuinely felt uncomfortable, it's their choice. But the way they reacted\u2014without fully considering the explanation\u2014might be seen as hasty or closed-minded.\n\nSo, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because they made a snap judgment based on a stereotype and didn't give the guy a chance to fully explain, leading to a breakup that might have been avoidable with more discussion. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) could be argued if personal boundaries are respected regardless of the reason. But since the reason is based on a stereotype, maybe A is more accurate.\n"
