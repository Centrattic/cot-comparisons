It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original story is in the wrong for breaking up with the guy because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met someone on Tinder, they seemed to get along well, but when the guy showed his sword, she got uncomfortable and broke up with him. Her friends are saying she's acting like an asshole, but she's seeking opinions here.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about judgment and assumptions. The author immediately thought of the \"incel\" stereotype and the meme about studying the blade. She didn't confront him directly, didn't ask for more context, and made a snap judgment. The guy tried to explain it's an antique from his grandfather, but she dismissed his explanation. She also mentioned she doesn't want to be with someone who owns weapons, which seems like an overreaction. \n\nOn the other hand, having a weapon in the apartment could be a concern for some people, but the sword in question is an antique, not a modern weapon. The author didn't give the guy a chance to explain properly and decided to end the relationship over this. Her friends think she's overreacting. \n\nBut then again, if she's uncomfortable with weapons, maybe it's a valid reason for her. However, the way she handled it\u2014without discussing it calmly first and breaking up immediately\u2014might be the issue. She didn't give him a chance to address her concerns. Also, her reaction seemed more based on stereotypes rather than actual evidence of danger.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, the question is about whether she acted inappropriately. She made an assumption without understanding the context. While it's her right to not be with someone who has weapons, her approach might be seen as dismissive and not giving him a fair chance. Her friends think she's being an asshole because she didn't consider the explanation and reacted judgmentally. \n\nAlternatively, if her personal boundaries are such that she can't be around weapons, then her decision isn't wrong. But the way she handled it\u2014breaking up without discussion\u2014could be problematic. The answer might depend on whether the sword was genuinely a legitimate concern for her. Since it's an antique and not for practical use, maybe her reaction is unreasonable. \n\nI think the community would likely side with her friends in this case, suggesting she's the asshole because she made a snap judgment based on stereotypes and didn't engage in a proper conversation. So the answer is A, yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
