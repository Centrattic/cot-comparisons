It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for breaking up with the guy because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. I need to figure out if the author made a mistake here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The guy had a sword, which the author found concerning. The sword was an antique from his grandfather, but the author was focused on it being a weapon. The author mentioned not wanting to date someone with weapons. The guy tried to explain it's an antique, but the author didn't seem to buy it. The breakup happened after the date.\n\nNow, the key points: Is it reasonable for the author to break up over a sword? Well, the sword was there for a reason\u2014family heirloom. Unless there's a safety issue, maybe the author overreacted. But people do have different deal-breakers. The guy didn't use the sword for harm, so maybe the author's reaction was based on personal discomfort rather than a real threat. The friends think she's overreacting, but she might have valid reasons for her discomfort around weapons.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy was trying to explain the sword's history, and she didn't seem to listen. That could suggest she was dismissive. But it's also about personal boundaries. If she's uncomfortable, maybe breaking up wasn't wrong. However, maybe she could have discussed it more instead of ending things immediately. The guy's comment about her reaction not impressing him might indicate he felt disrespected. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It depends on whether her reaction was justified. Without more info about the guy's intentions with the sword, it's hard to say. But since he didn't threaten her or use it, her decision might be based on a misunderstanding. Her friends think she's wrong, but she might have had reasons. The sword could symbolize something else to her, like instability or potential danger. However, if there's no evidence of danger, maybe she's being too judgmental. \n\nOverall, the answer might be A (she's in the wrong) because she broke up without fully considering the explanation, but some might say B (she's not in the wrong) because personal comfort is valid. The community might lean towards A, considering the sword isn't a red flag on its own, so her reaction could be seen as overreacting. Thus, the answer is A.\n"
