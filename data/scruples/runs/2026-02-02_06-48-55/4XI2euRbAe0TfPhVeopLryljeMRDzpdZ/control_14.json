It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation (AITA) is in the wrong. The scenario is that she broke up with a guy because he had a ninja sword in his apartment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy had a sword, which she found concerning. He explained it was an antique from his grandpa, but she still felt uncomfortable. She didn't want to date someone with weapons, and he felt her reaction was unimpressed. Her friends are divided, two saying she's being an asshole, others not. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about personal boundaries and reasonable reactions. She didn't feel comfortable with him having a weapon, even if it's an antique. But does that make her the asshole? Well, people have different comfort levels. If someone has a red flag that makes them uncomfortable, it's their right to walk away. The guy's sword, even if valuable, could be seen as a weapon, and her reaction is based on her own feelings of safety and judgment. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe some would argue that she didn't give him a chance to explain properly or that she was being too quick to judge. However, she did mention that he tried to explain it's an antique but she still wasn't swayed. Her friends might see it as overreacting, but others might support her decision. \n\nThe guy's reaction was to get a last shot in, which could indicate he wasn't entirely in the right either. She's standing by her decision because of her personal boundaries. In relationships, it's important both parties feel comfortable. If she's not comfortable with the presence of a weapon, even if it's not being used for harm, it's her right to prioritize her feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong. But I should check if there's any other angle. Did she have prior issues with him? No, the problem was the sword. Was there any other context? She didn't mention other red flags. So her breaking up based on her discomfort with the sword is a personal choice, and while others might see it as overreacting, it's her right to make that decision.\n"
