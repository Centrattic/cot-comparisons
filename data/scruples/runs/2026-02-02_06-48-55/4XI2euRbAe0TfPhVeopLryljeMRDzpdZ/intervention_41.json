It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up because their partner had a ninja sword in their apartment is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both perspectives. The author met someone on Tinder, they had a good time, and things seemed to be going well. Then, during a visit to his apartment, they found a sword and immediately thought negative things about the person's intentions. The guy tried to explain it's an antique, but the author was still uncomfortable and ended the relationship. \n\nNow, the key points here are about judgment and assumptions. The author felt that having a sword meant the guy was into violent or inappropriate things (like the \"incel\" stereotype). But the guy actually explained it's an antique from his grandfather. The author's reaction seems based on their own fears or biases without considering the explanation. \n\nBut wait, is having a sword inherently problematic? The author is uncomfortable because it's a weapon. However, the guy is in the Navy, which might be a legitimate reason for having such an item, maybe for collection or historical reasons. The author's judgment might be unfounded. Yet, it's also about personal comfort. If someone feels unsafe around weapons, even if the item is harmless, they have the right to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy might feel his explanation was valid, but the author dismissed it. However, the author's reaction was based on their own perception, which might not be fair. But the author isn't necessarily wrong to have those feelings. Maybe the issue is about communication\u2014should the author have given more consideration before breaking up?\n\nThe friends' reactions are mixed. Some think the author is overreacting, others support them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship over this. The answer hinges on whether the author's judgment is reasonable. If there's no evidence the sword was a threat, maybe the author is overstepping. But if the author felt unsafe, maybe they aren't wrong to end things. \n\nHowever, the author didn't give the guy a chance to explain further or verify the story. They made an assumption based on a stereotype. That could be seen as the author's fault. On the other hand, it's their right to feel uncomfortable with weapons in a partner's home. \n\nSo, the answer is a bit nuanced. But the question is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the sword is an antique and not a threat, then the author's reaction might be based on unfounded fears. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for making a hasty judgment without proper investigation. Alternatively, if they have a legitimate fear of weapons, they might not be. \n\nBut the narrative suggests that the author's friends are divided, and the author's own reasoning is that they don't want to date someone with weapons. The guy's explanation was dismissed as ridiculous. So maybe the author is overreacting and making an assumption. Hence, A (author is in the wrong) might be the answer. But I'm not 100% sure. Maybe the answer is B, as personal feelings about safety can be valid even if the item isn't dangerous. \n\nHmm. The line between reasonable discomfort and irrational judgment is blurry here. The author's main issue is the presence of a weapon, regardless of its actual purpose. If that's the case, then maybe they are in the wrong for letting a stereotype (incel, etc.) influence their judgment without evidence. So the answer could be A.\n"
