It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about breaking up with someone because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. Hmm. The author met this guy on Tinder, they had a good time, but when the guy showed the sword, the author had a negative reaction. The guy tried to explain it's an antique from his grandfather, but the author still felt uncomfortable and decided to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's reaction is justified. The sword is a weapon, but it's also an antique. The guy is in the Navy, but being a pilot, maybe he's not in a combat role. The author's friends think she's overreacting. The key here is whether the sword's presence is a legitimate concern. If it's an antique and not being used as a weapon, maybe it's just a collector's item. But the author's main issue is the association with weapons, possibly thinking about violence or incel stereotypes. \n\nHowever, the author mentions that the guy didn't ask for sex, which she appreciated. So her judgment isn't entirely based on him being a bad person but more on the sword. The problem is that the sword might not be a real threat. The guy explained it's a family heirloom, which the author dismissed. If she's against weapons in general, maybe that's her personal choice, but breaking up over it without considering his explanation could be harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, if someone has a weapon in their home, even if it's an antique, it might make the author uncomfortable. She has the right to her feelings. But does that justify breaking up? The guy said her reaction didn't impress him, which upset her. Maybe she should have discussed it more before the breakup. \n\nThe friends think she's overreacting. If they found the sword cool, maybe the author is being too judgmental. The guy might not have intended to have a weapon for violent purposes. So, the author's decision is based on her feelings, but the way she handled it, not discussing it more and just breaking up, might be seen as abrupt. \n\nBut the question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's honest about her feelings, then it's not entirely her fault. However, dismissing his explanation and the sword's history could show a lack of understanding. The answer might depend on whether the sword was a legitimate red flag. If there's no evidence of him being violent, then she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her comfort. But if she's making a mountain out of a molehill, then maybe she is. \n\nIn the end, since the sword is an antique and not a threat, her reaction might be seen as over the top. So the answer could be A (author is in the wrong). But if personal comfort is valid, then B. Hmm, the friends think she's being an asshole, but two people might not be the best judges. I think the key is that the sword isn't a real danger, so her reaction is based on stereotypes. Therefore, she's in the wrong.\n"
