It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she broke up with a guy because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. She met him on Tinder, they had a good time, but when she saw the sword, she felt uncomfortable and decided to end things. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that she doesn't want to be with someone who owns weapons. She associated the sword with negative stereotypes, like the \"incel\" meme and the idea of someone being violent. She didn't confront him immediately, waited until after the party, and then broke up with him. Her friends are split, with two telling her she's being an asshole.\n\nOn the other side, the guy had an antique sword that was a family heirloom, part of his grandfather's history. He tried to explain its significance, but she wasn't receptive. He didn't own any other weapons, and the sword was a collector's item. He felt disrespected by her reaction, especially after he tried to explain its history.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal boundaries and communication. She has a right to feel uncomfortable, but maybe she could have handled it better. Breaking up over something that's not directly harmful might be seen as overreacting. However, her safety and comfort are important. If she genuinely felt unsafe or associated the sword with violence, that's her personal boundary, even if others don't understand it.\n\nThe guy might have a point in feeling hurt because he was trying to explain the context. But she also has the right to her own feelings. The question is whether her reaction was reasonable. If she doesn't want to be with someone who has weapons, even if they're not harmful, that's her choice. But maybe she should have considered his explanation more before ending things.\n\nHer friends think she's overreacting, but others might agree with her. It's a cultural or personal issue. Some might say she's being judgmental without understanding, while others support her right to set boundaries. \n\nIn the end, whether she's in the wrong depends on whether her reaction was justified. Since she has the right to her own comfort and safety, even if others don't see the issue, her decision might be valid. The guy might have to accept that people have different standards. So, the answer is probably B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
