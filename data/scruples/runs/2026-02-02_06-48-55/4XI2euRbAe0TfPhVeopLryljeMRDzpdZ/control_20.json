It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for breaking up with someone because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author met a guy on Tinder, they had a good time, and things were going well. When visiting his apartment, they noticed a sword, which made the author uncomfortable. The guy explained it's an antique family heirloom from his grandfather. The author felt it was a red flag, possibly indicating something negative (like the incel stereotype), and decided to break up because they don't want to date someone with weapons. The guy was hurt by the breakup, and the author's friends are divided, with two saying the author is acting like an asshole.\n\nNow, considering the context: the author's main issue is the presence of a weapon, which they associate with violence or certain negative stereotypes. However, the guy provided an explanation that the sword is an antique and not a functional weapon. The author, however, doesn't seem to accept that explanation and focuses on the sword's potential for harm. \n\nIs the author justified in their reaction? Well, the author has the right to set boundaries in a relationship. If they feel uncomfortable with someone owning a weapon, even if it's an antique, that's a personal choice. However, the key here is whether the sword itself is a legitimate concern. Antiques, especially swords, are often collectibles and not meant for actual use. The author's reaction seems based on a stereotype rather than the actual functionality or intent behind the sword. \n\nThe guy tried to explain the history and value of the sword, but the author dismissed it, thinking he was making excuses. This could be seen as the author not giving him the benefit of the doubt or misjudging his intentions. However, the author is not wrong in prioritizing their own comfort and safety. If they associate swords with violence or have personal reasons to avoid weapons, that's their prerogative. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's friends suggest that the reaction is overblown. They might argue that the sword isn't a real threat and that the author is being judgmental without sufficient reason. The guy's friends also liked him, so maybe the author is misreading the situation. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is based on their own feelings and experiences. If they're uncomfortable with weapons in a partner's home, that's a valid personal boundary. The question is whether that's a reasonable boundary. Some might argue that an antique sword isn't a weapon in the same way as a gun, for example, and thus the author's reaction is irrational. Others might say that if the author is uncomfortable, it's reasonable to end the relationship.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on whether the author's reaction is justified. Since the sword is an antique and not a functional weapon, the author's fear might be unfounded. However, the author has the right to their own feelings and boundaries. The main issue is that the author made a judgment based on a stereotype rather than the actual facts provided by the guy. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, if the decision to break up was based on a stereotype and not on the actual danger or misuse of the weapon, then the author might be in the wrong for being judgmental. But if the author's discomfort is genuine and they feel it affects their ability to be in a relationship, then it's their choice. The problem is that the author didn't seem to fully consider the explanation given, which could indicate that they acted on a stereotype. \n\nSo, weighing all factors, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they made a judgment based on a stereotype without properly evaluating the explanation given. Alternatively, if respecting personal boundaries is the priority, then B (not in the wrong). But given that the sword is an antique and not a weapon in the traditional sense, and the author's reaction seems to stem from a stereotype rather than a legitimate safety concern, the answer could lean towards A.\n"
