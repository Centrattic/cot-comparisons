It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with a guy because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and the guy were on a date, and when she visited his apartment, she saw a sword. She immediately thought negative things like \"incel\" and the meme about studying blades. She didn't say anything at first but later brought it up, and the guy explained it's an antique from his grandfather. She still felt uncomfortable about him having a weapon and decided to break up. Her friends think she's being too harsh.\n\nNow, I need to assess if she was wrong. She's not in a relationship yet, just dating. She had her reasons based on her personal discomfort with weapons. The guy's explanation didn't change her mind because she's against dating someone with weapons. She broke up because she felt it was a dealbreaker. \n\nHer friends say she's being an asshole, but she might be acting on her own boundaries. It's important to consider that relationships require mutual comfort. If she's not comfortable with weapons, it's valid for her to step back. However, maybe she didn't give the guy's explanation enough weight. The sword is an antique, not something he's using for self-defense or aggression. \n\nIs it wrong to have a sword? Not necessarily. Many people have weapons for various reasons, like historical interest. But she's not wrong in her feelings. She's allowed to set boundaries. The guy might feel disrespected if she didn't consider his side more, but she also has a right to her feelings. \n\nThe key here is whether she overreacted. If the sword was a legitimate safety concern, that's one thing, but she's more concerned about the idea of him having weapons. It's a personal choice. Since she's not in the relationship yet, she's within her rights to end things based on her comfort. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's respecting her own boundaries, even if others think she's making a mountain out of a molehill. It's her prerogative to decide what she's comfortable with in a partner.\n"
