It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with someone over a ninja sword they own.\n\nFirst, the author met a guy on Tinder, had a good time, and things seemed to be going well. Then, during a visit to his apartment, she noticed a sword. This made her think of negative stereotypes like \"incel\" or the \"I studied the blade\" meme. She didn't confront him immediately but became quiet. When asked, she expressed her discomfort, and he tried to explain it's an antique. She still felt uncomfortable about him owning a weapon and ended the relationship. Her friends are divided, with some saying she's overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's reaction to the sword, the context of the relationship, and the reasons for the breakup. \n\nI need to determine if her decision was unreasonable. The sword is a real weapon, but it's an antique and not something he uses. Her main issue is not with the sword's historical value but the fact that he owns a weapon. She didn't ask him to get rid of it but ended the relationship because of it. \n\nSome might argue that her reaction is based on unfounded stereotypes. She didn't give him a chance to explain properly but made a snap judgment. Others might say she's within her rights to end the relationship if she feels uncomfortable with weapons, especially in the current climate where weapon ownership can be sensitive. \n\nHer friends told her she's acting like an asshole, but she doesn't think so. The question is whether her actions were justified. If someone has a legitimate reason to feel unsafe or uncomfortable, they might have a right to end the relationship. However, if the sword isn't a threat and she's judging him without considering his explanation, that could be seen as her being in the wrong. \n\nThe sword's presence alone isn't inherently a red flag unless there's a history of violence or instability. The guy tried to explain its significance, but she dismissed it. Her reaction might stem from personal biases or stereotypes, which isn't fair to him. \n\nIn conclusion, her decision to break up based solely on the sword without further investigation or understanding could make her the asshole. She didn't address the issue constructively, leading to a hasty decision.\n"
