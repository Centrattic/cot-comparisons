It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with someone because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. The answer needs to be either A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met someone on Tinder, they hit it off, and things were going well. Then, during a visit to his apartment, he had a ninja sword. The author was concerned, thinking about the \"incel\" stereotype and the \"I studied the blade\" meme. She didn't like that he owned a weapon and decided to break up with him. Her friends are divided, with two saying she's an asshole for it. She's now seeking the subreddit's opinion.\n\nThe key points here are: the presence of a sword, her reaction based on that, and her friends' conflicting opinions. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's wrong. Breaking up with someone can be a valid choice depending on the reason. The sword itself is an antique, according to him, and he's a Navy pilot. So, maybe he has a legitimate reason for owning it, like it's a family heirloom or for display. However, the author's main issue is that he has a weapon. But is a ninja sword a weapon in the sense that she's thinking of? It's an antique, possibly for historical or decorative purposes. But she's not in the military, maybe she's associating it with violence or something else.\n\nHer friends think she's overreacting. They say others might find it cool. But she's not comfortable. Should she be forced to overlook something that makes her uncomfortable? Or is her reaction too hasty? \n\nLegally, owning a ninja sword (katana) in the US is legal unless prohibited by local laws. Since he's in the Navy, maybe he's in an area where it's allowed. So there's no legal issue. The problem is more about her personal boundaries. \n\nIf someone has a legitimate reason for owning the sword, and the author is breaking up solely because of that, maybe she's being judgmental. But if the sword makes her uncomfortable and she doesn't want to be in a relationship with someone who owns weapons, then her choice is valid. It's about personal preferences and what's acceptable for her. \n\nBut the challenge is whether her reason is justified. The argument against her is that it's an antique, not a weapon for immediate use, and she's making a judgment based on a stereotype (incel). On the other hand, if she's uncomfortable, that's her right. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, if she's making a judgment without fully understanding his reasons, perhaps. But she did confront him about it, and he tried to explain. She still felt it was a dealbreaker. \n\nSo, is she wrong? If the sword is a legitimate part of his heritage and she's breaking up over that, maybe she's in the wrong. But if she's uncomfortable with weapons in the home, even if it's an antique, then her choice is her business. \n\nI think it's more about personal choice here. She's not in the wrong for ending a relationship because of a personal red line. However, some might argue she's being overly judgmental without considering all factors. But others might say it's her prerogative. The subreddit's response might lean towards her not being an asshole because breaking up over personal discomfort isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
