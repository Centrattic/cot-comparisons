It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that she broke up with a guy because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author liked the guy a lot; they had a good time, met friends, and seemed compatible. But when she saw the sword, she immediately thought of negative stereotypes like incels or weapons for violence. The guy explained it was an antique from his grandfather, part of his family's history. She didn't seem to accept that explanation and decided to end the relationship.\n\nHer friends are saying she's being an asshole, implying she's overreacting. The guy's perspective would be that he was being honest about the sword's history and she judged him without considering his explanation. On the other hand, the author's reasoning is that she doesn't want to be with someone who has weapons, even if it's an antique. \n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are about judgment, communication, and personal boundaries. It's important to consider whether her reaction was reasonable. Owning an antique sword isn't inherently problematic, and many people collect such items. However, her fear stems from associating swords with violence or negative stereotypes. That's a personal feeling, but it's valid for her to have boundaries. \n\nBut breaking up over this might be seen as hasty. If she could have explored his explanation more and discussed her concerns, maybe there could have been a resolution. By not engaging further, she might have dismissed his side too quickly. However, if her comfort and safety are compromised by his ownership of a weapon, even if it's not a modern threat, that's her prerogative. \n\nIn relationship advice, communication is key. She did communicate her discomfort, but maybe not enough to give him a chance to explain further. The guy's reaction of feeling unimpressed might have been hurtful, but her decision was based on her own values. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. Her judgment might be seen as harsh by some, but her right to set boundaries is valid. The friends' reactions are about her handling it, not necessarily the decision itself. The question is whether her decision was justified by her own standards. If she's honest with herself, maybe she's not in the wrong for acting on her discomfort, even if others see it as overreacting. But if she didn't give the situation a fair chance, maybe she is. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because people have the right to set boundaries based on their personal comfort, even if others disagree. However, the execution of the breakup could have been handled better. But the core issue of the sword might not be her fault for feeling that way. So, B.\n"
