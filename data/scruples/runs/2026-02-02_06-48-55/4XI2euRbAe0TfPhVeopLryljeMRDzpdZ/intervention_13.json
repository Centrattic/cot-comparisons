It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they broke up with a guy because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. The guy is in the Navy, and the sword is an antique from his grandpa. The author was okay with the guy otherwise\u2014met his friends, they had a good time, but the sword was a dealbreaker for them. They didn't say anything at first, then brought it up later, and the guy tried to explain it's an antique. The author ended the relationship, and now some friends are saying they're acting like an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning is that they don't want to be with someone who owns weapons. But wait, the sword is an antique and not a functional weapon, right? The guy didn't have it for self-defense or anything; it's part of his family heirloom. Maybe the author overreacted because of stereotypes or a meme they saw. On the other hand, if someone has a weapon in their apartment, even if it's not used, some people might feel uncomfortable. But is that a valid reason to break up?\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. If the sword is just a decorative item and there's no real threat, then maybe the author is overreacting. The guy didn't ask for sex, he's in the Navy, friends liked him. The sword itself isn't a safety issue. However, personal boundaries matter. If the author feels that having weapons in the home is a red flag, then it's their choice. But the problem is that the sword isn't a weapon in the traditional sense\u2014it's an antique. So maybe the author is being too judgmental based on appearance rather than actual risk.\n\nAlso, the guy tried to explain the context, but the author dismissed it. That could indicate that the author is not considering his side. Breaking up over something that's not a real threat might be seen as unreasonable. The friends' reactions, saying they're making a mountain out of a molehill, support the idea that the author overreacted. However, if the author genuinely feels uncomfortable with weapons, even decorative ones, it's their right to prioritize their comfort in a relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the sword isn't a real threat and the author is making a big deal about it without cause, then maybe yes. But if they have a valid reason to be uncomfortable, even if others don't understand it, then no. The key is whether the sword posed any actual danger or if the author's reaction was based on irrational fears. Since the sword is an antique and part of family history, the author's reaction seems to stem from a stereotype or irrational fear rather than a real danger. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for breaking up over something trivial. Answer A (Yes).\n"
