It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with the guy because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author met someone on Tinder, they had a good time, and things were going well. The guy is a Navy pilot, which might be a detail that adds context. The issue came up when the author visited his apartment and saw a real sword. The author immediately thought of the \"incel\" stereotype and the meme about studying the blade, which made them uncomfortable. They didn't confront him immediately but later brought it up during a drive to a party. The guy explained the sword was an antique from his grandfather's time in Japan, worth a lot. The author dismissed the explanation, focusing on the sword being a weapon. After the party, the author broke up with him, and now friends are divided on whether the author was right.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's reaction to the sword, the guy's explanation, and the friends' conflicting opinions. The author's main concern seems to be about the sword being a weapon, but the guy provided a legitimate reason for owning it as an antique. The author dismissed the explanation and made a judgment based on their own assumptions. \n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The guy didn't hide the sword, and he had a valid reason for owning it. The author's hesitation might be based on a stereotype rather than the actual situation. However, the author has the right to feel uncomfortable and set boundaries. But maybe they should have communicated better or considered the explanation more seriously before breaking up. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy owning a sword might not be a deal-breaker, and the author's reaction might have been overly hasty. The friends suggest that the author is overreacting. But the author's discomfort is real, and they have the right to choose who they want to be in a relationship with. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for their feelings, but maybe they didn't handle the situation well. The question is whether their action (breaking up) was wrong. If the sword was a genuine concern (like if it was a weapon they felt unsafe with), then it's understandable. But since the guy explained it's an antique and not used for violence, the author's judgment might be unfounded. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is about trust or safety? If the author felt the sword indicated something negative about the guy (like he's into violent stuff), that's a personal judgment. However, without evidence of actual danger, it's more about the author's personal bias. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for making a snap judgment based on a stereotype rather than the guy's actual explanation. \n\nAlternatively, if the author felt unsafe, that's a valid reason. But since the guy had a legitimate reason, the author's reaction might be the issue. The friends think the author is acting like an asshole, which complicates things. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's reaction was reasonable. If the sword's presence was a legitimate safety concern, then no. But since it's an antique and not used for harm, the author's reaction might be based on unfounded assumptions. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the explanation and making a hasty decision.\n"
