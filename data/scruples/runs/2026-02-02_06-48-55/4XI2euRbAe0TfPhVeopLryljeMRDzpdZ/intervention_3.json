It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for breaking up with the guy because he had a ninja sword in his apartment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met the guy on Tinder, they had a good time, but when visiting his apartment, she saw a sword. She immediately associated it with the \"incel\" community and the meme about studying the blade. She didn't like that he owned a weapon and decided to break up. Her friends are telling her she's being an asshole, but she's unsure.\n\nSo, the main question is whether her reaction was justified. On one hand, the sword is an antique, part of his family's history, and not for stabbing people. On the other, she felt uncomfortable and didn't want to date someone with weapons. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both parties feel comfortable. If she's uncomfortable with weapons in the home, that's her right. But the sword's purpose was explained, so maybe she didn't give enough consideration. \n\nBut maybe the issue isn't just about the sword itself. It's about her immediate judgment based on stereotypes. If she's against weapons in principle, that's her choice. However, if the sword is an antique and not a threat, her reaction might be overblown. \n\nHer friends think she's making a mountain out of a molehill. Breaking up over a weapon that's not used for harm but is a family heirloom could be seen as her being too judgmental. However, if her values are against having weapons in the home, then it's a valid reason to end the relationship. \n\nBut the guy didn't have any history of violence, and the sword is an antique. So maybe her reaction was based on a stereotype rather than his actual behavior. That could make her the asshole. \n\nAlternatively, if she genuinely felt unsafe or couldn't reconcile that aspect, it's her choice. But the sword wasn't a threat. So, the answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she acted on a stereotype without considering the context.\n"
