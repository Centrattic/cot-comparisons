It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for breaking up with a guy because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy met on Tinder, they had a good time, but when visiting his apartment, she found a sword. She thought it was odd, associated it with \"incel\" culture (which is a toxic, extremist ideology in some corners of the internet), and decided to break things off. She didn't want to be with someone who owns weapons. The guy tried to explain it was an antique from his grandfather, but she wasn't swayed. Her friends think she's overreacting and acting like an asshole.\n\nNow, the main question: Is the author wrong? The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The key points are her reasoning for breaking up. She didn't give the guy a chance to fully explain the context of the sword. The sword is ancient, an artifact passed down, not a weapon for violent use. However, her immediate reaction was negative, linking it to incel culture. That could be a prejudice or misunderstanding. But on the other hand, she's within her right to end a relationship if she feels uncomfortable, especially if she has safety concerns. However, in this case, the sword is an antique, not a modern weapon. \n\nHer friends said she's acting like an asshole because the sword isn't a real threat. But she might have valid reasons. But if her reasoning is based on a stereotype (incel) without evidence, that's a problem. Also, she didn't give him a second chance after he tried to explain. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and if the person acted without understanding. Here, the author made a snap judgment based on a stereotype. The guy had a legitimate reason for the sword. So, even though she's allowed to have preferences, acting on a stereotype could make her the asshole. But if her safety is a concern, that's different. However, the sword is an antique, not a weapon for attack. \n\nSo, the answer is either A or B. The community might debate. If she's making an assumption without considering his explanation, she's in the wrong. If she's prioritizing her comfort and safety, maybe not. But the sword isn't a real threat. The friends think she's overreacting. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she made a judgment based on a stereotype and didn't give him a chance. However, others might argue that personal boundaries are valid. But the sword's context matters. If the guy had a legitimate reason, she shouldn't have judged. So I think the answer is A.\n"
