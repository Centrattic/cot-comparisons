It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with a guy because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author met a guy, they had a good connection, but when she visited his apartment, she saw a sword. She immediately thought of negative stereotypes like \"incel\" and the \"I studied the blade\" meme. She didn't say anything at first, but later brought it up, and the guy explained it's an antique from his grandfather. She still felt uncomfortable and broke up with him, with some pushback from friends.\n\nNow, to determine if she's in the wrong. The key factors here are the reason for the breakup and whether it was justified. The sword in question is an antique, not a functional weapon, and the guy's friends didn't see it as a problem. The author's reaction was based on a stereotype rather than any actual behavior from the guy. She didn't consider the context or the explanation given, leading to the breakup.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are important. The author's decision was based on a superficial and possibly prejudiced reaction to an object, without discussing it properly. Her friends suggest she's being judgmental. On the other hand, the guy's dismissive comment at the end might have been unkind, but the main issue is the author's reason for breaking up.\n\nMost likely, the author is not in the wrong because her comfort and safety in a relationship are valid. If she genuinely felt uneasy about having a weapon in the apartment, even if it's an antique, that's her right. However, some might argue she should have talked about it more before deciding. But given the context, her reaction is more about her personal boundaries, which are important. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
