It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with the guy over a ninja sword. The author is seeking validation or criticism from others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The guy had a sword in his apartment. The author felt uncomfortable because of the sword, even though he explained it was an antique. The author's friends thought she was overreacting. She broke up with him because of this. Now, the question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFrom one angle, the sword itself isn't inherently a bad thing. If it's an antique and not a weapon used for harm, maybe it's a collector's item. The guy had a legitimate explanation. The author dismissed his reasoning and focused on the sword as a red flag, which might be a hasty judgment. Her friends think she's being too harsh, suggesting that maybe she's overreacting without understanding the context.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to feel uncomfortable around weapons. If she's not okay with having weapons in her partner's home, that's a valid personal boundary. The guy didn't ask her out of the blue to have sex, which she appreciated. But the sword became a deal-breaker for her. Whether that's justified depends on her comfort level. However, maybe she should have considered his explanation more and discussed it instead of breaking up immediately.\n\nThe key points here are about judgment and communication. Did she give him a chance to explain properly? The guy tried to explain the sword's history, but she was dismissive. If she had a genuine safety concern about weapons, that's one thing, but if it's a cultural or personal dislike of swords, that's different. Her friends' reactions also indicate that others see her as overreacting. So, the author might be in the wrong because she made a snap judgment without fully considering his explanation and the context. Her decision to break up based solely on the sword, without further discussion or understanding, could be seen as hasty and not giving him the benefit of the doubt. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
