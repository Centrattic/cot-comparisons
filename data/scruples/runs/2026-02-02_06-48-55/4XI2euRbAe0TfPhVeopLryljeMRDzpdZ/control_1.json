It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with a guy because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. The story is from a Reddit post where the author is seeking advice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple had been dating for a month and hadn't had sex yet. The guy is a Navy pilot, and they seem to have a good connection. The breaking point was the discovery of the sword. The author is uncomfortable with weapons, which is a valid personal boundary. \n\nThe guy tried to explain the sword's history, but the author was focused on the weapon aspect. The friends are divided, with two thinking the author overreacted. The author feels they're justified, but others think they're being too judgmental.\n\nNow, the core issue is whether the reaction was reasonable. The sword is an antique, part of his family's history. The author's refusal to consider that context and their immediate association with \"incel\" or the \"I studied the blade\" meme might indicate a bias. However, the author's discomfort with weapons is personal and a matter of their own safety or comfort. \n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong. Breaking up based on a personal boundary isn't necessarily wrong. However, the judgment of the guy's background and the dismissal of his explanation could be seen as hasty. The friends' reactions suggest that having a sword isn't inherently problematic. But the author's decision is based on their own comfort, which is valid. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. On one hand, the author has the right to set boundaries. On the other, they might have been too quick to judge without fully understanding. But since the question is binary (A or B), and the author's action was based on their own values, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
