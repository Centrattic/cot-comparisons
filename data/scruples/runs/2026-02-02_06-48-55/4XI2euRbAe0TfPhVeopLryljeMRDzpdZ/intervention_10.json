It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with someone because he had a ninja sword in his apartment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author met the guy, had a good time, but when she visited his apartment and saw the sword, she felt uncomfortable. She associated it with incel stereotypes and the \"I studied the blade\" meme. She didn't say anything at first but later broke up with him over it.\n\nThe guy explained that the sword was an antique from his grandfather, who got it in Japan. He tried to explain its value and history. The author, however, was focused on the weapon aspect and didn't want to be with someone who owns weapons. The guy was hurt by her reaction, and her friends think she's overreacting.\n\nSo, is she wrong? Well, she had the right to feel uncomfortable. But maybe she didn't give him enough chance to explain. The sword was an antique, not something he used for harmful purposes. Her immediate assumption might be based on stereotypes. On the other hand, her right to set boundaries in a relationship is valid. If she can't overcome that, maybe it's her choice to break up. But was the reaction disproportionate? Her friends think she's being judgmental. The guy felt disrespected by her reaction. \n\nI think it's a balance. She has the right to her feelings, but maybe she didn't approach the situation with enough openness. Assuming he had a weapon without context might be hasty. However, her right to feel safe and set boundaries is important. But breaking up immediately without trying to understand his side could be seen as her being in the wrong. The guy was trying to explain, and she dismissed it. So maybe she is in the wrong because she didn't listen to his explanation and made a judgment based on a stereotype.\n"
