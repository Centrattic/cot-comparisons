It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person broke up with their boyfriend because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. The guy explained that it's an antique from his grandfather, but the author was concerned about the sword being a weapon and didn't want to be with someone who owns weapons. The friends are divided, with two saying the author is being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's reaction is justified. The sword is an antique, part of his family's history. Maybe he's into martial arts or has a legitimate interest in historical items. The author immediately associated it with \"incel\" and the \"I studied the blade\" meme, which suggests a negative stereotype. That might be a hasty judgment without considering the context.\n\nBut then again, the author is allowed to have boundaries. If they are uncomfortable with weapons in the home, that's their personal choice. However, the decision to break up solely over a decorative antique sword might be seen as overreacting. The guy didn't use the sword as a threat; it was just in his apartment. The author didn't ask about it first, but when confronted, they didn't seem open to his explanation.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone has a deep-seated fear of weapons, maybe it's a valid reason to not be in a relationship with someone who owns them. But the friends' reactions varied, some found it cool, others thought the author was overreacting. The key point is whether the author's judgment was unfair. The guy's friends seemed okay, so maybe the sword isn't an issue for others. The author's reaction might be based on prejudice rather than the actual facts. \n\nThe guy did try to explain the history, but the author dismissed it. That could indicate the author wasn't willing to listen, which might be where they're in the wrong. However, if the author is not comfortable with weapons, it's a personal choice to end the relationship. The question is if the action was unreasonable. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they made a snap judgment without fully considering the explanation and the item's nature. Or B (not in the wrong) because personal boundaries are valid. It's a bit of a toss-up, but since the sword was an antique and not a threat, the author's reaction was possibly unfounded, making them the asshole.\n"
