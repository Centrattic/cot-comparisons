It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with someone because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. I need to figure out whether the answer is A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nFirst, I'll go through the details of the situation. The author met this guy on Tinder, they had a good time, and things were going well. Then, when visiting his apartment, they saw a sword. The author immediately associated it with \"incel\" stereotypes and the meme about studying the blade. They didn't say anything at first but became quiet and uncomfortable. When the guy tried to explain the sword's history as an antique from his grandfather, the author couldn't get past the idea of it being a weapon. They ended up breaking up, and now their friends are telling them they're being an asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the sword is an antique, part of family history, and not for practical use. The author's reaction was based on a stereotype or fear, not the actual intent of the item. The guy didn't do anything to suggest he was dangerous; the sword was just there. The author's friends think they're overreacting, which adds to the complexity.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The guy owning a sword, especially an antique, isn't inherently a red flag. Unless there's a history of violence or the sword is used inappropriately, it's more of a personal discomfort. The author's judgment based on a stereotype (like incel) might be unfounded. They didn't give the guy a real chance to explain or address the concern. The breakup was based on a superficial reason, and the friends' reactions suggest that others don't see it as a big issue. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to feel uncomfortable and to set boundaries. If they associate the sword with something negative, even if it's irrational, it's their choice to end the relationship. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. The term \"asshole\" is pretty strong. The friends might think they should try to get over their bias, but the author's own feelings are valid. However, the way they reacted\u2014without really engaging with the explanation\u2014might be seen as hasty or judgmental. The guy's reaction of being upset and giving a \"last shot\" also indicates that he felt disrespected. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they made a snap judgment based on a stereotype and didn't give the situation more consideration. The sword itself isn't a legitimate reason to break up, especially without evidence of intent to harm. The friends' advice to apologize or at least consider a second chance implies that the author's reaction was excessive. However, the author isn't obligated to date someone if they feel uncomfortable. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the judgment is more about acting without proper understanding. \n\nThe answer is probably A, but I'm a bit conflicted. The author's right to their feelings is there, but the way they handled it might be the issue. The friends think they're an asshole, so the community might agree. I think the answer is A.\n"
