It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about breaking up with someone because he had a ninja sword in his apartment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author had a good experience initially with this guy, met his friends, things were going well. Then when visiting his apartment, she notices a sword and immediately starts thinking negative things like \"incel\" and the meme about studying the blade. She didn't confront him immediately but when asked, she expressed her discomfort. The guy tried to explain it's an antique from his grandfather, but she wasn't convinced. She ended up breaking up because she doesn't want to be with someone who owns weapons. Her friends think she's overreacting and being an asshole.\n\nNow, to decide if she's in the wrong. The key points are: Is owning a ninja sword a legitimate reason to break up? The sword is an antique, not something he bought for modern use. She mentions he's in the Navy, maybe he got it from his grandfather who was also in the Navy. So the sword is a family heirloom. But she's judging him based on stereotypes about weapons and incels. Incels are associated with violence, but that's a stereotype. The sword itself is a weapon, but in this case, it's an antique with historical value. \n\nHer reaction seems based on fear and prejudice. She acknowledges she's being judgmental but can't think of a legitimate reason for him to have a sword. However, the guy provided an explanation, but she dismissed it. Communication is important in a relationship. She could have discussed her fears and maybe found a middle ground. Ending the relationship immediately might be hasty. On the other hand, if her comfort is a priority, maybe it's valid. But the friends think she's overreacting. \n\nIs her reaction reasonable? It depends on perspective. If she has real concerns about violence or feels unsafe, that's a legitimate reason. But in this case, the sword is an antique, not a modern weapon. She didn't express a safety concern but a discomfort with weapons in general. So, maybe she is being too judgmental. The guy might not have realized how much it would bother her, but she should have communicated her feelings earlier. However, breaking up over it might be a valid choice for her, even if others think she's wrong. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for breaking up. If she's not wrong for prioritizing her comfort, then B. But if she's wrong for making a snap judgment without fully considering the explanation, then A. The friends' opinions are mixed, but two think she's in the wrong. The community's take might depend on whether the sword is a red flag or a misunderstanding. Since it's an antique and he's a pilot in the Navy, maybe it's a genuine heirloom. Her reaction seems based on stereotype rather than facts. So, she might be in the wrong for not giving him the benefit of the doubt and breaking up without considering his explanation. Therefore, answer A.\n"
