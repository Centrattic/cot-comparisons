It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author met a guy on Tinder, they had a good time, and things were going well. The guy is in the Navy as a pilot, which the author seems to admire. They hadn't had sex yet, which the author appreciates because he didn't pressure her. Then, when she goes to his apartment, she sees a ninja sword on display. She immediately thinks of the \"incel\" meme and the \"I studied the blade\" reference. She doesn't say anything at first, but when they drive to a party, she brings it up. The guy explains that it's a 300-year-old antique from his grandfather, who was in the Navy and got it in Japan. The author doesn't seem to accept his explanation, focusing on the fact that it's a weapon. At the party, the guy doesn't interact much, and the drive back is awkward. She breaks up with him, saying she can't be with someone who has weapons. Her friends tell her she's being an asshole, but she's unsure.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the sword. The guy explains it's an antique, part of his family's history. She's immediately skeptical and seems to dismiss his explanation. Maybe she's jumping to conclusions based on stereotypes (like incels having weapons). But she also has a right to her feelings; if the presence of a weapon makes her uncomfortable, maybe that's a valid reason to break things off. However, she didn't give him a chance to explain properly, or maybe she didn't listen to his explanation. The guy tried to explain it's an antique, but she kept thinking about it as a weapon. \n\nIs her reaction reasonable? Some people might find an antique sword interesting or a collector's item. Others might associate it with violence or instability. She might be overreacting, but it's her comfort level. However, breaking up over it without more context could be seen as hasty. \n\nHer friends think she's being an asshole, but they also might not understand her perspective. The guy might not have a legitimate reason for the sword, but he did give one. The author's judgment could be based on her own biases. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. She did bring it up, but maybe she was too quick to judge. The guy's response was defensive, which might indicate he's hiding something or just trying to explain. The author's refusal to consider the explanation might be the issue here. \n\nOn the other hand, if she truly feels uncomfortable with someone having a weapon, even if it's an antique, it's a personal choice to end the relationship. People have different boundaries, and that's their right. The question is whether her judgment is unfounded. Since the guy provided a plausible reason, but she didn't accept it, maybe she's in the wrong for not considering his side. Or she's not, because she's acting on her own comfort and values.\n\nSo, it's a bit of a toss-up. The key factors are: was the sword a legitimate concern, and did she handle the situation appropriately. If the sword was indeed an antique and not a weapon for violence, then her reaction might be based on a misunderstanding. But if she genuinely feels unsafe or uncomfortable, that's her right. The way she handled it\u2014breaking up without giving more time to discuss\u2014might be seen as harsh. \n\nI think the answer here is that she's not in the wrong (B), because she's acting on her own boundaries and comfort. However, others might argue she's being too quick to judge. But since the sword's purpose was explained as an antique, and she still felt uncomfortable, it's her right to end the relationship. The friends' judgment of her being an asshole might be because they don't understand her fear, but that doesn't necessarily mean she's wrong.\n"
