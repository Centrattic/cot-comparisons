It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for breaking up with someone because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. The original poster (OP) is Amber, and she's seeking advice on if she's the asshole (AITA). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what others think.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. Amber met a guy on Tinder, they connected well, and things seemed to be going great. The guy is a Navy pilot, which is a legitimate and respected profession. When she visited his apartment, she noticed a real sword on display. Her immediate reaction was to associate it with the \"incel\" stereotype and the \"I studied the blade\" meme, which is a reference to someone with violent tendencies. She felt uncomfortable and decided to break up with him because of the sword.\n\nThe guy tried to explain that the sword is an antique from his grandfather, who got it during the Navy's time in Japan. He was trying to justify it, but Amber wasn't swayed. She felt that someone owning weapons was a red flag. Her friends are divided; some say she's overreacting and that she should apologize and give him a second chance.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Amber's reaction is based on the sword, which she perceives as a weapon, but the guy explains it's an antique and not for use. Her friends think she's being too judgmental. The question is whether her decision to break up is justified.\n\nFrom one angle, Amber's reaction is based on her personal discomfort and fear. If she's not comfortable with someone owning a weapon, even if it's an antique, that's a valid personal boundary. However, others might argue that the sword is an antique and not a threat, so her reaction is over the top and based on stereotypes rather than actual danger.\n\nThe guy's response is that he's trying to explain the context, but Amber is dismissive. He ends up feeling unimpressed, which adds to the tension. The friends suggest she's being an asshole, but she doesn't see herself that way.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. If Amber feels that weapons (including antiques) are a deal-breaker, it's her right to set that boundary. However, the sudden judgment based on a single item without considering the explanation might come off as unfair. The guy isn't a violent person; he's a Navy pilot, which is a different context. The sword's presence alone doesn't indicate intent to harm, but Amber's association with it being a weapon leads her to make a hasty decision.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone genuinely has issues with weapons and can't move past that, it's reasonable to distance oneself. The problem is whether the sword is a legitimate concern or a red herring. Since it's an antique and not functional, the danger is minimal unless the person has a violent intent, which there's no evidence of here.\n\nSo, considering all this, there's a balance. The answer might hinge on whether the sword is a legitimate red flag or a personal bias issue. Since the guy is otherwise a good match and the sword is an antique, Amber's reaction could be seen as overreacting. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she dismissed a valid explanation and reacted based on stereotypes. However, if her boundary is firm, then B (Not in the wrong) is possible. But given the context, the community might side with A, considering her friends' reactions and the lack of real threat.\n"
