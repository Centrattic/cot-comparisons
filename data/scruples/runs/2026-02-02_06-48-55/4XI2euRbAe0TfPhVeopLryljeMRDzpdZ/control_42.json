It was a super like for me because he was cute and funny and didn't take himself to seriously. We met up and had a phenomenal time doing mini-golf and ice cream and honestly it was such a nice break from the usual Tinder dates that I really started to like him. He met my friends, my friends really liked him. He's like some sort of pilot in the Navy and I met his friends and they all seemed really cool and I was like wow...this is actually working!\n We hadn't had sex yet, but I have to be honest him not even asking was a really nice change. \n\n\nSo I went to his apartment for the first time on Sunday afternoon to so he could pick up his Ram's gear. It was a pretty normal single guy apartment and my initial thought was \"this is enough to really need my help...I can work with this.\" But then I saw he had a sword on this rack on top of a bookshelf. Like a real sword you see in like ninja movies or whatever. Literally all I could think about was \"incel\" and that \"I studied the blade\" meme. Maybe I'm too judgmental but I can't think of any legitimate reason why he would need a sword. It seemed so stupid. \n\nSo I didn't say anything but we had like an hour drive to my friends superbowl party.  he must have noticed I got quiet so he asked me if something was wrong. I said I just wasn't sure to think  about someone having a sword in their apartment.  He came up with this ridiculous story that the sword is actually like 300 years old and his Grandpa had gotten it as a gift when he'd been in Japan with the Navy after the war because his grandpa had been one of the first white people to take Karate or whatever from this old family. I was like yeah but it's a sword...a sword...to like stab people with.  He kept trying to tell me that in reality its an antique and worth a ton of money. He could have explained that it was magic and cured cancer but literally all I could think about was it's a sword. He just kept trying to talk circles around the subject but I just wasn't hearing it because very honestly, I don't want to be with a guy who owns weapons. Like what in the fuck?\n\n\nSo we got to the party and it was awkward as hell. Like he just sat there and watched the game and didn't interact with me very much at all. Since the game was so boring, really only he and one other guy watched it. I tried to tell my friends about the sword and they didn't seem to get my point either because their reactions ranged from \"wow, that's kind of cool\" to \"Amber, maybe your making a mountain out of a molehill.\" \n\n\nSo the drive back was even worse and we barely spoke a word. When I dropped him off I basically said \"look, you're a nice guy, I just can't date a guy with weapons in his house.\" He said that my reaction didn't really impress him either which actually upset me that he get a last shot in like that. \nBut he left without incident and all that's left to do is I need to return his playstation that he brought over to my house. \n\n\nTwo of my friends are telling me that I'm literally acting like an asshole and that everything that this guy brings to the table I either need to get over myself and the sword or at least apologize to him and see if maybe he'll give me a second chance. \n\nI don't think I'm an asshole, but two of my most trusted people on the planet just told me I am. \n\n\nSo to this sub...am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they broke up with a guy because he had a ninja sword in his apartment. The guy is a Navy pilot, and the sword is an antique that his grandpa got from Japan after the war. The author is uncomfortable because they associate swords with something like incel stuff or weapons for violence. The guy tried to explain it's an antique, but the author still felt they couldn't be with someone who owns a weapon.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that they don't want to be with someone who has weapons, which is their personal choice. But the guy's side is that the sword is an antique, not a weapon for immediate use, and part of his family's history. \n\nThe question is whether the author overreacted. The friends think they're being judgmental, while the author feels it's a valid reason. Breaking up over this might be seen as a personal choice, but maybe they didn't give enough context. The guy explained the sword's history, but the author didn't seem to accept it. \n\nIs owning a sword inherently wrong? No, but if the author has a strong aversion to weapons, maybe it's a dealbreaker for them. However, if the sword is an antique and displayed, it's not being used as a weapon. The author's reaction might be based on stereotypes (like the \"incel\" association) rather than the reality of the item. \n\nAlso, communication is key. The author didn't address the issue directly until the date, which might have caused awkwardness. But they did explain their feelings. The guy's friends found it cool, so maybe the author's perspective is more about personal discomfort than an actual danger. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't breaking any laws by breaking up. But if the sword wasn't a real threat, the breakup might be based on misunderstanding. However, the author has the right to their own boundaries. The guy's reaction of feeling disrespected might be valid too, especially if he felt the sword was unfairly judged. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is being unreasonable. If the sword was non-threatening and the author is letting stereotypes influence their decision, they might be in the wrong. But if they have a legitimate personal boundary against weapons, they aren't. The question is whether their reaction was justified. Since the sword is an antique and not a weapon for immediate use, the author's reaction might be overblown. So maybe they are the asshole (A). But if someone's personal comfort is a valid reason, then they aren't (B). It's a bit of a toss-up. The key is whether the sword posed a risk. If not, then the author's choice is more about personal preference and maybe bias. Hence, answer A.\n"
