From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a date with a guy, and he was uncomfortable because she was taller than him. She was wearing heels, which made her about 4 inches taller than him. He asked if she had to wear those heels, which the author interpreted as a joke or a way to break the tension. She then responded by saying, \"Well, do you have to be so short?\" He didn't laugh, got sullen, and left. Now she's wondering if she was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around comments about physical attributes. Commenting on someone's height can be a sensitive topic because height is an inherent trait that people can't change. The guy was already uncomfortable about the height difference, as shown by his comment about the heels. When the author responded by calling him short, that directly addressed his insecurity. Even if she thought it was a joke, it's possible that he found it offensive. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy did bring up the height difference by commenting on the heels. So he might have been trying to address the issue, but in a way that could be seen as a complaint. If he was trying to make light of it with a joke, but she took it seriously and then countered with a jab, that could escalate things. However, her response was a direct comment on his height, which is a personal and unchangeable trait. That might be crossing a line, even if he initiated the conversation about height. \n\nBut wait, he did ask, \"Did you have to wear those heels?\" Maybe he was trying to make a joke, but if he was uncomfortable, perhaps he was hinting that he would prefer not to be shorter. By responding with a jab about his height, she might have been reacting to his implied insecurity in a way that was hurtful. Even if he started the conversation, her response was a personal attack. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that she's aware of her height, so maybe she felt the comment about heels was rude. But comparing the two, the guy's comment was about her choice (heels), which is changeable, whereas her comment was about his height, which is not. However, the guy's question might have been a way of expressing discomfort without directly saying he's short. \n\nIn social situations, making a joke about someone's height, even if they brought up the topic, can be seen as insensitive. The key here is that the author's response was a direct jab at his height, which is a sensitive issue for him. Even if she thought it was a joke, it didn't land well and led to the date ending badly. \n\nSo, while the guy brought up the topic, the author's response was probably the more hurtful one. Therefore, she might be in the wrong for making a comment about his height, even if he initiated the conversation. But is it entirely her fault? Maybe the guy was also inconsiderate by bringing up the heels in a way that made the situation awkward. However, the question is about the author's actions. Given that she directly called him short in a way that he didn't find funny, it's likely she was in the wrong. \n\nBut I need to check if there's a nuance. If he was being rude by bringing up the heels as a complaint, then she was just responding in kind. But the heels are her choice, and his comment could be seen as a way of expressing discomfort. If she took it as a joke and responded with a joke, but it backfired, maybe both are at fault. However, the author is asking if she's in the wrong. \n\nIn most cases, making a joke about someone's height is considered more offensive than commenting on someone else's choice of footwear. So the author's response might be the main issue here. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
