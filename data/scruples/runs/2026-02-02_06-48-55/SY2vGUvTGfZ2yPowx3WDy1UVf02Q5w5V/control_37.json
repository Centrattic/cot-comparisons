From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called their date \"short\" is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author went on a date with a guy who was uncomfortable because she was taller. He asked if she had to wear heels, implying the height difference was an issue. The author responded by calling him short, which he took as a jab, leading to the date ending poorly.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought she was making a joke. She mentions expecting him to laugh. But the guy took it seriously and felt insecure. Height is an inherent trait he can't change, so making a comment about it could be hurtful, even if intended as a joke. The author didn't consider his feelings here.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy initiated the conversation about the heels, which might have been his way of bringing up the height difference. If he was being rude by pointing out her heels, maybe the author felt justified in responding. However, responding by calling him short directly addresses his insecurity. Even if the guy started it, the author's response could have been perceived as attacking his personal characteristic, which is sensitive.\n\nIn terms of social norms, teasing about something someone is insecure about is generally frowned upon. The guy's comment about the heels was a bit of a lead-in, but the author's retort escalated it. Since she's in a position where she could see he was uncomfortable, she should have been more considerate. Also, height is a fixed trait, so commenting on it can be more hurtful than a choice like wearing heels. \n\nThe author's intention was to joke, but the impact was negative. When in doubt, it's better to apologize for the remark and acknowledge the other person's feelings. Since the guy clearly felt bad, the author's response crossed a line. So, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
