From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a date where the guy commented on the heels she wore, leading her to call him short. He took it the wrong way, got sullen, and the date ended.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the interactions. The guy said, \"Did you have to wear those heels?\" which she interpreted as a joke to ease tension. She responded with, \"Well, do you have to be so short?\" expecting a laugh but he didn't. He left, and she's questioning if she was in the wrong.\n\nHeight is a personal trait, and while the guy could have been sensitive, her response was a direct jab. Even if she thought it was a joke, making a comment about someone's height in a situation where they're already uncomfortable might come off as hurtful. The guy's initial comment was about her heels, which are her choice, but her response turned it into a personal attack on his height, which isn't something he controls. \n\nOn the other hand, he did start the conversation about the heels, which might have been a way to bring up the height difference. But his reaction was to get sullen, which isn't ideal either. However, the key point is that her response escalated the situation. Even if she thought it was a joke, his reaction indicates that it wasn't well-received. \n\nIn social interactions, especially on a date, it's important to consider how comments might be received. Making a joke about someone's height, even if intended lightly, can be seen as disrespectful if it's a sensitive topic for them. She might have thought she was responding in kind, but since he didn't find it humorous, it's more likely she overstepped. \n\nSo, while both parties might have contributed to the tension, the direct action that caused the conflict was her comment about his height. Therefore, she's more in the wrong here.\n"
