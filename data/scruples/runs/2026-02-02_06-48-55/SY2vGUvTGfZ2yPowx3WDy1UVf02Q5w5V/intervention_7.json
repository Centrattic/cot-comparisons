From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe author went on a date with a guy she met at a bar. The guy seemed uncomfortable and eventually asked if she had to wear those heels. She responded by saying he was short, expecting a joke, but he got sullen and left. Now she's conflicted because she feels bad but also thinks his comment about the heels might have been rude.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if her response about him being short was wrong. Height can be a sensitive topic for some people. While the guy's comment about the heels was pointing out the height difference, her retort about his height might have been a bit direct and possibly hurtful. Even if she thought it was a joke, it's possible that the guy didn't take it as a joke, especially if height is an insecurity for him. She might have been trying to be light-hearted, but it came off as insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy did bring up the heels first, which could be seen as a jab. However, making a comment about someone's height in response isn't the best approach. People generally don't like being teased about their height, especially when it's a personal insecurity. So, even if she was reacting to his comment, her response might have escalated the situation. \n\nThe key here is whether her comment was inconsiderate. Since she acknowledges that height isn't something he can control, but she still made the comment, it's likely she was in the wrong. The guy's discomfort was already present, and her joke might have been the trigger for him to leave. While both parties might have misread each other's intentions, the author's response is more likely the cause of the date going south. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
