From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the question is whether the person who called their date \"short\" is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy was uncomfortable with her heels, which made her taller than him. She thought he was joking when he asked if she had to wear those heels, and then she retorted by saying he's short. He got sullen and left.\n\nHmm. First, I need to break down the interactions. The guy was uncomfortable with the height difference. He asked if she had to wear those heels, which could be a way to address the issue. She then responded by pointing out his height. He left, and the date bombed.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, she thought he was making a joke. But he wasn't, and she made a comment about his height. That's the crux. Now, height is a physical attribute that can't be changed, so making a comment about someone's height could be seen as targeting something they can't control. That might be the problem here. Even if she thought he was making a joke, he wasn't, so her retort was a bit harsh. \n\nBut on the other hand, he did bring up her heels first. However, his comment about the heels might have been a way to express his discomfort, maybe even in a semi-joking way. If he wasn't in a good mood or was really insecure about his height, a joke about his own height might not have been his intention. So when she responded with \"do you have to be so short,\" it's a direct jab at his insecurity. \n\nIn social interactions, it's often considered polite to avoid commenting on things that people can't change, like height, unless it's in a lighthearted and consensual way. Since this was a date where he was already uncomfortable, her response might have crossed a line. Even if she thought he was joking, if he was being sincere about his discomfort, her response could be seen as unkind or dismissive of his feelings. \n\nBut then again, he did start the conversation about the height difference. So maybe he was trying to address it, but she misread it as a joke. However, when he asked about the heels, maybe he just wanted to address the situation without making it personal. Her response made it personal, which led to the conflict. \n\nI think the key here is that while height is a sensitive topic, if he had made a joke about his own height first, her response might be a playful retort. But in this case, he was expressing discomfort, and she turned it back on him. So, she's in the wrong for making a comment about his height in a situation where he was already uncomfortable. Unless he was trying to be a joke, but she misread it. But since he didn't laugh and got sullen, it's more likely that her comment was hurtful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
