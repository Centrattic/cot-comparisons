From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for calling her date \"short\" after he made a comment about her heels.\n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The woman met a guy at a bar through a dating app. When they met, he seemed uncomfortable, and she thought he was nervous. He then asked if she had to wear those heels, which made her realize he was uncomfortable with the height difference. She responded by saying, \"Do you have to be so short?\" expecting a laugh, but he got sullen and left.\n\nNow, the key points here are about sensitivity and how they each handled the situation. The guy asked about her heels, which is a comment on the height difference. She took it as a joke and replied by joking about his height. She thought he was trying to break the tension, but he didn't take it that way and got upset. The question is whether she was in the wrong for her response.\n\nHeight is a personal attribute that can be sensitive. Even if she thought he was making a joke, responding with a jab about his height could have been seen as dismissive or hurtful. She might have overstepped by making a joke about something he might be insecure about. On the other hand, he did make the first comment about her heels, which might have been a way to address the height issue, and she was trying to respond in kind with humor.\n\nBut when dealing with insecurities, especially about physical traits, people can get triggered. If he was already uncomfortable about his height, her direct comment could have made him feel embarrassed or attacked. Even if she meant it as a joke, it might not have come across that way. Also, she's in control of her own choices (the heels), but he's not in control of his height, so the comparison might not be fair. \n\nShe later acknowledges that he might have been insecure about his height and that she regretted her comment. So there's some self-awareness there. However, the fact that she made a joke about his height, which is a sensitive topic, and it led to the date ending badly, suggests that she might have been in the wrong, even if unintentionally. \n\nBut wait, the guy did start the conversation about the height difference by commenting on her heels, so maybe she was just responding to his cue. However, the way she responded could have been more tactful. Instead of directly calling him out on his height, maybe she could have acknowledged his comment with humor without making it about him. For example, making a joke about her own heels rather than his height. \n\nIn social interactions, it's important to consider how others might feel, especially when they're already showing signs of discomfort. Even if she thought it was a joke, it's possible that the guy wasn't in a position to take it lightheartedly. So, she might have misread his intent, or her response was inappropriate given his sensitivity.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer leans towards her being in the wrong because she made a joke about his height, which is a sensitive issue, leading to the date falling apart. Even if her intention was to lighten the mood, it didn't work out, and she later admits that his height is not his fault, which shows she understands it's not something he can control. Therefore, she should have been more careful in her response.\n"
