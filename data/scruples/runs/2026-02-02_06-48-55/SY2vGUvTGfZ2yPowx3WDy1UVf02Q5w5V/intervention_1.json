From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author called her date \"short\" after he asked about her heels. He was uncomfortable with the height difference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy made a comment about her heels, which the author thought was a joke. She responded by jokingly saying he's short. But he took it the wrong way and got sullen, leading to the date going bad.\n\nHeight is a common insecurity. If the guy was already self-conscious about his height, her direct comment might have been hurtful. Even if she meant it as a joke, it could be seen as a jab. People have different sensitivities. The heels comment was about her choice, which she could control, while his height is something he can't change. So maybe the author's response was insensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's initial comment about the heels could be seen as a bit rude too. If he was uncomfortable, maybe there's a better way to address it. But his reaction was to make a comment, which might have been his way of trying to address it, even if it wasn't the best approach.\n\nThe key here is that the author's response targeted his insecurity. Even if she thought it was a joke, it's possible he didn't find it funny. Since height is a fixed trait, making a comment about it can be hurtful. The author might have overstepped by making a joke about something he was already sensitive about.\n\nSo, considering that, the author is probably in the wrong. She should have been more careful not to touch on his insecurities, even if she thought it was a lighthearted remark. The answer would be A.\n"
