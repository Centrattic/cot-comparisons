From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling their date \"short.\" The situation is that they met a guy at a bar, and during the date, he commented on her heels, making her realize he was uncomfortable with the height difference. She then retorted by saying, \"Well, do you have to be so short?\" which made him sulk and the date to bomb.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The guy started by asking about her heels, which brought up the height issue. The author thought it was a joke and responded with a joke back. But he didn't take it that way and left. The key here is whether her response was appropriate.\n\nHeight is a personal attribute, not a choice. The guy's comment about the heels might have been a way to address the height difference, but he didn't come out and say it directly. The author's reply could be seen as a put-down, even if she intended it as a joke. People often take comments about height as sensitive. By calling him \"short,\" she might have hit a nerve, especially if he's self-conscious about it. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's initial comment about the heels could be perceived as rude or making a point about her choice, which might have been a lead-in for her to adjust. But since the author didn't do that and instead made a humorous jab, it escalated the situation. The author acknowledges that the guy's height isn't something he can control, which makes her comment potentially more hurtful.\n\nBut then again, the guy didn't handle it well either. If he was uncomfortable, maybe he should have communicated it more directly without expecting her to read between the lines. However, the author's response was a direct reply to his comment, which might have been a joke, but she took it as a challenge and responded with her own jab.\n\nIn social interactions, jokes can be misinterpreted. The author's response, while possibly intended as light-hearted, could be seen as dismissive or mocking. Especially since the guy was already uncomfortable. The onus is on the person making the joke to be aware of the other person's feelings, but since it's a mutual exchange, maybe both are at fault. However, the question is specifically about the author's responsibility. \n\nThe author's comment focused on the guy's insecurities, which might not be the best way to handle it. Even if the guy's comment was a bit passive-aggressive, responding with a joke about his height might have crossed a line. So the author could be in the wrong here. \n\nBut the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. They mention he got very sully and left quickly, so maybe his reaction was over the top. The user is conflicted but leaning towards the author being in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. Even if the guy's comment was a bit abrupt, the author's response directly addressed a sensitive topic and used sarcasm, which likely made him feel worse. The author should have considered that the guy might be uncomfortable and handled it more diplomatically instead of making a joke that could be hurtful.\n"
