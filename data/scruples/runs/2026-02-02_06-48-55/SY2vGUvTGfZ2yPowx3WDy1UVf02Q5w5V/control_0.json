From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling their date \"short\" during a date. The situation is a bit of a back-and-forth.\n\nFirst, the guy met the author at a bar and was uncomfortable. She thought maybe he was nervous. He asked if she had to wear heels, which made her realize he was uncomfortable about the height difference. She responded by saying \"do you have to be so short?\" expecting a joke but he got sullen and the date ended.\n\nSo, the author is questioning if she was at fault here. On one hand, she's aware that height isn't something he can control. On the other hand, he called her out on her heels, which was a choice she made. She thought he was making a joke to ease tension but she took it as a jab.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The guy's comment about the heels might have been a way to address the height difference, possibly trying to make a joke or express his feelings. The author's response was a retort pointing out his height. But he didn't find it funny, which escalated the situation.\n\nIs calling someone \"short\" inherently wrong? It depends on the context and the people involved. If someone is sensitive about their height, then making a comment about it can be hurtful. Even if it's meant as a joke, if it's not taken well, it's still problematic. The author might not have intended to be mean, but the comment targeted an insecurity. \n\nOn the flip side, the guy's initial question about the heels could be seen as a bit rude. Pointing out her heels as the reason for discomfort might come off as critical. But if he was uncomfortable, maybe he should have addressed it more tactfully. However, the author's response was a direct jab at his height, which is a sensitive topic for many.\n\nSo, considering that the guy's comment was about her choice (heels), which is something she had control over, versus her comment about his height, which he can't control. The author's response might have been more hurtful because it targeted a personal attribute. Even if she thought it was a joke, it's possible he felt mocked. \n\nIn social situations, it's usually better to avoid making comments about people's physical attributes, especially those they can't change. The author's comment, even if in jest, might have crossed a line. The guy's initial comment, while maybe not the best, was about a choice she made. So, maybe the author is in the wrong here for responding with a remark about his height, which he's likely sensitive about. The key point is that the author's response targeted a personal insecurity, which is generally considered rude.\n"
