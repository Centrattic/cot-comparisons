From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she went on a date with a guy, and he was uncomfortable because she was wearing heels, making her about 4 inches taller than him. He asked if she had to wear those heels, and she responded by saying \"Well, do you have to be so short?\" Then he got sulkier and the date ended badly.\n\nHmm, the user is asking if she's in the wrong. Let me break this down. First, the guy brought up her heels, which could be a polite way to address the height difference. He might have been nervous about it. She took it as a joke and retorted with a comment about his height. Now, calling someone \"short\" is a direct jab at their height, which is an inherent trait they can't change. That's probably not a good move because it's a sensitive topic for many people.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy did start the conversation about her heels, which might have been his way of expressing his discomfort. But maybe he was trying to find a solution (like her not wearing heels) instead of attacking his own height. However, the way he phrased it could come off as a bit passive-aggressive. But when she responded by attacking his height, that's crossing a line. People often have insecurities about things like height, so commenting on that can be hurtful.\n\nShe says she thought he was trying to break the tension, but maybe he was just expressing his discomfort. Either way, her response was a direct jab. Even if she thought it was a joke, it's possible he wasn't in the mood for it, especially if he's already feeling self-conscious. The guy's reaction getting sully and leaving quickly suggests that her comment hurt his feelings or made him feel disrespected. \n\nIn terms of who is at fault, it's possible that both acted in ways that could be seen as rude, but the author's comment about his height is more directly targeting something personal and unchangeable. The guy did make a comment about the heels, which is a choice she made, but the way she responded might have been more hurtful. So maybe the author is more in the wrong here. But I should also consider if the guy's initial comment was unkind. If he was just trying to address the situation, then her response was more problematic. If he was being rude, then maybe both are at fault. However, based on the description, the guy's comment seems like a genuine expression of discomfort rather than an insult. Therefore, the author's response was the more hurtful one. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
