From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault here. The situation is that she went on a date and called her date \"short\" when he commented on her heels. She's asking if she was wrong for that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy she met on a dating app was uncomfortable when they met, and she thought it might be because of the height difference. He asked if she had to wear those heels, which she took as a joke trying to break the tension. She responded by joking about his height. He didn't laugh and left. Now she's wondering if she was in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are about humor, sensitivity, and assumptions. She assumed he was making a joke and responded in kind. However, he might have been serious or sensitive about his height. Her response could have been hurtful if he wasn't comfortable with the topic. \n\nHeight is a common insecurity, and while it's not something he can control, making a joke about it could come across as insensitive. Even if she thought it was a joke, if he took it the wrong way, maybe she should have considered that it's not a subject he's comfortable with. \n\nOn the other hand, he did bring up the heels first, which might have been his way of initiating some light-heartedness. She reciprocated, but perhaps she overstepped. It's possible that while he was making a joke, he still wasn't comfortable with the height issue, and her response was too direct. \n\nIt's also possible that the guy wasn't trying to joke but was actually making a comment on her heels, perhaps implying that he felt self-conscious. Her response might have been a bit defensive or dismissive. \n\nIn terms of social norms, making jokes about someone's height can be seen as rude, even if the person is joking. People have different sensitivities, and what one person finds funny, another might not. Since he left quickly, it's clear he was offended. \n\nHer reasoning is that she thought it was a mutual joke, but maybe she didn't read the situation correctly. She acknowledges that his height is not his fault, but she still made a comment about it. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the intention was to keep the conversation light, the result was that he felt hurt. In such situations, it's important to consider the other person's feelings. The author might have been wrong in making that comment because it led to a negative outcome, even if it was a joke. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
