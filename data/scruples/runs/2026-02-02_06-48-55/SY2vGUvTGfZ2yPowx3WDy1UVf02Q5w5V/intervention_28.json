From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author called her date \"short\" after he commented on her heels, leading to the date going bad.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The guy was uncomfortable from the start. He asked if she had to wear those heels, which implies he was self-conscious about their height difference. The author responded with a retort about his height, expecting a joke, but he took it seriously and left.\n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? Height is a physical attribute that can be an insecurity. The guy's question about the heels was a polite way to address his discomfort. The author's response was a direct jab at his height, which is a sensitive topic. Even if she thought it was a joke, it came off as rude. In social interactions, it's important to be mindful of others' insecurities. Making a comment about someone's height, especially in a delicate moment, can be hurtful. The guy's reaction suggests he felt insulted, which means the author's words had a negative impact. While the guy's initial comment about the heels was not great either, the author's response was more direct and likely the main reason the date failed. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
