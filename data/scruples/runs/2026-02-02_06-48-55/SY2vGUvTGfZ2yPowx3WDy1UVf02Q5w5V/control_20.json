From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a date where the guy comments on her heels, and she responds by calling him short. The date then ends badly.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The guy asked if she had to wear those heels, which could be seen as a comment on the height difference. The author replied with a joke about him being short, expecting a laugh but he took it the wrong way. \n\nHeight is a physical attribute someone can't control, so commenting on it might be sensitive. Even if the guy first brought up the heels, the author's response directly addressed his height. That could be hurtful, even if meant as a joke. People might find height comments offensive because they hit a personal insecurity. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's initial comment about the heels might have been the first jab. The author thought he was making a joke, but maybe he wasn't. If he was being rude, then the author's response might be a reaction to that. But even so, making a joke about someone's height could still be inappropriate. \n\nIn social interactions, it's important to avoid comments that could be seen as attacking someone's insecurities. Both sides have their points, but the author's response might have been the direct cause of the tension. Even if the guy was uncomfortable first, the author's retort could have been the final straw. So, maybe the author is in the wrong. \n\nBut wait, the guy initiated the comment. However, the author's response was a direct jab at his height. So even if provoked, making a joke about someone's height isn't ideal. The answer might lean towards AITA (Author Is The Antagonist) here. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
