From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author met a guy on a dating app and they went out to a bar. The guy was uncomfortable, and he made a comment about her wearing heels, which made her respond by calling him short. The date ended up bombing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy was already uncomfortable when they met. He asked if she had to wear those heels, which seems like a direct comment about their height difference. The author thought he was trying to make a joke or ease the tension, so she replied with a joke about his height. But he didn't take it as a joke and got upset. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. On one hand, height is a physical trait a person can't control, so commenting on it might be considered rude, especially if the other person is already insecure about it. The author acknowledges that she feels bad because she realized he was insecure about his height. But on the other hand, the guy's initial comment about the heels was kind of a jab too. So both parties might have made comments they thought were jokes but came off the wrong way.\n\nBut in social situations, even if someone else starts with a comment, responding with a counter-comment about their insecurities might escalate things. The author's response was a retort, but since the guy didn't find it funny and left, it's possible that the author's remark was the last straw. However, it's also possible that the guy was already uncomfortable and looking for an excuse to leave. \n\nThe key point here is whether the author's comment was the wrong action. Since the guy's height is not something he can change, making a joke about it, even if intended as a joke, could be seen as insensitive. The author might have overstepped by responding with a comment about his height, especially since he had already expressed discomfort. So even if the guy was rude first, the author's response could still be considered inconsiderate. But is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. Maybe both are at least partially responsible, but the question is specifically about the author. \n\nIn some cases, people might say that if someone brings up a sensitive topic, the other person's response is a valid reaction, but if it leads to hurt feelings, then the responder is at fault. Since the author admitted that the guy's height is not his fault and that she felt bad, it suggests she may have realized her mistake. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she made a comment about his insecurities, even if he started the conversation. But others might say that the guy was rude first, so she was just responding. However, usually, in these situations, the person who makes the personal comment is seen as the one in the wrong, even if provoked. So I think the answer is A.\n"
