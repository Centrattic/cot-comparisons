From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for calling their date \"short.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman went on a date with a guy she met on a dating app. When they met, the guy was uncomfortable, and later asked if she had to wear heels. She responded by saying he was short. The guy got sullen and the date ended badly.\n\nThe key points here are about respect and how each person handled the situation. The guy commented on her heels, which might have been a way to address the height difference. The woman then made a joke about his height. The guy took it seriously and left. \n\nNow, the question is whether she was wrong. In social interactions, even if someone makes a comment that's meant as a joke, if it's about a sensitive topic like height, which is a fixed trait, it can be seen as hurtful. The fact that the guy was already uncomfortable and she made a quip that could be interpreted as a jab might have crossed a line. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy initially made a comment about her heels, which could be seen as a bit rude himself. But when it comes to personal insecurities, teasing about something like height can be damaging. The woman might have thought she was being funny, but if the guy was already insecure about his height, her response would likely hurt his feelings. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered more respectful to avoid making comments about someone's physical attributes, especially if they're outside their control. So even if she thought it was a joke, the way it came out might have been the issue. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Considering that the guy was already uncomfortable and the response targeted his insecurity, the woman's comment was probably not appropriate. So the answer would be A, she's in the wrong. But wait, the other side is that he was the one who brought up the height issue first by mentioning the heels. But his comment could have been a joke as well. However, the woman's response was direct and focused on his height, which is a more direct jab. So even if he started it, her response wasn't considerate. \n\nTherefore, the consensus would likely be that the author was in the wrong because she made a comment that was hurtful about a sensitive topic.\n"
