From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a date where the guy mentioned her heels, and she replied by calling him short. The date didn't go well, and they split up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy asked her if she had to wear those heels, which might have been a comment on their height difference. He might have felt self-conscious about being shorter than her. The author's response was a retort about his height. She thought he was trying to make a joke, but he didn't laugh and left sulkily.\n\nNow, the key points are about intent and insensitivity. The guy bringing up the heels could be a way to address the height difference, maybe to express discomfort. The author's reply was direct and could be seen as a jab, even if she meant it as a joke. The problem here is that height is a physical trait someone can't change, and making a comment about it, even in jest, might not be appropriate, especially if it's a sensitive topic.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's initial comment about the heels could be interpreted as a bit rude. If he was uncomfortable, maybe he could have addressed it more gently. However, the author's response was a direct retort, which escalated the situation. She might not have realized how sensitive he was about his height. But even so, making a joke about someone's height in a first date is risky because it can come off as hurtful, especially if they're already feeling insecure.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to assess if her comment was the main issue. Since she was aware of her height and he brought up the heels, her response was a bit defensive. However, in social interactions, especially on a date, it's important to consider the other person's feelings. Even if her intention was to respond in kind, it might not have been the right approach. The guy might have felt that his insecurity was being mocked, leading to his sulkiness and leaving.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment about his height was likely the more hurtful action, even if she thought it was a joke. People often have insecurities they don't want to be addressed, and height is a common one. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
