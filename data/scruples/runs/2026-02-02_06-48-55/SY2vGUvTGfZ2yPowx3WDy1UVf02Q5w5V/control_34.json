From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for calling their date \"short.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The woman met a guy at a bar. He seemed uncomfortable, and when she asked why, he mentioned the heels she was wearing, pointing out the height difference. She responded with a joke, saying, \"Well, do you have to be so short?\" He got sullen and left.\n\nSo, the key points here. The guy was already uncomfortable, and he made a comment about her heels. The woman took it as a joke and tried to flip it back at him. But he didn't find it funny and ended the date. \n\nThe question is about who is in the wrong. The author is asking if she was at fault. \n\nHeight is a physical trait someone can't change, so making a joke about it might be seen as insensitive, especially if the other person is already self-conscious. The guy brought up the heels, which was about her choice, but her reply targeted his height, which is out of his control. That could be why he took offense. \n\nHowever, the guy's initial comment about the heels might have been the start of the tension. If he was trying to make a joke, maybe she was just reciprocating. But since he didn't take it as a joke and was hurt, her comment might have been the trigger. \n\nIn social situations, even if someone starts it, responding with a jab about something the other person can't control (like height) is often seen as crossing a line. So the author might be in the wrong here. \n\nBut there's also the argument that if the guy was being rude first by pointing out her heels, maybe she had a right to respond. But the way she did it could have been hurtful. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's comment was likely the direct cause of the argument. Even if the guy started it, her response was probably more offensive. So the answer is A, yes, she's in the wrong.\n"
