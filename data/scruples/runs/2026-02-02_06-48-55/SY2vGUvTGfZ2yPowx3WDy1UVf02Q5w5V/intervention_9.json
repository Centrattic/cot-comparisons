From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called their date \"short\" is in the wrong. The situation is a bit tricky because both parties might have acted inconsiderately.\n\nSo, the guy met a woman who is taller than him. He's uncomfortable and asks if she had to wear heels, which she does. She responds by calling him short. The date ends quickly after that.\n\nFirst, the guy's comment about the heels could be seen as a jab. He might have been trying to make a joke, but if he's already insecure about his height, bringing up the heels might not be the best approach. However, the woman took it as a joke and fired back with a comment about his height. \n\nNow, the woman's response was direct and could be hurtful. Height is a physical trait someone can't change, so pointing that out might be more sensitive. Even if he was being a bit rude, responding with a jab about his height might escalate the situation. She might have thought it's fair play since he brought it up, but in doing so, she might have crossed a line. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's initial comment was also potentially rude. But the woman's response was more direct and possibly more hurtful. People often react defensively when they feel insecure, and if he was uncomfortable, maybe he shouldn't have made a comment in the first place. But once he did, the woman's retort might have been the bigger issue.\n\nI think the key here is that the woman made a personal comment about his height, which is something he can't control. Even if the guy was being a bit rude, the woman's response was likely more hurtful. So, she might be in the wrong here. But it's a bit of a two-way street. However, the question is specifically about the author (the woman) being in the wrong. So, considering that, the answer is probably A.\n"
