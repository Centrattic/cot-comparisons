From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling their date \"short.\" The situation is that the guy mentioned the heels, which made him uncomfortable due to the height difference. The author responded with a jab about his height, expecting a joke, but it backfired.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy brought up the heels, which could be seen as a way to address his own discomfort. The author's response was a retort about his height. The key here is whether the author's comment was inappropriate.\n\nHeight is a personal trait that can't be changed, so commenting on it might hit a sensitive spot. The guy's initial comment about the heels might have been a bit rude, but the author's response was a direct jab. Even if the author thought it was a joke, using a personal trait like height can be a sensitive topic. The author's response might have been a bit harsh because it's not something the guy can control. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's question about the heels could be seen as bringing up the issue first. However, the author's retort took it a step further by making it a personal comment. The author might have overreacted by turning the conversation into a personal attack. \n\nIn social interactions, it's often better to avoid making jokes about things people can't change, like height, unless you know they're comfortable with it. Since the guy was already uncomfortable, the author's response likely made it worse. Even if the author thought it was a joke, the context suggests that the guy was already self-conscious, so the comment could have been hurtful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment about the guy's height was likely the wrong move. It's a sensitive topic, and the author didn't consider the guy's feelings. Therefore, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
