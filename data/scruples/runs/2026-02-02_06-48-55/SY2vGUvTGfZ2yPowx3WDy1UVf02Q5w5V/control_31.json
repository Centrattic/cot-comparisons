From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for calling their date \"short.\" The situation is that the guy was uncomfortable with the height difference because the woman was wearing heels, and he made a comment about it. She replied by joking about his height, expecting a laugh, but he took it seriously and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy mentioned the heels, which might have made him feel self-conscious about his height. He could be projecting his own insecurity. The woman's retort about his height was a joke, but he didn't find it funny. Now, the question is whether she was in the wrong for making that comment.\n\nIn relationships, teasing can be a sensitive topic. What's a joke for one person might be hurtful to another. Even if she thought it was a light-hearted response, using someone's height as a joke can touch on insecurities that they might not want to address. Also, he had already expressed his discomfort, so maybe she should have been more considerate in her response.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's initial comment about the heels could be seen as a bit rude. But the woman's response escalated the situation. She might not have intended to hurt him, but the comment was about something he can't change, which is his height. People often have insecurities about their height, so it's possible that her reply, even if meant as a joke, was offensive.\n\nSo, while both parties might have contributed to the tension\u2014his comment about the heels and her retort\u2014it's more likely that the woman's remark was the immediate cause of the conflict. She should have recognized his discomfort and perhaps responded in a way that was more understanding rather than making a joke about his height. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong here.\n"
