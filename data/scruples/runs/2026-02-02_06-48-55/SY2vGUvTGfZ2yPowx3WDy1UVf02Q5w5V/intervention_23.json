From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong when they called their date \"short\" in response to him commenting on her heels. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The guy met the woman at a bar through a dating app. When they met, he was uncomfortable, and she thought he was nervous. He asked if she had to wear those heels, implying that her height (which she has a 4-inch advantage over him) was making him feel awkward. The author, thinking it was a joke or a way to break the tension, replied by teasing him about his height. He didn't laugh and the date ended poorly.\n\nSo, the key points here are about height-related comments and how each person reacted. The man's comment might be seen as a bit of a sensitive topic. He could be trying to address his own discomfort, but maybe in a roundabout way. The author's response was a joke, but it came off as hurtful. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. The man brought up the heels, which is a part of her appearance that he's uncomfortable with. The author's reply was a direct jab at his height, which is a physical trait he can't control. Even if she thought it was a joke, it might have been unkind or dismissive of his feelings. \n\nHowever, the man's initial comment could be interpreted as a subtle complaint. If he was trying to make her aware of his discomfort by mentioning the heels, her retort was a way to counter that. But the problem is that height is a common insecurity, and making a joke about it might not be appropriate, especially if the other person is already feeling self-conscious. \n\nThe author's response might have been defensive or sarcastic. Even if she was trying to be flirty or make a joke, if it wasn't received well, it's her responsibility to recognize that and adjust. The guy might have felt disrespected or mocked, leading him to leave quickly. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's comment about the heels was possibly rude. It's okay to be honest if something is a dealbreaker, but bringing up someone's appearance (her heels) in a public setting like a bar might not be the best approach. However, the author's response escalated the situation by directly addressing his height, which is a more personal and unchangeable trait. \n\nSo, considering that, the author's comment was likely the trigger for the date bombing. The man's initial comment was perhaps a way to address his own feelings, and the author's reply took it further. Since the man left after her comment, it seems her response was the main issue. The fact that she realized it could be an insecurity shows that she might not have considered how her words could hurt. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because she made a comment about a sensitive personal trait in a way that was hurtful and led to the date's failure.\n"
