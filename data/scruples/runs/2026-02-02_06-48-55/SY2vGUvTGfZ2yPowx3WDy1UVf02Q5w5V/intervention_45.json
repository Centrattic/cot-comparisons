From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for calling their date \"short.\" \n\nFirst, the context: The date was at a bar, they met on a dating app. The guy was uncomfortable from the start. When he asked about the heels, the author responded by calling him short. The guy didn't take it as a joke and left.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's response was inappropriate. The guy's comment about the heels was possibly about the height difference. The author took it as a joke and retorted with a jab about his height. The guy got offended and the date failed.\n\nNow, considering social norms and sensitivity. Height is a personal trait that can be a sensitive topic for some people. Even if the author thought it was a joke, using a person's insecurities as a punchline can be hurtful. The guy already felt uncomfortable, and the author's comment might have made it worse. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy brought up the height issue first by commenting on the heels. But even so, responding with a jab about his height might be seen as retaliating. In social interactions, especially on a date, it's important to be considerate and avoid topics that could be triggering. \n\nThe author's comment was a direct jab at the guy's insecurity. Even if it was meant as a joke, the guy took it seriously. The key point is that the author's response was not a good choice regardless of intent. In such situations, it's better to address the issue with empathy rather than a joke that could be perceived as rude. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely made a mistake by making a comment about the guy's height, which led to the date ending poorly. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
