From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling her date \"short.\" The situation involves a date where the guy is uncomfortable because the woman is taller, and she responds with a joke about his height. The guy gets sullen and leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and sensitivity around body comments. Generally, people tend to find height comments more acceptable than other body-related jabs, but it's still a sensitive topic for some. The guy initially made a comment about her heels, which she took as a joke and responded with a joke about his height. However, he didn't find it funny and left.\n\nThe key points here are: the guy was already uncomfortable, she made a joke about his height in response to his comment about her heels. She thought it was a joke, but he took it as an insult. Her heels were a choice, while his height is not. So she might have overstepped, even if she was just trying to be playful. But the guy's initial comment could also be seen as starting the dynamic. \n\nThe question is who is in the wrong. If she responded in kind, but height is a more personal and fixed trait, her comment might be more hurtful. Even if he initiated by commenting on her heels, responding with a joke about his insecurities might not be the best approach. People have different sensitivities, and she may not have known he was insecure about his height. However, making a comment about someone's height can be seen as rude, especially if it's in response to their own comment about something they can control (heels vs. height). \n\nOn the other hand, the guy could have handled it better too. If he was uncomfortable with the height difference, maybe he could have communicated it more sensitively. But he did make a comment about the heels, which she responded to. So both might have contributed, but the question is specifically about the author. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author made a joke that was hurtful to the guy, even if it was in response. The guy had the right to feel uncomfortable, and the author's response might have been a bit cruel. So the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong). But maybe it's a shared responsibility. However, since the question is whether AITA, the community might see her as at fault because she made a personal comment about his height, which is a sensitive topic. So I think the answer is A.\n"
