From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling their date \"short.\" The situation is that the guy was uncomfortable because of the height difference. He asked if she had to wear those heels, which the author took as a joke. Then she retorted with \"do you have to be so short?\" He got sulky and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy's comment about the heels was a bit awkward. Maybe he was trying to make a point about the height difference. The author's response was a direct jab at his height. Now, height can be a sensitive topic for some people. While the guy's initial comment might have been a bit rude, the author's response was a direct personal attack on his insecurities. \n\nBut, the author mentions that the guy isn't short, just that she has 4 inches on him. So maybe he's not extremely short, but still, people can be sensitive about it. The author's retort was a bit sharp. Even if she thought he was joking, responding with a jab might have been inappropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy's initial question could be seen as bringing up the issue, so maybe the author's reaction was a response to his comment. However, using a comment about his height might have been the wrong approach. It's possible that he was trying to address the height difference in a lighthearted way, but the author took it the wrong way. \n\nThe key here is social norms in dating. People often avoid sensitive topics unless both parties are comfortable. If the guy was uncomfortable with the height difference, bringing it up might have been awkward. But the author's response was a direct jab, which can be seen as unkind. Even if the guy's comment was a bit rude, the author's response might have escalated the situation. \n\nSo, while the guy's initial comment may have been a bit unkind, the author's response was a direct attack on his insecurities, which is generally considered more offensive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for making the comment about his height.\n"
