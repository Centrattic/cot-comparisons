From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling their date \"short\" after he commented on her heels making her taller. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The guy they met on a dating app was uncomfortable when he saw her, which they initially thought was nervousness. Then he asked if she had to wear those heels, implying he's uncomfortable with the height difference. The author took it as a joke and quipped back, \"Do you have to be so short?\" expecting a laugh. But he got upset and left.\n\nSo, the key points here are the height difference and the comments made. The author is 4 inches taller because of heels, and the guy is not short, but the author's comment was about his height. The author is now wondering if they were in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider social norms and sensitivity here. Making a joke about someone's height can be a sensitive topic. Even if the author thought it was a lighthearted response, the guy took it as an insult. Height is a fixed trait, so commenting on it might be seen as unkind, especially if it's something the person is self-conscious about. The author's intention was probably to respond in kind with humor, but if the other person didn't find it funny and was actually insecure about their height, the author's comment could have crossed a line.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy did make a comment about her heels, which might have been a joke or a sincere complaint. But he might have been trying to address his own discomfort. The author's response was a direct retort about his height. In social interactions, sometimes people make jokes to defuse situations, but if the joke is taken the wrong way, it can lead to conflict. However, it's also possible that the guy was being a bit rude by bringing up the heels in the first place. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author's response was inconsiderate. The author admits that the guy's height is not something he can control, so pointing it out might be hurtful. Even if the author thought it was a joke, if the other person was sensitive about their height, the comment could be seen as dismissive or mocking. \n\nI think the author's comment was a bit on the edge. While it's understandable to respond in kind, especially if both parties were trying to make light of the situation, the impact of the comment matters. Since the guy got upset and left, it suggests that the author's words were hurtful. In such cases, even if the intention was to joke, the result is that the other person felt disrespected. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the guy's possible insecurity about his height and making a joke that led to the date ending poorly. So the answer would be A for Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
