From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong after calling their date \"short.\" The situation is that the guy mentioned the heels, and she replied by calling him short.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The guy was uncomfortable with the height difference, so he made a comment about the heels. The woman thought it was a joke but responded with a jab about his height. He didn't laugh, got sulky, and left.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The guy's comment about the heels could be seen as a bit rude, but maybe he was trying to address his own insecurity. The woman's response was a retort that directly addressed his insecurities. But height is something not controllable, so criticizing that could be more hurtful than commenting on fashion choices.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman might have felt defensive. If the guy was being sarcastic, she might have felt she had to respond. But the key here is whether her response was appropriate. Using sarcasm to call someone out on their insecurities can come off as mean, even if it's meant as a joke.\n\nAlso, the outcome was that the date ended poorly. The woman is conflicted but thinks she's in the wrong. The user also thinks the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn social interactions, it's important to be considerate of others' insecurities. While the guy's comment might not be perfect, the woman's response likely escalated the situation. So the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
