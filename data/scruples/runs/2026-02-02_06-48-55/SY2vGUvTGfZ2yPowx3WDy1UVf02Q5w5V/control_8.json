From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves a date where the guy comments on her heels making him uncomfortable because of the height difference. She responds by calling him short, expecting a joke, but he gets upset and leaves.\n\nFirst, the guy's comment about the heels could be seen as a way to address the height difference. He might be uncomfortable because he's shorter, and the heels added to that. The author's response was a retort about his height. Now, whether she was wrong depends on intent and how her words affected him.\n\nHe was already uncomfortable, and her response was a direct jab at his insecurity. Even if she thought it was a joke, using a trait he can't control (height) as a retort might be insensitive. People can have different reactions to humor, and in this context, it might have come off as unkind. On the other hand, the guy's initial comment about the heels was also a bit direct and possibly rude, since he's bringing up the height difference in a way that's not subtle.\n\nBut the key point here is that the author's response targeted his insecurities. Even if she wasn't malicious, making a comment about someone's height in a sensitive situation can be hurtful. The guy's reaction might be valid because he felt targeted. The author might have overstepped by not considering how her words would land. So, while both parties might have had moments of insensitivity, the author's retort directly addressed a sensitive issue, which could be seen as her being in the wrong.\n"
