From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a date where the guy comments on her heels because she's taller than him, and she replies by calling him short. The date went poorly after that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around this. Complimenting someone's height isn't a common thing, especially if it's a sensitive topic. The guy asked if she had to wear heels, which could be seen as a comment on her height. The author responded by saying he's short, which might have been a joke, but he took it seriously and got upset.\n\nHeight can be a sensitive issue for some people. While it's true that the author is tall, making a direct comment about someone's height, even in jest, can be hurtful. The key here is whether the author's response was appropriate. She thought it was a joke, but he didn't find it funny and got sullen. That suggests that her comment crossed a line, even if she was trying to be playful.\n\nAlso, the guy's initial comment about the heels was a way to address the height difference, maybe to express discomfort. The author's response was a retort, which escalated the situation. Even if the guy's comment was a bit rude, responding with a jab about his height might not be the best approach. It's possible that both parties could have handled the situation better, but the author's response directly targeted his insecurity, which is generally considered inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel she was just matching his tone, but humor that's based on personal insecurities can easily backfire. The main point is that making a joke about someone's height, especially when they're already uncomfortable about it, is likely to be seen as insensitive. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
