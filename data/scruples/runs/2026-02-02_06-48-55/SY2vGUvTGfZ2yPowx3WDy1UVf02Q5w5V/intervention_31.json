From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The situation is about a date where the man comments on her heels, and she retorts by calling him short, leading to the date ending badly.\n\nFirst, the man was clearly uncomfortable with the height difference. He asked if she had to wear those heels, which might be a way to address the issue. The author took it as a joke and replied by pointing out his height, which the man took as a jab. Now, height is a physical trait that can't be changed, so commenting on it might be considered more sensitive than her choice to wear heels. \n\nIf the man was trying to address his own discomfort by bringing up the heels, the author's response of calling him short could have been a bit harsh. Even if she thought he was joking, responding with a direct jab at his height might have been too direct. In social situations, being aware of others' insecurities is important. Since height is a common insecurity, the author might have overstepped by making a comment about it. \n\nOn the other hand, the man's initial comment could be seen as rude too. But the question is about the author's actions. She might have intended a joke, but it backfired. It's possible that the man's discomfort was valid, and her response wasn't considerate of that. So, while both might have handled the situation better, the author's direct jab at his height is more likely to be the direct cause of the date going south. Hence, she might be in the wrong.\n"
