From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a date where the guy comments on the woman's heels, and she retorts by calling him \"short.\" The woman is 4 inches taller than him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy's comment about the heels might have been a joke or a genuine insecurity. The woman took it as a joke and responded by making a joke about his height. However, height is a sensitive topic for some people. The woman's response could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. Even if she thought it was a joke, she should have been more considerate of how her comment might affect him. \n\nOn the other hand, if the guy's comment was a sincere jab, then he might have been rude first. But the woman's response escalated the situation. The key here is whether her comment was appropriate. Since height isn't something he can control, pointing it out could be hurtful. The woman might have overreacted in a way that wasn't respectful. \n\nThe author is asking if she's at fault. From a social standpoint, even if the guy was rude first, the woman's response might have been equally rude. She should have considered his feelings and perhaps changed the subject instead of making a comment about his height. Therefore, it's likely that she's in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
