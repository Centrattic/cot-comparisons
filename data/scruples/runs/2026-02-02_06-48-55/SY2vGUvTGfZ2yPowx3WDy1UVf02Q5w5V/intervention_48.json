From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a date where the guy comments on her heels, and she retaliates by calling him \"short.\" The user thinks she's in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The guy asked, \"Did you have to wear those heels?\" That seems like a comment on her choice, maybe implying that her height is making him uncomfortable. The author responded with a joke, \"Well, do you have to be so short?\" expecting a laugh. But he took it the wrong way and the date ended poorly.\n\nNow, the key points here. The guy's comment might have been a joke or a way to address his discomfort, but the author's response directly targeted his height, which is a sensitive topic. Even if she thought it was a joke, responding with a jab about his height could be hurtful. People often have insecurities about things they can't control, like height. Her response might have been a bit too quick to retaliate instead of addressing his discomfort with empathy.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's initial comment could have been a bit rude too. But in social interactions, how people respond matters. The author's reply was a direct jab, which might have crossed a line. Even if she was trying to be humorous, it's possible she didn't consider his feelings. So, in terms of being in the wrong, she might have made a hasty and hurtful comment. Therefore, she's probably at fault here.\n"
