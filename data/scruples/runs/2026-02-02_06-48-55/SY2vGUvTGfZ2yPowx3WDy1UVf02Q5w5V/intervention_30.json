From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for calling their date \"short.\" The situation involves a height difference and a bit of back-and-forth between the two people.\n\nFirst, the guy was uncomfortable when they first met. He later asked if she had to wear those heels, which made the woman realize he was thinking about the height difference. She responded with a joke about his height, expecting him to laugh, but he got sullen and left. The woman is conflicted because she feels bad for hurting his feelings but also thinks he was rude for bringing up her heels.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether her retort was appropriate. Height is a physical attribute someone can't change, and making a joke about it might be seen as insensitive, especially if the person is already insecure about it. The guy's comment about the heels could be a light-hearted joke or a genuine concern, but the woman's response was a direct jab at his insecurities. Even if she thought it was a joke, pointing out his height in reply might have been too harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy did bring up the heels, which could be seen as his own way of trying to address the issue. But using a joke to address a personal insecurity might not be the best approach either. However, the woman's response escalated the situation. Insensitivity about something one can't control, like height, is often viewed as more offensive than a joke about a choice, like wearing heels. \n\nTherefore, while both might have said things that weren't ideal, the woman's comment directly targeted an insecurities in a way that's harder for the guy to control, making her more in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
