From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault here. The situation is that she went on a date with a guy, and during the date, he commented on her wearing heels, which made him uncomfortable because she was taller than him. She responded by calling him \"short,\" which wasn't well-received, and the date ended badly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy was already uncomfortable, and she tried to respond with a joke. But he didn't find it funny and got upset. The key points here are about humor vs. being hurtful. The woman thought he was making a joke about her heels, so she retorted with a joke about his height. However, the guy's comment might not have been a joke. He mentioned his discomfort with the height difference, possibly indicating an insecurity. Her response was a direct jab at his insecurity, which he took as offensive rather than a joke.\n\nIn relationships or dates, it's important to consider the other person's feelings. While the guy's comment about the heels was a bit abrupt, the woman's response was a direct and personal jab. Even if she thought it was a joke, making a comment about someone's height\u2014something they can't control\u2014can be hurtful. It's possible he was trying to address his own discomfort, and her response escalated the situation instead of defusing it. \n\nOn the other hand, if his comment was intended as a joke, then her response might have been a fair play. But the narrative suggests that he was uncomfortable and wasn't trying to be funny. So her retort was likely unkind and dismissive of his feelings. People can have insecurities, and even if they're not visible, making a joke about them can be inappropriate. \n\nThe woman's intention was to respond in kind with humor, but she misread his comment. Whether it was a joke or not, her response was a direct attack on his insecurities, which is generally considered rude. So, in this case, she might be at fault for not considering his feelings and responding in a way that was hurtful. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the guy was also at fault for making a comment about her heels, which she didn't control either. But height is a more permanent trait, so the impact of a joke about someone's height can be more hurtful. The key here is the intention behind the comments. If the guy was trying to be honest about his discomfort, then the response should be empathetic. The woman's response, while maybe intended as a joke, didn't show empathy and instead mocked his insecurity. \n\nSo, considering all that, the woman was in the wrong because she made a comment about something the guy is insecure about, even if it was a joke. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
