From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a date where the guy made a comment about her heels, and she responded by calling him short. The date went badly after that.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The guy met her at a bar through a dating app. From the start, he seemed uncomfortable. When they met, he asked if she had to wear those heels. She took it as a joke trying to break the tension. Her response was, \"Do you have to be so short?\" He didn't laugh, got sulkier, and left. Now she's wondering if she was in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether her response was appropriate. Let me break this down. The guy's comment about her heels was about the height difference. She took it as a joke and quipped back about his height. He didn't find it funny and left. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, height is a physical trait that can be a sensitive topic. Even if he made the first comment, her retort might have been a bit harsh. She might have misread his intention. He might have been trying to make a joke, but maybe it was more about his own insecurity. Her response could have been a knee-jerk reaction, but it's possible that bringing up his height, especially if it's a sensitive issue for him, could have escalated the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, he did initiate the conversation about the heels. Maybe he was trying to bring up the height difference to address his discomfort. If her heels were making a big height difference, perhaps he felt self-conscious. But his approach was to comment on her choice of footwear, which she took as a joke. However, her response was a direct jab at his height. \n\nSo, even if he made the first comment, her reply might have been too direct and hurtful. People often have insecurities, and even if the topic is brought up, a sarcastic or direct comment can be unkind. It's possible she overstepped, even if he started the conversation. \n\nBut wait, maybe he was being rude first. He asked if she had to wear the heels, which could be seen as a complaint. Her response was a retort. But even so, in a date, it's about mutual respect. If she responded with a jab, even if he started it, maybe she was in the wrong because she took it further. \n\nAlso, considering the outcome: he left quickly, and the date bombed. The author now feels bad because she realizes his height is not his choice. So there's a chance she realizes she was insensitive. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the community often looks at intent and impact. Even if her intent was to joke, the impact was negative. So she might be the one in the wrong. \n\nSo my answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she responded with a direct jab about his height, which is a sensitive topic, even if he brought up the heels. Her response likely hurt his feelings and ended the date, so she bears some responsibility.\n"
