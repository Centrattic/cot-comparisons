From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a date where the guy comments on her heels making a height difference, and she retorts by calling him short. The date ends badly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy seems uncomfortable and points out her heels, which makes the height difference. The woman interprets this as a joke and responds with a jab about his height. But the guy doesn't laugh and leaves.\n\nIn terms of social norms, making a comment about someone's physical attribute, especially one they might be insecure about, can be hurtful. Even if the woman thought he was joking, responding with a direct jab about his height could be seen as crossing a line. Height is a personal trait someone can't change, so commenting on it might be more offensive than her choice of heels, which is a fashion decision she can control.\n\nHowever, the guy did start the conversation by bringing up the heels, which could be seen as a bit rude too. But the key here is how each party handled the situation. The woman's response was a direct and potentially hurtful retort. Even if he was being playful, her reply might have been the immediate cause of his sulk and the date's demise. \n\nThe woman later feels bad, realizing that his height is an insecurity. That self-awareness is important. But the initial reaction of making a joke about his height, especially in a sensitive context like a first date, could be considered inconsiderate. So, while both might have contributed, the question is who is more at fault. The woman's comment directly addressed an insecurity, leading to the negative outcome. Therefore, she might be in the wrong.\n"
