From the moment he sees me, I can tell he's uncomfortable, and I'm honestly not sure why. I figure maybe he's nervous. I try my best to put him at ease, but he's just not feeling it. Finally he says, \"Did you *have* to wear those heels, though?\" \n\nOK, so now I get it: he's been thinking about the height differential. He's not a short guy, but at present I've got about 4 inches on him. I honestly thought he was trying to break some tension with a joke (and also clueing me in on why he was feeling uncomfortable)... so I responded, \"Well, do you have to be so *short*?\" I fully expected him to laugh - but he did not. He got very sulky, and very quickly the date bombed and he left. I doubt we'll ever meet up again. \n\nOn the one hand, I feel terrible for what I said. Obviously it's something he's insecure about, and, unlike my fashion choices, his height is not something he has control over. On the other hand, I'm pretty aware of how tall I am, and if his calling me out on the heels was a sincere jab, then I feel he was being kind of rude too. So I'm just puzzling out who was in the wrong for what went down, and could use a little help. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling their date \"short.\" Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author went on a date with a guy they met on a dating app. The guy seemed uncomfortable, and after wearing heels, the author ended up being about 4 inches taller than him. The guy asked if she had to wear those heels, which the author interpreted as a joke to break the tension. The author then replied, \"Well, do you have to be so short?\" The guy didn't laugh, got sullen, and the date ended poorly.\n\nNow, the user wants to know if the author is at fault here. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nLet me consider the key points. The guy's comment about the heels could be seen as a light-hearted way to address the height difference, maybe even a joke. The author's response was a direct retort about his height. The problem here is that the guy might have been trying to make a joke, but the author's response was a jab at his insecurity. Height is a sensitive topic for some people, and even if it's not meant to be offensive, pointing out someone's height in a confrontational way can be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the guy's initial comment was a bit rude, as asking if she had to wear heels could be perceived as a jab. However, the author's response escalated the situation. Instead of addressing the discomfort in a more constructive way, like acknowledging the height difference, the author made a direct comment on his height, which might have been the trigger for the guy to leave.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they are aware of their own height and that the guy's reaction might be about his own insecurities. So, even if the guy's initial comment was a joke, the author's response might have been a bit too sharp. The key is whether the author's retort was in poor taste. Since height is a personal characteristic that can't be changed, making a comment about it, even in jest, can be seen as insensitive, especially if the other person is already uncomfortable. \n\nThe guy's reaction (getting sullen and leaving) suggests that the author's response was not well-received. While the guy might have been overreacting, the author's comment was likely the catalyst. Therefore, the author probably did have some part in the situation by responding in a way that could be hurtful, even if they thought it was a joke.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because making a comment about someone's height, even in a joking manner, when they've already expressed discomfort about a height-related issue, can be seen as insensitive. The author's response likely hurt the guy's feelings, especially if height is a sensitive topic for him, and that led to the date going south.\n"
