      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a date where the guy picked up the girl because she doesn't drive, they went to a restaurant, and then after the date, when he asks when they can go out again, she says she's not looking for a relationship. He then tells her to get an Uber and leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The guy arranged the date, picked her up, paid for the meal, and then after being rejected, he tells her to take an Uber home. The key points here are about how he handled the rejection. \n\nThe girl said she's not looking to date, which is a clear response. The guy's reaction was to leave her with an Uber suggestion. Now, the question is whether that's wrong. \n\nFrom a social perspective, when someone is rejected, it's important to handle it gracefully. The guy might have been hurt, but telling her to get an Uber could come off as abrupt or insensitive. However, he was also the one who picked her up, so maybe he felt responsible for getting her home. But she's not his responsibility anymore once the date is over, especially if they don't have a relationship.\n\nBut then again, leaving her without offering an alternative might be seen as cold. However, since she's using Uber and doesn't drive, he might have been the only one who could take her home. If he just left, that could be problematic. \n\nWait, but the user says the guy told her to get an Uber and left. So he's not taking her, but suggesting a ride. Is that wrong? Maybe. If she doesn't drive, maybe she's in an area where Uber isn't available or she can't afford it. But he's not obligated to take her home after being rejected. \n\nThe girl's response of \"just likes meeting new people\" is a bit flimsy. People do go on dates to meet people, but if she's not interested in a relationship, it's honest. The guy's reaction was to leave abruptly, which could be seen as inconsiderate. But is that in the wrong? \n\nIn terms of social norms, after a first date, if someone is rejected, it's customary to end the interaction politely. The guy might be upset, but telling her to get an Uber instead of offering to take her home could be seen as a stingy or hurtful move. However, if he left because he was hurt and didn't want to prolong the date, that's understandable. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the man's actions were inconsiderate. Since he had picked her up, maybe she expected him to take her home. But she's using Uber, so maybe she's used to that. But if he was the one who initiated the pickup, perhaps she thought he would handle the drop-off as well. \n\nIn some cases, people might feel that after a date, even if it's over, you take the person home. But if the person doesn't drive, maybe the understanding was that the other person would. But if she's not interested, maybe he didn't want to. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. On one hand, he was hurt and left. On the other, he could have been more considerate by at least offering a ride. However, since she's using Uber, maybe he's not obligated. \n\nBut in social terms, when you pick someone up, you usually take them home unless they specify otherwise. If he left her to Uber alone, maybe that's a problem. But if she's comfortable with Uber, then it's not. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether his action of leaving her to Uber was inconsiderate. If he had just left abruptly without any alternative, that's inconsiderate. But he suggested Uber, which she can use. So maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nWait, but if she had to Uber alone, maybe it's not safe for her. But the post says she doesn't drive, so maybe she's used to Uber. So it's possible she's okay. \n\nIn conclusion, the guy's action might be seen as a bit cold, but since he suggested Uber, he's giving her an option. However, if he had offered to take her home, that would be more considerate. But since he didn't, is that wrong? \n\nI think the answer would be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't handle the rejection gracefully and left her without ensuring she gets home safely. But if she's using Uber, maybe he's not. Hmm.\n"
