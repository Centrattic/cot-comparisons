      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that they went on a date with a girl they picked up because she doesn't drive. The date went well, but when the guy asked her out again, she said she wasn't looking to date. He then told her to get an Uber and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy picked her up, paid for the meal, and the date was going well until she ended it. When she said she wasn't interested in dating, he asked why she came on the date in the first place. She responded by saying she likes meeting new people. Then he told her to get an Uber and left.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the guy was in the wrong. Let's break it down. Did he have the right to be upset? If she said she's not looking for a relationship, then the guy might feel the date was a waste of time. But she did say she likes meeting new people, which could imply she's open to social interactions without a serious commitment. However, when he asked her out again, she declined. So maybe he felt that she led him on, which is why he reacted by ending the date abruptly.\n\nBut was it wrong for him to tell her to take an Uber and leave? Well, if she's not interested in dating, maybe he felt disrespected or that she was using him for social interaction. However, ending the date like that might come off as abrupt or rude, even if he's upset. It's possible that instead of being angry and leaving her hanging, he could have ended the date more politely, regardless of her intentions.\n\nBut wait, he did pick her up and paid for the meal. If she was only there to meet new people and not to form a relationship, maybe he felt taken advantage of. However, the problem is that he's the one who initiated the date, so he might have known from the start that she was looking for casual interactions. If that's the case, then his reaction could be seen as him misreading her intentions. On the other hand, if she didn't clarify that upfront, maybe he's not entirely wrong to be confused.\n\nAnother angle: when she said she's not looking to date, he asked why she came on the date. That's a valid question. She said she likes meeting new people, which is a common reason people go on casual dates. So maybe he's overreacting by being upset and leaving her to get an Uber. Was he rude? Maybe. But if she wasn't interested, then he might have been within his right to end the date, though the way he did it might be problematic.\n\nIn terms of social norms, telling someone to take an Uber after a date where they didn't want to continue could be seen as abrupt. Even if he's hurt or angry, the appropriate response would be to politely end the date rather than leaving them stranded. So perhaps the author is in the wrong for reacting that way, even if he felt misled.\n\nAlternatively, if he felt that she was deceptive in agreeing to a date knowing she wasn't interested, maybe he's not entirely at fault. But the key issue here is his reaction. Telling her to take an Uber instead of offering to drive her home might be seen as callous, especially since he picked her up initially. If he didn't want to continue the date, he should have arranged for her to get home safely, regardless of his feelings.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because he didn't handle the situation politely, even if he felt hurt. However, some might argue that he's not at fault because she led him on. But the act of telling her to get an Uber and leaving immediately is what's being questioned here. That action is more about his response than her initial actions. Therefore, the person who wrote the question (the author) is likely in the wrong for his reaction.\n"
