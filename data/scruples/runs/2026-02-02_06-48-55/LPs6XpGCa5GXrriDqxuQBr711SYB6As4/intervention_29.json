She doesn\u2019t drive so I picked her up and we went out to a restaurant.  It was going well and I was enjoying getting to know her.  At the end I paid the check and asked her when we could go out again.  She told me she wasn\u2019t looking to date anyone right now.  I asked  her why did she come on a date with me then and she said that she just likes meeting new people.  I told her that she could catch an Uber home and left. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The author set up a date with a girl who doesn't drive, so he picked her up. They went to a restaurant, had a good time, and he paid. Then, he asked her when they could go out again, and she said she's not looking to date anyone. When he asked why she came on the date, she mentioned she likes meeting new people. The author then told her to get an Uber and left.\n\nFirst, the author did offer a ride because she doesn't drive. But after she declined the relationship, he didn't drop her off. Instead, he told her to take an Uber and left. That seems abrupt. Even if the date didn't go the way he wanted, he had already picked her up, so she was depending on him for transportation. Ending the date by leaving her without a ride could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, maybe he was upset because she didn't want to date him, so he acted out of frustration. But regardless of his feelings, she was relying on him for a ride home. So, by not providing the ride or helping her find an alternative (like splitting the Uber cost), he might have been inconsiderate. \n\nOn the other hand, she might have known she needed to arrange transport. But since he was the one who picked her up, it's implied that he would take her home. So, leaving her stranded after the date is over isn't ideal. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't follow through with the expected responsibility of getting her home safely after she couldn't drive. Even if the date ended poorly, he should have ensured she had a ride.\n"
