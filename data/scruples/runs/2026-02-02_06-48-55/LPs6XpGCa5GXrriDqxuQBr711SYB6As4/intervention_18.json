      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a date where the guy picked up the girl because she doesn't drive, then after the date, she said she wasn't looking to date anyone. He asked why she came on the date, and she said she just likes meeting new people. Then he told her to get an Uber home and left.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author arranged to pick her up because she doesn't drive, which was considerate. The date itself was going well, and he paid the check, which is a common courtesy. The problem arises when she ends the date by saying she's not looking for a relationship. He then asks her why she came on the date if that's the case, and she explains she's just meeting new people. In response, he tells her to take an Uber and leaves.\n\nSo, the user is asking if it's the author's fault (AITA) for telling her to get an Uber. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. \n\nI should consider social norms around dating. When you go on a date, it's normal to have expectations, but if the other person isn't looking for a relationship, it's their right to say so. The author's reaction is to leave her to take an Uber instead of driving her home. Was that inconsiderate? Well, the author had already picked her up, so he was under no obligation to drive her home again. However, leaving her in that situation might be seen as abrupt, especially since he had arranged to pick her up in the first place. \n\nBut, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The girl had rejected his advances, so maybe the author felt slighted. However, the appropriate response would be to either drive her home anyway despite the rejection or to find another way to help her get home. Telling her to take an Uber when he had the means to drive her might be seen as cutting her off, which could be unkind. \n\nOn the other hand, the author was within his rights to leave. The girl wasn't looking for a date, so maybe the author overstepped in expecting her to follow up. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not being accommodating after the rejection. \n\nI think the key here is the author's responsibility. Since he was the one who picked her up, people might expect him to drive her home as part of the date. Telling her to take an Uber after she's already been on the date could be seen as leaving her in a difficult spot because she can't drive. So the author might be in the wrong for not helping her get home after the date ended on a rejection. \n\nBut wait, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. I should check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The author left after paying for the Uber, but maybe he should have offered to stay until she got home. However, the user just says he told her to get an Uber and left. It's possible that the author didn't want to continue the conversation after the rejection, which is understandable, but the action of making her take an Uber after offering to pick her up might be seen as cold or inconsiderate. \n\nIn many dating scenarios, even if the date doesn't go as planned (like being rejected), it's polite to ensure the other person gets home safely. So the author's decision to leave her to take an Uber might be considered rude, but is he in the wrong? The girl did say she wasn't looking for a date, so maybe the author felt justified in ending the interaction. However, the act of not offering to drive her home despite knowing she can't drive could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he should have been more considerate in ensuring her safety after the date, regardless of the rejection.\n"
