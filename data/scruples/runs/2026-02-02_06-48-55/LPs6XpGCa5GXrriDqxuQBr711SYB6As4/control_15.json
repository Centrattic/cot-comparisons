      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully. \n\nThe user set up a date on OkCupid, picked up the girl since she doesn't drive, they went to a restaurant, and the date was going well. After paying the check, he asked her out again, but she said she's not looking to date. When he asked why she came on the date, she said she likes meeting new people. Then he told her to get an Uber home and left.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the girl didn't drive, so he picked her up. That's thoughtful. But when she declined the possibility of a relationship, he ended the date by telling her to take an Uber. Did he have to drive her home? Well, he didn't, but since he picked her up, maybe he should have offered a ride back. However, he might have felt hurt or disappointed when she said she wasn't interested in dating. So, he might have left abruptly because of that.\n\nIs there a social expectation that if you pick someone up, you should drive them home? In some cases, yes. If you're in a car, it's common to drop them off after the date. But if the person can't take the Uber themselves, then you might need to. But in this case, she didn't drive, and she was on a date with him. So, she might not have a car, and the Uber option might not be feasible for her if she doesn't have a car or a phone to call an Uber. Wait, the story says she doesn't drive, but maybe she has access to a phone to call Uber. Or maybe she relies on others for rides. But he told her to get an Uber, implying that he wasn't going to drive her home.\n\nSo, the problem here is that after she rejected his offer for a second date, he left her to take an Uber. But if she can't drive and doesn't have access to Uber, he might be leaving her without a way home. However, the story says she's on OkCupid, so maybe she has a phone and can use Uber. But even so, it's considered polite to drive someone home if you picked them up. If you end the date on bad terms, walking away might be seen as rude or inconsiderate.\n\nBut then, if she said she's not interested in dating, maybe he felt justified in ending the date quickly. However, even if the date went bad, the person he's with might be left without transportation. So, is it his responsibility to drive her home regardless of the date's outcome? In many social norms, yes. If you make the effort to pick someone up, you should make sure they get home safely. If he left her to take an Uber, and she can't, that's inconsiderate. But if she can take an Uber, maybe it's her responsibility. However, sometimes people rely on others for rides, and Uber might not be available or affordable.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the author was inconsiderate by not offering a ride home. Even if the date didn't go as he hoped, being polite and ensuring her safety is important. So, if he left her to take an Uber, maybe he's in the wrong because he didn't follow through on the responsibility he took on by picking her up. Alternatively, if he was hurt and left in a huff, maybe that's understandable, but it's still his responsibility to ensure she gets home safely.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the community often considers whether someone acted inconsiderately or violated social norms. If the person left her without arranging a ride home, that's a problem. So the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because he didn't ensure she got home safely after she wasn't interested in continuing the date. However, if she had the means to take an Uber, maybe it's not his fault. But since she doesn't drive, maybe she relies on others, and Uber might not be an option. The story says she doesn't drive, but it's possible she can use public transport or a ride-share app. However, if the author picked her up, he might be expected to drive her home regardless of the date's outcome. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not doing that.\n"
