She doesn\u2019t drive so I picked her up and we went out to a restaurant.  It was going well and I was enjoying getting to know her.  At the end I paid the check and asked her when we could go out again.  She told me she wasn\u2019t looking to date anyone right now.  I asked  her why did she come on a date with me then and she said that she just likes meeting new people.  I told her that she could catch an Uber home and left. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling a date to get an Uber after she said she's not looking to date. \n\nFirst, the situation: They met on OkCupid, he picked her up since she doesn't drive. The date went well, he paid, and then when he asked when they could go out again, she said she's not looking to date. He asked why she came on the date, she said she likes meeting new people. Then he told her to get an Uber and left.\n\nSo, the key points here. Did he do something wrong? Well, when she said she's not looking to date, that's a clear signal. He asked why she came on the date, and she explained. He might have felt misled, but maybe she was honest from the start. He offered a ride, but when she declined the future plans, he ended the date abruptly by leaving her to Uber.\n\nIs that wrong? Well, being abrupt and not being considerate of her transportation needs could be seen as inconsiderate. Since he was the one who picked her up, maybe he should have still offered to drive her home even after the conversation. Ending the date by telling her to take Uber might come off as rude or insensitive, especially after a positive initial interaction. So, the author might be in the wrong for not being understanding and for not ensuring her safe return home despite the rejection.\n"
