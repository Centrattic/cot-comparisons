She doesn\u2019t drive so I picked her up and we went out to a restaurant.  It was going well and I was enjoying getting to know her.  At the end I paid the check and asked her when we could go out again.  She told me she wasn\u2019t looking to date anyone right now.  I asked  her why did she come on a date with me then and she said that she just likes meeting new people.  I told her that she could catch an Uber home and left. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the guy went on a date with a girl he met on OkCupid. He picked her up because she doesn't drive. They had dinner, he paid, and then when she said she wasn't looking to date, he asked why she came on the date. She said she likes meeting new people. Then he told her to get an Uber home and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. When someone says they're not interested in dating, the appropriate response is to respect that and leave gracefully. The guy asked why she came on the date if she wasn't looking for a relationship, which might come off as confrontational. Then, instead of offering to drive her home (which he did earlier), he suggested an Uber. That seems abrupt and possibly dismissive. \n\nBut wait, maybe he was hurt and reacting emotionally. If she was using him for the experience without intending to pursue anything, his reaction could be seen as a defense mechanism. However, treating her rudely by making her take an Uber after she already said she's not interested might not be the best approach. \n\nAnother angle: did the author have the right to feel upset? Yes, but how he handled it matters. Ending the date by leaving her to find an Uber could be seen as cutting her off, which is harsh. Maybe a better approach would be to acknowledge her statement, thank her for the time, and then offer to drive her home politely. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The key points are his reaction to her rejection. By making her take an Uber instead of offering to drive her as before, he might be treating her poorly after she's already made her position clear. That could be seen as inconsiderate, even if he's upset. So the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong). But some might argue he had a right to leave, so maybe B. Hmm.\n"
