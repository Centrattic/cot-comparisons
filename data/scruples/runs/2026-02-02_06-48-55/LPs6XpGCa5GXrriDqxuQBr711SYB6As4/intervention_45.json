      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is wrong for telling their date to get an Uber after she said she's not looking for a relationship.\n\nFirst, the situation: They met on OkCupid, he picked her up because she doesn't drive. The date went well, he paid for the meal, then asked when they could go out again. She said she wasn't looking to date. He asked why she came on the date, she said she likes meeting new people. Then he told her to take an Uber home and left.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author paid for the date, which implies he might have been expecting a more serious interest. When she made it clear she's not interested in dating, he might have felt rejected. His response was to cut her off from a ride home, which could be seen as a bit of a passive-aggressive move. By telling her to get an Uber instead of offering to drop her off, he's leaving her with a fare that she might not have planned for, especially since she doesn't drive. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, she already stated her boundaries. He had the choice to either accept that and still be polite by driving her home, or to leave her to figure it out. By choosing the latter, he's being a bit spiteful. Even if she's not interested, it's considerate to offer a ride. But he's using the Uber as a way to end the interaction on his terms, maybe to make her feel the sting of rejection. \n\nBut wait, maybe he's just being assertive. If she's not interested, why should he have to drive her home? However, since he picked her up, it's customary to offer a ride back. Not doing so could be seen as rude. Also, since she doesn't drive, making her take an Uber might be inconvenient or costly. \n\nThe question is about whether he's at fault. From a social standpoint, even if you're upset, being polite and offering a ride home is the expected behavior. Cutting her off by forcing her to take an Uber instead of driving her might be seen as petty. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
