      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he went on a date with a girl he met on OkCupid. He picked her up because she doesn't drive, took her to a restaurant, paid the check, and then asked her out again. She said she's not looking to date, just likes meeting new people. Then he told her to get an Uber home and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and expectations here. When someone agrees to a date, especially a first date, there are certain unspoken rules about how to behave. The author picked her up, which is a kind gesture. Then he paid, which is typical in some cultures. However, when she said she's not looking to date, he seems a bit abrupt by telling her to take an Uber instead of offering to drive her home. \n\nWait, but she doesn't drive, so maybe she relies on others for transportation. By leaving her to get an Uber, maybe he's being inconsiderate. But she said she's not interested in dating, so maybe he felt hurt and wanted to end the date quickly. However, even if she's not interested, wouldn't it still be polite to offer to take her home? Especially since she doesn't have her own car. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's action of sending her an Uber was appropriate. If he was upset because she rejected him, it's understandable, but was it the right thing to do? Normally, even if the date doesn't go well, you'd still make sure the other person gets home safely. So maybe he was being harsh. \n\nBut then again, maybe she's not expecting him to do that if she's not interested in dating. However, the initial setup was that he picked her up, so she might have expected him to take her back. If he left abruptly, that could be seen as rude or dismissive. \n\nI think the issue is that by not offering to drive her back, he's not being a good sport. Even if she's not interested, being considerate is expected. So maybe the author is in the wrong here. But others might argue that he felt hurt and was acting on that, which is understandable. However, the act of leaving her to Uber instead of driving her home could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't handle the situation politely by not offering to take her home, even after she rejected him.\n"
