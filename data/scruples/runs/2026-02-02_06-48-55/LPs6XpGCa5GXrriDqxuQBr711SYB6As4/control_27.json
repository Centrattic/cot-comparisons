      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he went on a date with a woman he met on OkCupid. He picked her up because she doesn't drive, they went to a restaurant, and he paid. Then after the date, she said she's not looking to date anyone, and when he asked why she came on the date, she said she likes meeting new people. He then told her to get an Uber home and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He initiated the date, she agreed. She didn't drive, so he was kind enough to pick her up, which is a nice gesture. They had dinner, he paid, and the conversation went well. The problem arises when she ends the date by saying she's not looking for a relationship. He responds by not offering to drive her home, telling her to take an Uber instead. \n\nIs his reaction justified? Well, when someone says they're not interested in dating again, it's natural for the other person to feel disappointed or upset. The question is whether his response was appropriate. By not offering to drive her home, he might be showing a lack of consideration for her safety or convenience. However, given that she said she's not looking for a relationship, maybe he was just trying to distance himself and didn't want to prolong the interaction. \n\nBut wait, he had already picked her up earlier. If she doesn't drive, he might be the only one who can drive her home. If he left her with no other option than Uber, that could be a problem. But maybe she has other options? The story says she doesn't drive, so maybe Uber is her only option. But he told her to take an Uber, which could be abrupt. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, maybe he's reacting to being ghosted or to the rejection. But he did pay for the date, which is a common courtesy. However, after the rejection, his response was to not offer to drive her home. But he had already driven her there. If she's not interested in dating again, maybe he's just cutting off the interaction. \n\nThe community's response to an \"Am I the A$$hole?\" thread often hinges on whether the person's actions are inconsiderate or if they overreacted. In this case, the author's action of telling her to take an Uber after she said she's not looking for a relationship might be seen as a bit abrupt, but maybe he's justified in not wanting to continue the date. However, if she relies on him for transportation, he should have offered a ride home regardless of the rejection. \n\nSo, if she doesn't drive, and he's the one who picked her up, he might be responsible for getting her back. By not offering to drive her, he's leaving her stranded unless Uber is available. But if he left her with Uber, maybe that's a way to distance himself. However, the act of not providing a ride home might be inconsiderate. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being inconsiderate by not offering a ride home. If she's in an area where Uber isn't reliable, she might be stuck. But if he's just ending the interaction, maybe that's his right. However, since he's the one who picked her up, it's customary to offer a ride home regardless of the date's outcome. So in that sense, he might be in the wrong for not offering to drive her home after the rejection. \n\nBut then again, maybe he's just reacting to the rejection. The argument could be that he's not obligated to continue being nice after she said she's not interested. However, common courtesy usually dictates that you don't leave someone stranded, especially if they don't have their own transportation. \n\nSo the answer could be B (No), because he's not in the wrong, since he's reacting to her rejection. But others might argue that he's being inconsiderate by not providing a ride home. It's a bit of a gray area. But in a typical \"Am I the A$$hole?\" scenario, the community often looks for the most inconsiderate action. If he's being abrupt and not offering a ride home when she depends on him, then he's in the wrong. But if he's just ending the interaction, maybe not. \n\nHmm. I think I'm leaning towards B (No) because he's not obligated to continue the date after she said she's not interested. However, if she relies on him for transportation, he should have offered to drive her home regardless of the rejection. So maybe he is in the wrong for not offering a ride. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for telling her to get an Uber. If he's the only option, then he's inconsiderate. But if Uber is accessible, then it's fine. The story says she doesn't drive, so Uber might be her only option. But he told her to take Uber, which she might have to do, but he didn't offer to drive her home. Maybe he should have, regardless of the rejection. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (Yes) because he didn't offer a ride home, even after the rejection. But if he's the one who picked her up, he might be expected to drive her back. So he's in the wrong for not doing that.\n"
