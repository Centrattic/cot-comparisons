      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for telling their date to take an Uber after the date didn't go as planned. \n\nFirst, the situation: The person went on a date with a girl they met on OkCupid. He picked her up because she doesn't drive, they went to a restaurant, he paid, and then when she said she wasn't looking to date, he asked why she came on the date. She said she likes meeting people, and then he told her to take an Uber home and left.\n\nSo, the key points here. The guy arranged to pick her up, which implies he's taking responsibility for her getting home. But when the date didn't end with her wanting a relationship, he abruptly left her with the Uber suggestion. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider social norms. Typically, after a date, even if it's not going well, it's polite to see the other person home or ensure they get there safely. Since he had already picked her up, there might be an expectation that he would offer to drive her home again. By not doing so and instead telling her to take an Uber, he might be seen as being dismissive or rude, especially right after she ended things. \n\nBut wait, maybe he felt hurt or rejected. His reaction could be impulsive. However, the act of leaving her to find an Uber instead of offering to drive her home could be seen as lacking in consideration. Even if he was upset, ensuring her safety and convenience is important. \n\nAnother angle: Did he have a responsibility to drive her home? Since he picked her up, maybe he assumed she would ride back with him. But she might have expected that regardless of the date's outcome. By not following through, he might have made her uncomfortable, especially if she was in a new city without a car. \n\nAlso, the way he left\u2014saying she could catch an Uber and then leaving\u2014could be perceived as abrupt and possibly even unsafe if she had to hail a ride in an unfamiliar area. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong for not ensuring she got home safely after he had already taken her there. The action of telling her to take an Uber instead of offering to drive her back could be seen as inconsiderate and possibly even rude, especially after the date ended on a negative note for him.\n"
