At the end I paid the check and asked her when we could go out again.  She told me she wasn\u2019t looking to date anyone right now.  I asked  her why did she come on a date with me then and she said that she just likes meeting new people.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling a date to get an Uber after the date didn't go as planned. The situation is that the guy picked up the girl since she doesn't drive, they went to dinner, and then when she said she wasn't looking to date, he left her with an Uber suggestion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms here. When you pick someone up for a date, it's common to offer a ride home as part of being considerate. If the date ends abruptly because the other person isn't interested, leaving without ensuring they get home safely could be seen as inconsiderate. The author paid for the dinner, which is good, but leaving her stranded because she doesn't drive might be the issue.\n\nThe girl mentioned she doesn't drive, so relying on Uber makes sense, but the guy could have offered to wait with her or help her get the Uber. Just telling her to get an Uber and leaving might be abrupt. However, the guy was probably hurt and left quickly. But from a social standpoint, ensuring the date gets home safely is important, regardless of the outcome of the date.\n\nThe girl's response about not looking to date but still meeting could be a red flag, but that's on her. The guy's reaction is to leave, which is understandable emotionally, but maybe not the best action. So, the question is whether he's in the wrong for not helping her get home properly.\n\nI think the key point is that after the date, the guy should have made sure she got home safely. Telling her to get an Uber but not offering to assist might be insufficient. So, maybe he's in the wrong because he didn't follow through on providing a ride home. However, some might argue that since she doesn't drive, he had a responsibility to get her home, and leaving her with just an Uber instruction is the wrong move. So the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't ensure her safe return.\n"
