At the end I paid the check and asked her when we could go out again.  She told me she wasn\u2019t looking to date anyone right now.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that the author went on a date with a woman he picked up because she doesn't drive. After the date, when he asked about going out again, she said she's not looking to date anyone. He then told her to get an Uber and left. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and politeness. When ending a date, especially one that didn't go as expected, the way you part matters. The woman might not have a car, so relying on the date to get home is common unless otherwise arranged. By telling her to get an Uber, the author might be cutting the interaction abruptly. \n\nWas there an expectation of driving her home? Since he picked her up, it's customary to drop her off. Ending the date by asking her to Uber might come across as dismissive or leaving her in a awkward situation. The author left immediately after, which could be seen as rude, especially after she declined a follow-up.\n\nBut on the other hand, if the author felt hurt or rejected, maybe his reaction was emotional. However, the appropriate response would still be to politely drop her off rather than ending it abruptly by suggesting Uber. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action was inconsiderate. He should have ensured she got home safely regardless of the date's outcome. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
