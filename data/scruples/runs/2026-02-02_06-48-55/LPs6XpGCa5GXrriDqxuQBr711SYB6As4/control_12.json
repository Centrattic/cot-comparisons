      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for telling their date to get an Uber after she said she wasn't looking to date anyone. The situation is that they met on OkCupid, he picked her up because she doesn't drive, they went to a restaurant, he paid, and then she said she's not looking to date. When he asked why she came on the date, she said she likes meeting new people. Then he told her to get an Uber and left.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the actions of both parties. The author set up the date through a dating app, which implies there's an expectation of mutual interest in a romantic connection. However, the girl stated she wasn't looking to date but still went on the date. The key point here is whether her initial acceptance was deceptive or if she had a right to be honest upfront.\n\nWhen the author asked why she came on the date if she's not dating, she responded with a reason. The author's reaction was to cut things off by telling her to get an Uber and leaving. The question is whether that was inappropriate.\n\nConsider the context: he paid for the meal, which could be seen as a gesture of goodwill. However, she was clear about her intentions. The author might have felt disrespected or misled. But is ending the date abruptly the wrong move?\n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone is clear about their intentions, the other person is within their rights to end the interaction if they feel their time was wasted. Alternatively, some might argue that ending the date abruptly without offering alternative help (like driving her home) could be seen as rude, even if the person feels hurt. However, since she doesn't drive and he had already done the driving, maybe he felt he couldn't drive her home again. \n\nAlternatively, the author could have been more understanding. Maybe he should have let her catch an Uber but in a kinder way, rather than cutting off communication. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about being polite.\n\nThe girl's actions might be considered a bit disingenuous by some standards. However, the author's response was to leave quickly. While it's understandable he was upset, telling her to take an Uber might be seen as abrupt, but not necessarily wrong. He might have felt justified in ending the date quickly after learning her intentions.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be in the wrong because he had the right to end the date when he realized the situation didn't align with his expectations. However, some might argue that being more courteous would be better. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might be B (No).\n"
