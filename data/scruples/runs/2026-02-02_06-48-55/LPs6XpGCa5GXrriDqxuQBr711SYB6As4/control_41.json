      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he went on a date with a girl who doesn't drive. He picked her up, and after the date, when she said she wasn't looking to date, he told her to get an Uber. Then he left. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. He set up the date, paid for the dinner, and when she wasn't interested in continuing, he left her with an Uber suggestion. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nWell, he paid for the dinner, which is a common gesture on a date. But when she said she wasn't looking for a relationship, he reacted by telling her to take an Uber and leaving. That might come off as abrupt or maybe even a bit passive-aggressive. Did he have a responsibility to offer to drive her home instead? Since she doesn't drive, maybe he should have considered that. If he left her with the suggestion of Uber, but she might not have the means or money for it, that could be an issue. But the user says she didn't drive, but doesn't mention if she has a car or not. Wait, he picked her up, so maybe she doesn't own a car. If that's the case, Uber might be her only option. But if he left her with only that option, and she's in a situation where Uber isn't feasible, that's a problem. But the user might not know that. \n\nAlso, the girl said she's not looking to date, and when he asked why she came on the date, she said she likes meeting new people. That could imply that she knew the date wasn't going to lead to anything. But maybe the author felt slighted and reacted by leaving her with Uber instead of offering to drive her home. \n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone is not interested after a date, it's polite to offer help getting home, especially if they don't drive. If the author is upset, he might be taking his feelings out on her by not offering to drive her. But since he paid for the meal, maybe he expected a different outcome. However, the girl was clear she wasn't interested in a relationship. \n\nSo, was the author in the wrong by not offering to drive her home instead of leaving her with Uber? If he had a car, he could have driven her. But maybe he was mad and left without considering that. Alternatively, maybe he thought Uber was sufficient. But if she doesn't drive, she might not have the app or the money. The author might be wrong because he didn't ensure she got home safely, especially after she said she wasn't interested. \n\nBut another angle: He asked her why she came on the date if she wasn't interested. That could be seen as confrontational. Then when she explained, he told her to take Uber and left. That might be a reaction to her not being interested, but cutting her off like that could be inconsiderate. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be at fault for not offering to drive her home and for acting dismissively after the date didn't go as he hoped. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
