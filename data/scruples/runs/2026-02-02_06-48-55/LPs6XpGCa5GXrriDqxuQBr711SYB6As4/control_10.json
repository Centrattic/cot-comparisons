      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went on a date with a woman, picked her up since she doesn't drive, paid for dinner. After the date, when asked when they can go out again, she said she's not looking to date anyone. He then told her to get an Uber home and left.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the social norms here. When someone ends a date, especially if it's going to be a one-time thing, how should they handle the logistics of getting home? The author picked her up, so maybe driving her back is expected. But the woman said she doesn't drive, so perhaps Uber is the alternative. However, leaving her alone to get an Uber might come off as abrupt or insensitive. \n\nWait, the key points here are: She ended the date by saying she's not interested in dating. The author felt rejected but still offered to help her get home. But instead of offering to drive her back, he told her to take an Uber and left. That might be seen as cutting the conversation off too quickly, especially after the awkward rejection. \n\nIs it wrong to not offer a ride home? If she doesn't have a car, maybe it's expected for the person who picked her up to drive her back. The author might have felt hurt and wanted to leave quickly, but that could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nAlternatively, if she's not interested, maybe the author shouldn't have continued the date in the first place. But the date was already happening, and it's customary to be polite and offer a ride home regardless of the outcome. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not providing a ride back, especially since she doesn't drive. Telling her to get an Uber and leaving could be seen as dismissive or not considering her safety. Even if he was hurt, it's important to be courteous. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. If he was upset, maybe he should have said goodbye politely but still offered to drive her or ensure she gets home safely. Leaving her to figure out Uber alone might not be the best choice, especially if she's in an unfamiliar area or it's late. \n\nIn many dating scenarios, even if the date is over, it's customary to drive the other person home. So the author's action of leaving her to take an Uber could be seen as a breach of etiquette. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. \n\nWait, the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author was hurt and left quickly, is that acceptable? Or is it expected to handle it more gracefully? The key is whether his action of not providing a ride was wrong. Since she didn't drive, maybe he should have driven her home regardless of the date's outcome. So, by telling her to get an Uber and leaving, he's not fulfilling the social expectation. Hence, he's in the wrong.\n"
