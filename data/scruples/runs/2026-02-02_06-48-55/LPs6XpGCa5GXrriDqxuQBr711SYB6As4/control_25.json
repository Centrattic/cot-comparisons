      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling a date to get an Uber after she said she wasn't looking to date anyone.\n\nFirst, the situation: They met on OkCupid, he asked her out, picked her up because she doesn't drive, had dinner. She said she's not looking to date, but likes meeting new people. He then tells her to take an Uber home and leaves.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here. Did he do something wrong? Well, he paid for the dinner, which is common in some dating cultures, but she made it clear she wasn't interested in a relationship. His response was to tell her to take an Uber and leave. Was that abrupt or rude?\n\nWait, she said she doesn't drive, so he picked her up. After the date, he's leaving and telling her to take an Uber. Maybe he felt hurt or rejected, so he was abrupt. But did he have a right to be upset? She was honest about her intentions from the start. Maybe she just wanted to meet people without commitment, and he went in expecting a potential relationship. So when she turned down a follow-up, he felt disrespected or used.\n\nBut telling her to get an Uber could be seen as dismissive. However, he was the one who paid for the dinner. Maybe he expected her to take responsibility or acknowledge his gesture? Or maybe he was just upset and wanted to leave quickly. \n\nIs there a social norm that he violated? If she said she's not interested, then cutting off communication abruptly might not be the best approach, but telling her to take an Uber isn't necessarily wrong. She doesn't have his address to go back with him, so Uber is a logical way for her to get home. \n\nAlternatively, maybe he should have offered to drive her home regardless, even after the rejection, as a polite gesture. But she doesn't drive, so he was the one who picked her up. If he's leaving, maybe she knows how to get home. \n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gray area. The main issue is whether his reaction was appropriate. If she was honest from the start, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he felt hurt and responded in a way that was cold, that could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think the key here is that she was upfront about her intentions. He asked why she came on a date, and she explained. He then left her with an Uber suggestion. Since she doesn't drive, Uber is a reasonable option. He might have been trying to end the conversation politely, not wanting to prolong the interaction. So, maybe he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
