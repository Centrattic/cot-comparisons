We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking his female friend's bikini photo, with his girlfriend considering it as minor cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and the friend are good friends, have known each other for a long time, meet occasionally, and have mutual agreements that they only want friendship. They like each other's posts regularly. The issue arose when the author liked a photo of her in a bikini, which his girlfriend interpreted as a sign of attraction and cheating.\n\nThe author's girlfriend believes that there's no such thing as a female friend without romantic feelings, leading her to see the like as a betrayal. The author feels this is unfair because he and the friend have agreed on just friendship, and he doesn't see the like as a big deal.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an objective standpoint, liking a photo is a common interaction on social media. If both parties are clear about their boundaries and intentions, a simple like might not be a breach. However, in a relationship, what one person considers innocent, the other might see as crossing a line, especially if there's insecurity or past issues.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and mutual understanding. If the author's actions, even if minor, make his partner feel insecure, then maybe he should reconsider or communicate better. But if there's no prior discussion about what's acceptable, it's hard to say he's wrong. However, in relationships, actions that hurt the partner's feelings can be seen as the person's fault if they didn't take the other's perspective into account.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is influenced by her belief that female friendships inherently lead to romantic feelings. That's a personal belief, but if the author knew this might upset her, he should be more cautious. On the other hand, avoiding all social media interactions might be unrealistic.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a gray area. But since the girlfriend is feeling hurt and the author could have been more mindful of her feelings, maybe he is partially responsible. However, if there was no prior indication that this would be an issue, it's less clear. The answer depends on whether the action was intentional to provoke or if he genuinely didn't consider her feelings. Given the information, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), but some might argue B (No) if they see the like as innocent.\n"
