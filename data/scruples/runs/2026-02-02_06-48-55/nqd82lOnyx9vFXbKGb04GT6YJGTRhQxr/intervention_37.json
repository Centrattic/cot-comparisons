We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking his female friend's bikini photo on Facebook, as his girlfriend considers it minor cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has a long-term female friend, and they've both agreed they don't want a romantic relationship. They meet occasionally and have a platonic friendship. The author likes her Facebook posts, including a specific bikini photo. His girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and cheating.\n\nNow, the core issue is whether liking a photo constitutes cheating. The author argues it's just a friendly gesture, but the girlfriend feels betrayed. The author's defense is that they're just friends and there's no romantic intent. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that any form of attention, even a like, could indicate attraction and is thus a betrayal.\n\nI should consider both sides. From the author's view, if there's no romantic interest and they're clear about their boundaries, a like is a normal social interaction. But the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. Cheating definitions can vary in relationships. Some people might see emotional or physical affection towards others as cheating, even if there's no actual infidelity.\n\nThe key here is communication. The author didn't realize his actions upset his girlfriend. If the girlfriend expressed her boundaries clearly, and the author knew and still did it, then he might be at fault. But if the girlfriend didn't specify that liking photos is an issue, it's more about differing expectations. However, in many relationships, partners expect their significant other to avoid showing affection towards others that could be misinterpreted.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's belief that \"there's no such thing as a female friend\" suggests she's uncomfortable with the friendship structure. The author might need to reassess how he interacts with this friend to respect his girlfriend's feelings. While the act itself is minor, the impact on the relationship is significant.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the agreed-upon boundaries in the relationship. If the girlfriend clearly indicated that liking such photos is a problem, then the author is at fault. If not, it's a matter of differing expectations. However, since the girlfriend is upset, the author should consider adjusting his behavior to maintain trust, even if he feels it's trivial. So, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because he didn't consider his actions from his girlfriend's perspective and didn't adjust to respect her feelings.\n"
