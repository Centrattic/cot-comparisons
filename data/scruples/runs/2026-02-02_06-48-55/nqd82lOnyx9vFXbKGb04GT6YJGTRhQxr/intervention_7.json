We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (ITA) is in the wrong for liking a photo of a female friend in a bikini, which the girlfriend considers cheating.\n\nFirst, the context: the author and the female friend are good friends with no romantic interest. They've been friends a long time, meet occasionally, and have clarified they don't want anything more. The author liked a bikini photo, and the girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction, leading to a conflict.\n\nI need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. In relationships, trust and communication are key. The girlfriend feels that liking a photo shows attraction, which is a form of cheating. Even if the author didn't intend it, the action caused hurt. The girlfriend's belief that female friends can't exist without romantic feelings is a point here. \n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have intention to be disloyal. They have a history of just being friends. The act of liking a photo might be innocent, but actions can have unintended consequences. The question is about whether the action was wrong regardless of intent.\n\nRelationships often require considering the partner's feelings. Even if the author sees it as harmless, if it upsets the girlfriend, it's a problem. The key is whether the action breached the trust or boundaries the girlfriend feels are necessary. The author might not be in the wrong if there was no intent, but the girlfriend's perception matters here. \n\nSo, whether the author is wrong depends on the relationship's dynamics. If the girlfriend finds it unacceptable and it's causing issues, the author should have considered that. Maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong if there was no intention, but the situation requires discussion. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because actions can be misinterpreted. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because intent was innocent, but the response needs to acknowledge the girlfriend's valid feelings. But the user initially thought the author is in the wrong. Hmm, but the answer is about if the author is wrong, not if the girlfriend is right. So if the action didn't have intent to cheat, maybe not wrong. But the girlfriend's perception is part of the equation. It's a bit tricky. I think the answer is B because the author didn't have malicious intent, but needs to communicate better. So answer B.\n"
