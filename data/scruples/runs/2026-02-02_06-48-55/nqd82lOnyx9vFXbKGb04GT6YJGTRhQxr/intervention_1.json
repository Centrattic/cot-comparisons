We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about liking a female friend's bikini photo on Facebook, and the girlfriend considers it a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, the author and the female friend have been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and both have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. The author likes her photos on Facebook, including a bikini picture, which the girlfriend interprets as a sign of attraction or cheating. The girlfriend's point of view is that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" and that any closeness might lead to cheating. The author thinks the girlfriend is being unfair.\n\nSo, the key points here are the definitions of cheating and the boundaries in the relationships. Cheating typically involves engaging in a romantic or sexual relationship with someone other than one's partner. Liking a photo is a public action but not a physical interaction. However, the girlfriend's hurt feelings suggest that there's a breach of emotional boundaries.\n\nThe question is whether liking a photo crosses the line into emotional infidelity. Emotional infidelity can be considered if one partner feels neglected or if actions are seen as flirtatious. The author's friend is in a bikini, which might be seen as a more provocative context. The fact that the author and the friend have stated they don't want anything more might mean that the author's actions are not intentional, but the girlfriend's perception is that it's a sign of attraction. \n\nThe author might not intend to flirt, but the girlfriend's insecurities are valid. In relationships, actions that make a partner feel insecure can be problematic even if unintended. The author could be in the wrong if they didn't consider their girlfriend's feelings and the context of liking a revealing photo. Alternatively, if it's just a friendly action and the girlfriend is overreacting, then maybe not. But since the girlfriend interprets it as attraction, and the author's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary, the author might be at fault for not respecting the partner's feelings. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a nuance here. Maybe the issue is more about communication rather than the action itself. If the author didn't realize the girlfriend felt that way, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend has previously expressed discomfort, then the author should be more cautious. The scenario doesn't mention prior discussions, so it's ambiguous. Given the girlfriend's perspective, the answer might be A, but I'm a bit torn. Hmm.\n"
