We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking a bikini photo of a female friend, as his girlfriend considers it a form of cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has a long-time female friend with whom they have a platonic relationship. They met occasionally, do casual things like watch movies, eat, and drink. Both have explicitly stated they don't want anything more than friendship. The issue arises when the author liked a photo of the friend in a bikini on Facebook. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of physical attraction and considers it cheating.\n\nThe key points here are the definitions of cheating and how different people perceive boundaries. Cheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity. However, liking a photo is a public interaction, not a private one. The author and the friend have no romantic intentions, and they maintain a clear boundary in their friendship. \n\nBut the girlfriend's perspective is that such an action shows attraction. This could be a matter of trust and personal boundaries. The author might not see the like as a big deal, but if the girlfriend feels it's a breach of trust, there's a communication gap. \n\nHowever, liking a photo isn't an act of betrayal unless both parties agreed that such actions are off-limits. The author didn't engage in any physical or emotional intimacy with the friend. The issue seems more about the girlfriend's insecurities rather than the author's wrongdoing. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on mutual understanding. If there's no prior agreement that liking photos is forbidden, then the author isn't necessarily at fault. The real problem might be the girlfriend's interpretation and the lack of communication about boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be that the author isn't wrong.\n"
