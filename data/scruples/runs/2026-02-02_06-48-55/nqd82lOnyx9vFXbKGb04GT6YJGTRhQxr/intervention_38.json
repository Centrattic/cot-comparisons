We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about liking a female friend's bikini photo on Facebook, which the girlfriend considers cheating. The author says they have a long-standing, platonic friendship with clear boundaries, and they both agreed they don't want anything more. The girlfriend, however, feels that liking the photo shows attraction and is a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationships involved. The key points are the existing friendship, mutual understanding of non-romantic intentions, and the girlfriend's perspective. The author argues that the like was just a friendly gesture, part of their usual interaction. But the girlfriend sees it as crossing a boundary, implying attraction.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. Even if the author didn't intend any harm, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. If she interprets the action as a breach of trust, then the author might need to reassess their actions to respect her feelings. The fact that they met occasionally and have a close friendship might make the girlfriend more sensitive about interactions with others.\n\nHowever, the author maintains that there's no romantic intent and that the friendship is purely platonic. The question is whether liking a photo, especially a bikini one, is inherently a boundary-crossing act. Some people might see it as harmless, while others might take it as flirtatious. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that she feels insecure or that the action undermines the trust in the relationship.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the action was intentional in a way that could be seen as flirtatious. If the author didn't intend to flirt, but the action still causes distress, then maybe they are at fault for not considering the girlfriend's perspective enough. On the other hand, if the girlfriend is overreacting based on her own insecurities without valid reason, the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nBut relationships require both partners to communicate their boundaries. If the girlfriend had previously expressed discomfort with such likes, then the author should avoid them. Since there's no mention of prior communication about this, but the girlfriend's reaction is that it's a form of cheating, it's possible the author didn't realize the gravity of the action from her viewpoint.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have malicious intent, they might be in the wrong for not acknowledging the girlfriend's feelings and respecting her boundaries, even if they're not aware of them. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn because it's subjective. However, in relationship conflicts, if one partner feels wronged, the other should consider that.\n"
