We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author liked a bikini photo of a female friend on Facebook, and their girlfriend considers that \"minor cheating.\" The author argues that they've been friends for a long time, there's no attraction, and they just like each other's posts normally. The girlfriend's perspective is that any liking of a picture like that implies attraction and could lead to something more, so it's cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationships. The key here is the girlfriend's feelings and the boundaries she sets. The author believes their actions are innocent, but the girlfriend is hurt and sees it as a betrayal. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not just whether the action is objectively wrong, but if their actions crossed a line in the context of their relationship.\n\nIn many relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If the girlfriend feels that liking such a photo is a breach of trust, even if the author didn't intend it that way, the impact matters. The girlfriend's view is that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" without attraction, which might reflect her insecurities or past experiences. However, the author's action, while perhaps meant as just a friendly like, can be seen as disrespectful to the girlfriend's boundaries if they knew or should have known that this would upset her.\n\nThe author's defense is that they've always been friends and there's no attraction. But if the girlfriend interprets the like as a sign of attraction, the author might be neglecting her feelings. Even if the author didn't mean to, if the girlfriend is hurt, then the author should consider her perspective. The fact that they like each other's posts normally might be a red flag if the girlfriend finds it problematic. The author could have asked if it was okay or discussed boundaries to avoid this situation.\n\nOn the other hand, it's possible that the girlfriend is overreacting, but that doesn't make the author right if their action caused distress. Relationships require both partners to respect each other's feelings. If the author knew or should have known that this action would hurt her, then they are at fault. The author's responsibility is to communicate and adjust their behavior to maintain the relationship's health.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's action disregarded the girlfriend's feelings, even if unintentionally. Since the girlfriend interprets it as cheating and the author's defense is about intent rather than impact, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
