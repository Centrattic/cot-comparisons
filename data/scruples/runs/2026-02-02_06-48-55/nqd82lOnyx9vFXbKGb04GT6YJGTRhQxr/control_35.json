We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo is in the wrong, as per their girlfriend's claim of it being a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, the context: the friend is a long-time, platonic friend they see occasionally. They've both agreed it's just a friendship with no romantic interest. They often like each other's posts on Facebook. The girlfriend is upset because the like on the bikini photo is seen as a sign of attraction, which she interprets as cheating.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points are the nature of the relationship between the author and the friend. Since they've both explicitly stated there's no romantic interest, the friendship is supposed to be platonic. Liking a photo is a common social media action, but the girlfriend feels it crosses a boundary. \n\nHowever, whether it's wrong depends on the dynamics between the couple. Trust and communication are crucial in relationships. If the author didn't have intentions beyond friendship, then the action itself isn't inherently wrong. But the girlfriend's perception matters here. The issue might be more about her insecurities or boundaries she hasn't discussed with him. \n\nThe author could be in the right if he didn't act on any attraction and maintained the friendship as agreed. But if there's a lack of communication about what's acceptable in the relationship, then maybe both sides have a point. However, based on the info given, the author didn't act with malicious intent, so it's not necessarily his fault. The answer is B.\n"
