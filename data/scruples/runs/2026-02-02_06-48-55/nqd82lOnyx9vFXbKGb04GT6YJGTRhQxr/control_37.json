We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for liking a bikini photo of a female friend on Facebook, and his girlfriend considers it minor cheating.\n\nFirst, the key points: the friend is female, they've been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and have clarified that they don't have romantic intentions. The boyfriend liked her photo on Facebook, which is a common action, but his girlfriend feels it's a form of cheating because she interprets it as attraction.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" without potential for more, leading to cheating. The boyfriend thinks it's unfair and wants to know if he's the asshole.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship boundaries. Liking a friend's photo, especially if it's a common practice between them, might not inherently be wrong. However, if the girlfriend feels uncomfortable or sees it as a breach of trust, that's about their specific relationship dynamics.\n\nThe story mentions that they usually like each other's posts, so this might be a habitual action, not a specific act of attraction. The girlfriend's interpretation could be influenced by her own insecurities or different views on what constitutes appropriate interaction with friends of the opposite sex.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the boyfriend wasn't aware that this action was bothering his girlfriend, but after she expressed it, he should respect her feelings. The fact that they had already established their boundaries as just friends might mitigate the intention behind the like, but the girlfriend's perception is crucial here.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Liking the photo itself isn't necessarily unethical, but if the girlfriend sees it as cheating, then not respecting her boundaries could be an issue. The question is whether the like crossed a line that was agreed upon. Since the friend is a \"female friend\" and there's no indication of romantic feelings, the action might not be wrong. But the girlfriend's reaction is valid if that's her understanding of the relationship. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer could be B, but depends on the context of their agreement. If they agreed not to interact in ways that could be seen as flirtatious, then maybe A. However, the user says they didn't have any attraction and it's just a friend, so B might be the case here.\n"
