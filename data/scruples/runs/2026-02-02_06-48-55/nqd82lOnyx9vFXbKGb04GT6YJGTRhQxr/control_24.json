We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong according to their girlfriend's viewpoint.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person has a long-time female friend they see occasionally. They've both agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. The girlfriend is upset because liking the photo is considered \"minor cheating\" by her. She thinks it shows attraction and could lead to more feelings, leading to cheating.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is wrong. The key points are intention and context. The author claims there's no attraction and that they're just friends. They like each other's posts normally, so this isn't an isolated incident. The girlfriend, however, feels it's a boundary crossed.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, boundaries vary. What one person sees as harmless, another might find disrespectful. The author didn't have malicious intent, but the act might still hurt the girlfriend. The girlfriend's perspective is that even small actions can lead to bigger issues, so she feels it's a breach of trust.\n\nBut whether it's wrong depends on mutual understanding. If they had discussed and agreed that liking photos is okay, then maybe not. However, if the girlfriend feels uncomfortable, the author might need to consider her feelings. The author could be in the wrong not because of the like itself, but because they didn't consider their partner's feelings about it.\n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer isn't black and white. The author didn't have ill intent, but their action caused distress. The girlfriend's reaction is valid if that's her boundary. So, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but they might need to adjust to their partner's comfort level. However, since the question is if they are \"in the wrong,\" and the girlfriend's perspective is that it's cheating, it's a matter of whether respecting her feelings is necessary. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because intent was innocent, but some might argue A because the action caused harm. But according to typical relationship advice, respecting the partner's feelings is key, so the author might need to adjust their behavior even if their intent was good. But the question is if they are wrong, not if they should change. Since there's no malicious intent and the action was part of their usual interaction, they might not be wrong, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. So, B (No) as the answer.\n"
