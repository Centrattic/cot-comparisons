We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo is in the wrong according to their girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, the context: The friend in question is someone they've known for a long time, meet occasionally, and have clearly stated there's no romantic interest. They like each other's Facebook posts regularly, and the girlfriend is upset about a like on a bikini photo. The girlfriend interprets the like as a sign of attraction and considers it \"minor cheating.\"\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries in relationships and how actions are perceived. The author argues that the like is a usual interaction, part of their friendship, and that there's no romantic intent. The girlfriend, however, feels that any form of attention to an ex or close friend, especially in revealing attire, is a breach of trust.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust and communication are crucial. If the girlfriend feels that this action undermines her trust, then the author might be in the wrong not because the action itself is inherently wrong, but because it disregards her feelings and the agreed-upon boundaries. Even if the author didn't intend it, the impact on the partner matters in a relationship. The girlfriend's perspective is that maintaining emotional boundaries with exes or close friends is important to prevent potential issues. \n\nThe author might not see it as wrong because they don't feel any attraction and consider it a normal friendship interaction. However, in relationships, partners often have different comfort levels. The issue here is about respecting those boundaries. The girlfriend's statement that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" in this context suggests she's concerned about even minor interactions leading to jealousy or infidelity. \n\nSo, the question is whether respecting the partner's feelings and boundaries takes precedence over the author's intention. If the author knows their partner is uncomfortable and continues the action, that could be seen as disrespectful. On the other hand, if the action is something that's common and the author believes it's harmless, there's a case for their side. But since the girlfriend is equating the like to cheating, the author's action might be crossing a line they didn't realize was set. \n\nUltimately, it's about mutual respect. If the girlfriend's feelings are valid, then the author's action, even if unintentional, is causing harm. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong from the girlfriend's perspective. However, there's also a counter-argument that the author isn't cheating, just not considering the partner's sensitivity. But in the context of the girlfriend's viewpoint, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
