We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking a friend's Facebook photo where the friend is in a bikini. The girlfriend considers this a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, the context is that the author and this female friend have been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and have clearly stated they don't want anything more than friendship. They often like each other's posts, which is a common social behavior on social media. The issue arises from the girlfriend's perspective that liking a bikini photo implies attraction, which the author didn't intend.\n\nThe author's argument is that they have a platonic relationship and that the like was just a friendly gesture. However, the girlfriend feels that such actions can lead to deeper feelings and cheating. The key here is the girlfriend's feelings and the context of their relationship. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, the action still hurt their partner. In relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If the girlfriend feels insecure about this, it's important for the author to consider her feelings. But does liking a photo cross a line into cheating? Cheating typically involves romantic or sexual infidelity. A like, without any further interaction, might not meet that threshold. However, the perception here is that it's a sign of attraction, which could be seen as emotional cheating depending on the couple's boundaries. The author might not be in the wrong if they didn't have ill intentions, but they should address their partner's concerns. It's more about the girlfriend's insecurity and how the couple defines their boundaries. The answer might hinge on whether the act of liking the photo, regardless of intent, breaches the trust or boundaries the couple has established. If the girlfriend defines it as cheating, even without malicious intent, the author might need to apologize or adjust their behavior to respect her feelings. But strictly speaking, is it cheating? It's debatable. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation. Since the girlfriend is upset and the author's action, though innocent, caused distress, it's possible the author is not in the wrong, but they should still communicate better with their partner.\n"
