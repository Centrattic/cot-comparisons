We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, as labeled as \"minor cheating\" by their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions that they have a long-term friendship with this woman, and both have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They meet occasionally, and they both like each other's Facebook posts. The issue arose when the author liked a photo of her in a bikini. The girlfriend sees this as cheating because it's a sign of physical attraction.\n\nThe key points here are the definitions of cheating and the boundaries in a relationship. The girlfriend believes that liking a photo equates to being physically attracted and thus cheating. The author argues that it's just a friendly gesture and that they have no romantic intentions towards the friend.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If the girlfriend feels uncomfortable with the author liking photos of the friend, especially one in a bikini, it's important to understand her perspective. Some people might see liking a photo as a way to show appreciation of appearance, which could be interpreted as flirtation or attraction. However, the author maintains that they only like the friend's posts out of friendliness, not attraction.\n\nHowever, the problem isn't just about the act of liking the photo itself, but how the girlfriend perceives it. If the girlfriend believes that any public affection towards another person of the opposite sex, especially in a revealing photo, is a form of cheating, then the author might be in the wrong if they ignored her feelings and continued such actions without addressing her concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be in the wrong if they genuinely have no romantic intentions and the friend is completely aware of the platonic nature of their relationship. The issue here could stem more from the girlfriend's insecurities or different interpretations of what constitutes cheating.\n\nBut in many relationships, public displays of affection or attention towards other people can cause jealousy, even if unintended. The author's actions, while not malicious, might still hurt the girlfriend. Therefore, the author should consider the girlfriend's feelings and possibly adjust their behavior to respect her boundaries, even if they don't see the action as cheating themselves.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author's action might not be malicious, but it's possible they are in the wrong because they didn't take into account their girlfriend's feelings and the potential for misinterpretation. The right approach would be to communicate and set boundaries that make the girlfriend feel secure.\n"
