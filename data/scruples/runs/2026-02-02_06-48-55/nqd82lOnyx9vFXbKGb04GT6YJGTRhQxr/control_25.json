We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking a friend's bikini photo, with the girlfriend considering it cheating. \n\nFirst, the context: the friend is a long-time, platonic friend. They meet occasionally and have no romantic or sexual interest in each other. The author likes her posts on Facebook, including this particular bikini photo. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of physical attraction and cheating.\n\nThe key points here are the definitions of cheating and what actions constitute betrayal in a relationship. Cheating typically involves a breach of the relationship's boundaries, which can vary between couples. The girlfriend believes that liking the photo shows attraction, which she equates to cheating. However, the author sees it as a harmless, friendly interaction. \n\nFriendships can involve affectionate gestures that don't imply romantic intent. Liking a photo, especially when done reciprocally and without any other context, might not be intended as a romantic act. But the perception here is crucial. The girlfriend feels hurt and sees it as a violation of trust, which is significant in relationship dynamics. \n\nCommunication is key. The author might not have intended to cross any boundaries, but the girlfriend's perspective is valid because she feels wronged. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the action was a breach of the agreed-upon boundaries in their relationship. If the couple hasn't discussed what's acceptable regarding social media interactions, the author might not realize the impact. \n\nHowever, since the girlfriend interprets it as cheating, the author's responsibility is to respect her feelings and adjust their behavior to maintain trust. Even if the author sees it as innocent, the action can still be considered wrong if it causes harm in the relationship. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the answer isn't straightforward. But since the girlfriend's feeling is valid and the action caused distress, the author might be in the wrong for not being more considerate of her feelings, even if unintentionally. However, it's also important to note that the author's intention wasn't malicious. It's a nuanced situation where both parties need to communicate better. \n\nIn the end, the answer hinges on whether the action, regardless of intent, violated the relationship's boundaries as perceived by the girlfriend. If the couple hasn't set clear boundaries, the author might not be fully at fault. But if they have established such boundaries, then yes, it's wrong. Given the information, the answer leans towards B, the author isn't in the wrong, but there's a need for better communication.\n"
