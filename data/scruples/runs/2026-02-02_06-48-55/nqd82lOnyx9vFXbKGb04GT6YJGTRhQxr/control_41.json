We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, as per their girlfriend's claim that it's a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend is someone they've known a long time, meet occasionally, and both have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They usually like each other's posts. The girlfriend is upset because the like on the bikini photo is seen as showing attraction, hence cheating.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the relationship with the female friend, the act of liking the photo, and the girlfriend's perspective. The author argues it's just a friendly gesture, but the girlfriend feels it's crossing a boundary.\n\nFrom a general standpoint, whether this is cheating depends on the couple's agreed boundaries. If the girlfriend interprets a like as a sign of attraction or inappropriate interest, then not respecting that boundary could be seen as wrong. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the girlfriend's feelings matter in the relationship. The author might need to consider her perspective and adjust their actions to honor the relationship's terms.\n\nHowever, some might argue that liking a photo is a common social interaction and not inherently cheating unless both parties have explicitly agreed that it's off-limits. But since the girlfriend is upset and sees it as cheating, the author's actions, even unintentionally, have caused harm. The question is whether the author is at fault for not respecting their partner's feelings and boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the girlfriend has expressed that such actions are a deal-breaker, then the author might be in the wrong for not heeding her concerns. It's about mutual respect and understanding. So even if the author didn't intend to cheat, the act of liking the photo in this context might be seen as crossing a line from the girlfriend's viewpoint.\n"
