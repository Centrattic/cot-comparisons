We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for liking a bikini photo of a female friend on Facebook. The girlfriend called it \"minor cheating.\" The author has had a long-term, platonic relationship with this friend, where they hang out occasionally and do normal friend things. They both have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. The author usually likes her posts, including this one, and the SO is upset because it's seen as a sign of attraction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's actions are based on their usual behavior of liking posts. Liking a photo isn't necessarily a big gesture, but the girlfriend feels it crosses a line. The concept of \"female friends\" here is tricky. The girlfriend's POV is that there's no such thing as just friends and that one will inevitably develop feelings. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The author might not have intended to cause harm, but the action still affects their partner. Even if the intention was innocent, if the partner feels it's cheating, it's a problem. The idea of \"minor cheating\" could relate to emotional infidelity. However, liking a post is a small action. But maybe the girlfriend is sensitive about the friend's appearance or there's a history of jealousy. \n\nThe author's argument is that it's just a like and they're just friends. But the girlfriend's feelings shouldn't be dismissed. The author might be in the wrong if they didn't consider their partner's perspective and if the like was a recurring thing that the SO found offensive. On the other hand, if the girlfriend hasn't communicated her boundaries clearly before, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But the situation is that the author was told it's a form of cheating, so they should respect that. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A. The author is in the wrong because actions that a partner perceives as cheating, even if intended as innocent, can be problematic if not discussed and if the partner feels betrayed. The key is respecting the partner's feelings and the boundaries in the relationship.\n"
