We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he liked his female friend's bikini photo on Facebook, and his girlfriend considers that \"minor cheating.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been a long-time friend, they meet occasionally, and they've both agreed they don't want a romantic relationship. They like each other's posts, and he liked a bikini photo. The girlfriend feels that liking the photo shows attraction, which is cheating.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he thinks it's just a friendly gesture, part of their usual interaction. But the girlfriend is interpreting it as a sign of attraction. The question is whether he's wrong to like the photo, even if he didn't mean it that way.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The girlfriend feels betrayed because she believes the action crosses a line. Even if the author didn't intend it as attraction, his action might be perceived as such. The issue here is about boundaries and how actions can affect a partner's feelings.\n\nIs liking a photo of a friend in a bikini inherently wrong? It depends on the relationship's norms. If both partners are comfortable with it, maybe not. But if the girlfriend is uncomfortable, then the author should consider her feelings. However, is it cheating? That's subjective. Cheating typically involves a breach of trust or agreed-upon boundaries. If they had an understanding that such actions are off-limits, then yes. But if not, maybe not.\n\nThe author says they've both stated they don't want more than friendship, so he might think his actions are harmless. But the girlfriend's perception is that it's a step towards infidelity. The problem is whether the action, regardless of intent, is a violation of their relationship boundaries.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If he didn't intend to attract attention and they have a history of mutual liking, it's possible he's not in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend feels wronged and the author should have been more mindful of her feelings, then maybe he is. The key is whether the action, even if innocent, caused harm. Since the girlfriend is upset and considers it cheating, the author might need to address her feelings even if he doesn't see it the same way.\n\nI think the answer here is that the author is not in the wrong (B), but it's important for him to communicate and understand his girlfriend's perspective. However, the question is whether he's the asshole, and from the story, he might not be. The girlfriend's interpretation is based on her own feelings, but the act itself isn't necessarily a betrayal unless boundaries were clearly set. So, answer B.\n"
