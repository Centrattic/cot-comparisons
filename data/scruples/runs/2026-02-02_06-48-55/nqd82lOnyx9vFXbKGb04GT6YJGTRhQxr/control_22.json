We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo is in the wrong, considering their girlfriend called it minor cheating. The situation involves a long-term friendship where both parties have stated they don't want anything more than friendship. The key points here are the nature of the relationship between the author and the friend, the act of liking the photo, and the girlfriend's perception.\n\nFirst, the author and the female friend are good friends who meet occasionally. They've both agreed that their relationship is platonic. The author likes the friend's posts, including a bikini photo, which the girlfriend interprets as a sign of attraction. The girlfriend's perspective is that any like from a male friend could indicate hidden feelings leading to cheating. The author feels this is unfair.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The act of liking a photo, especially on social media, is often a casual action. However, in the context of a relationship, actions can have different meanings based on the partner's feelings and expectations. The girlfriend's reaction stems from insecurity or a belief that maintaining a female friend is risky. The author's defense is that the friendship is purely platonic and they've both agreed to that.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. Social norms vary, and what's acceptable to one person might not be to another. The author didn't have malicious intent, but the girlfriend feels hurt. In relationships, communication and mutual understanding are key. If the girlfriend feels that such likes are a problem, the author might need to address it to respect their partner's feelings, even if they see it as harmless.\n\nHowever, the act itself isn't inherently wrong. The author isn't doing anything that violates the explicit agreements they have with their friend. The issue is more about the girlfriend's interpretation. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but they could be expected to adjust their behavior if it's causing distress to their partner. The answer hinges on whether the action breaches the trust or boundaries in the relationship, which is a matter of perspective.\n"
