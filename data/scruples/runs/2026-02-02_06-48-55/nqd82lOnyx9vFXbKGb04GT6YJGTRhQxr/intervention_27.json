We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking a photo of a female friend in a bikini, which his girlfriend considers minor cheating.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The friend in question is someone they've known for a long time, meet occasionally, and both have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They usually like each other's posts on Facebook. The issue here is the specific like on a bikini photo. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction, leading her to label it as cheating.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he sees it as a harmless action, part of their usual interaction. He maintains there's no attraction and that their friendship is platonic. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that liking a photo of someone in a bikini implies physical attraction, and she doesn't believe in the concept of a purely platonic close relationship that might lead to more feelings.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, trust and communication are key. The girlfriend feels hurt and betrayed, which is a valid emotional response. Even if the author didn't intend to show attraction, the action still caused distress. The question is whether the act itself was wrong, regardless of intent.\n\nIn relationships, what's considered cheating can vary. Some people might see liking a photo as a minor transgression, while others might view it as a boundary crossed. The author's actions, while not malicious, may have disregarded his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries. Even if there's no deeper intention, the impact on the relationship is significant.\n\nThe author's defense is that the like was part of their usual interaction, but if the girlfriend perceives it as a breach of trust, then it's an issue that needs addressing. The key here is whether the action was respectful of the girlfriend's feelings. Since it caused her pain, the author might be at fault for not considering her perspective more fully.\n\nSo, while the author might not have ill intent, his action did harm the relationship. Therefore, he is in the wrong because he didn't account for his girlfriend's emotional needs and boundaries.\n"
