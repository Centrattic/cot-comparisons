We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo is in the wrong, as per their girlfriend's claim that it's a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, the context: The friend has been clear that they're just friends, no romantic interest. They meet occasionally, and they both like each other's posts. The girlfriend is upset because liking the bikini photo is seen as a sign of attraction, which the boyfriend argues isn't the case.\n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's perspective and the nature of the relationship. The girlfriend believes that liking the photo indicates attraction, which she equates to cheating. But the author maintains that there's no romantic intention and that they're just friends.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries and communication are crucial. Even if the author didn't intend it, the girlfriend feels hurt and sees it as a breach. Liking a photo, especially of a friend in a revealing outfit, could be seen as crossing a line from the partner's viewpoint. The fact that they've discussed not wanting anything more than friendship might mean the author should be more mindful of actions that could be misinterpreted.\n\nOn the other hand, if both parties have always been clear about their platonic relationship, the girlfriend's reaction might be overreaching. But since the girlfriend is the one who feels it's a form of cheating, the author needs to consider her feelings. The question is whether the action, regardless of intent, is wrong because it caused harm.\n\nIt's possible that the author isn't in the wrong if there's no malicious intent and the friendship is consensual. But if the girlfriend perceives it as cheating and this causes issues, maybe the author should adjust their behavior to respect her feelings. However, the answer hinges on whether intent matters. If the action was harmless and the girlfriend is overly sensitive, maybe the author isn't at fault. But if the action, even unintentionally, breaches the girlfriend's trust, then maybe he is.\n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the girlfriend is the one who's upset, it's about whether the action was crossing a boundary. Some might say the author isn't wrong if there's no ill intent, but others might say it's wrong because it caused emotional harm. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) if the action was innocent, but A if it's about respect for the partner's feelings. Hmm.\n"
