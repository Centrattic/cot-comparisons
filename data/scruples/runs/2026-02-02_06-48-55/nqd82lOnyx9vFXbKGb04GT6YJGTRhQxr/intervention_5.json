We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author liked a photo of a female friend in a bikini on Facebook, and their girlfriend is calling that \"minor cheating.\" The author argues that they've known each other for a long time, they're just friends, and they don't have any romantic feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The girlfriend feels that liking the photo shows attraction, which the author denies. The key points here are the context of their friendship and the girlfriend's perspective. The author mentions they meet occasionally and have a platonic relationship where they've both agreed there's no romantic interest. But the girlfriend is interpreting the like as a sign of attraction or cheating.\n\nNow, in relationships, trust and communication are important. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable with her partner liking photos of other people, especially in revealing clothing, that's her boundary. But is the author violating that boundary? The author says they usually like each other's posts, not just this one. So it's part of their normal interaction. However, the girlfriend is taking it as a sign of something more, which leads to conflict.\n\nIs there a line crossed here? The author might not see the like as a big deal, but the girlfriend does. The concept of \"cheating\" can be subjective and varies between relationships. Some people might see liking a photo as just a friendly gesture, while others might feel it's inappropriate. The author's defense is that they've established the friendship is purely platonic, but actions can sometimes have unintended meanings, especially in the context of a romantic partner's insecurities.\n\nI think it's a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong if the intention was just to be friendly and there's no other context. However, if the girlfriend has specific boundaries that the author hasn't respected, then it could be their fault. The problem here is that the girlfriend is interpreting it as cheating, which may stem from her own insecurities or a different understanding of appropriate behavior in the relationship. The author should communicate with their girlfriend to understand her feelings better and perhaps adjust their actions if they're causing hurt. But if they've done nothing else and the girlfriend is taking it out of proportion, maybe it's not entirely their fault. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong, but it's a close call.\n"
