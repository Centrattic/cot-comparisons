We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who liked their friend's bikini photo is wrong, as the girlfriend called it minor cheating. The situation involves a long-time female friend they occasionally meet with, and they both agree it's just friendship. The author liked the photo, which the girlfriend interprets as a sign of attraction and cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The author sees it as a harmless like, part of mutual interactions. The girlfriend, however, feels it's crossing a boundary. The key points are the intent behind the like, the expectations in the relationship, and whether the action violates those expectations.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries can vary. What's acceptable to one person might not be to another. The author claims there's no attraction, but the girlfriend's perception is that the like shows attraction. Even if the author didn't mean it as such, if the girlfriend is hurt and feels it's a breach, then from her perspective, it's a problem.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. If the relationship had prior discussions about boundaries and the author knew not to like such photos, then they'd be in the wrong. But the scenario says there's no prior history of this being an issue. The author likes other posts as well, and the girlfriend is now bringing this up specifically. It might be more about the girlfriend's insecurities or redefining boundaries after the fact.\n\nHowever, in relationships, partners need to communicate their boundaries. If the girlfriend didn't discuss this before, the author might not be aware. But once the girlfriend brings it up, the author needs to respect that boundary moving forward. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for the past action, but might need to adjust their behavior to respect the girlfriend's feelings. \n\nBut the question is whether they are in the wrong now. Since the girlfriend is upset and the author didn't intend harm, it's a matter of perception and communication. The answer hinges on whether the action intentionally crossed a boundary. Since the author didn't know it was a boundary, maybe not. But the girlfriend's perspective is valid, so the author might need to apologize and avoid similar actions in the future. \n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, sometimes the answer is B (not an asshole) because the person didn't mean harm, but others might see it as A. However, since the girlfriend's perspective is valid and the author should consider her feelings, maybe the answer is B. But I'm a bit torn. The key is that the author isn't intentionally cheating, but the girlfriend's feelings matter. The answer might be B because the author didn't know, but the situation requires them to listen to the girlfriend's concerns.\n"
