We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by liking a bikini photo of a female friend, which his girlfriend considers minor cheating.\n\nFirst, the context: The author and the female friend have been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and have explicitly agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They often like each other's Facebook posts. The issue here is liking a specific photo where the friend is in a bikini.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that liking the photo shows attraction and is a form of cheating. The author thinks it's unfair because he and the friend are just friends.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The key points are the nature of the relationship between the author and the friend, the girlfriend's feelings, and societal norms around what's considered appropriate in a relationship.\n\nIn many relationships, partners have unspoken boundaries about interactions with others. Even if the author and the friend consider themselves just friends, the girlfriend might feel that liking a revealing photo crosses a line, especially if it's the only such photo being liked. The fact that they don't interact often (every 1.5 months) might reduce the risk of deeper feelings, but the girlfriend's perception is valid here.\n\nIt's also important to consider communication. If the girlfriend hasn't clearly expressed her boundaries before this incident, the author might not have known. However, if this is part of a pattern and the girlfriend has concerns, then the author might need to adjust his behavior to respect her feelings.\n\nThe question is whether the action was wrong. From a third-party view, it's subjective. But in relationship terms, respect for the partner's feelings is crucial. If the girlfriend feels it's cheating, then the author should probably avoid such actions to maintain trust. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because his action, while possibly innocent, caused harm to his girlfriend's feelings and trust. However, if there's no prior discussion about boundaries, it's a bit more nuanced. But generally, in relationships, actions that make the partner uncomfortable can be seen as the partner's issue, but in this case, the girlfriend's reaction is about her interpretation of the action as cheating. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering her perspective and adjusting his behavior accordingly.\n"
