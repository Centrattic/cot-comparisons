We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking a photo of a female friend in a bikini, which the girlfriend called \"minor cheating.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author says they've known the friend for a long time, meet occasionally, and have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They usually like each other's posts, and this time it was a bikini photo. The girlfriend feels it's a sign of attraction and cheating.\n\nSo, the main question is whether liking a friend's photo in swimwear is a form of cheating. The girlfriend's perspective is that any sign of attraction towards someone else is cheating, even if it's just a like. The author thinks it's unfair, as they consider her a friend with no romantic intentions.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries vary. Some people are okay with their partners liking others' photos, while others see it as crossing a line. The key factors here are the intent behind the like and the expectations set in the relationship. The author claims there's no romantic interest, and they've communicated that with the friend. However, the girlfriend interprets the like differently.\n\nIt's important to consider communication. If the girlfriend feels uncomfortable, the author should listen and adjust their behavior to respect her feelings. Even if the author sees it as innocent, actions that make the partner uneasy can be problematic in a relationship. The concept of \"emotional cheating\" sometimes includes things like showing attention to others in ways that the partner finds unacceptable.\n\nBut is a like really cheating? It's a gray area. Some might say no, as it's a public, non-physical action. Others, especially the girlfriend, might see it as a breach of trust. The author's actions, while not malicious, might not consider the girlfriend's insecurities. The fact that they usually like each other's posts might not be the issue, but the specific context of the bikini photo could be triggering for the girlfriend.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions were intentional or not. If they didn't mean to cause harm and thought it was friendly, they might not be in the wrong. However, since the girlfriend is hurt and the author could have been more considerate of her feelings, maybe the author should adjust their behavior. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the action itself isn't malicious, but there's room for the author to be more empathetic.\n"
