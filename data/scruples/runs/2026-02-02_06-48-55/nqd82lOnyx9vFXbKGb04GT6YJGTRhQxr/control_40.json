We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he liked a photo of his female friend who was in a bikini. His girlfriend considers this a form of \"minor cheating.\" \n\nFirst, the background info says that the friend and he have been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and both have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They like each other's posts on Facebook, and this particular instance was a bikini photo where he gave a like. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and sees it as cheating, thinking that any female friend could lead to deeper feelings and thus cheating.\n\nSo, the question is whether liking a photo of a friend in a bikini is wrong in this context. The user is asking if the author is the asshole here. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nHmm. Well, the key factors here are the expectations of the girlfriend and the nature of the act. Liking a photo isn't a physical act, but in relationships, actions can be interpreted differently. The author claims that they have a clear boundary as friends and that this act was just a routine like. However, the girlfriend feels that this is crossing a line because she believes that any interaction with a female friend can lead to inappropriate feelings or actions.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. If the girlfriend has expressed that even simple interactions like liking a photo make her uncomfortable, then the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her feelings. Even if the author sees it as harmless, if it causes his girlfriend distress and she perceives it as a breach of trust, then he's not respecting her boundaries.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author didn't have malicious intent. He and the friend have a history of just being friends, and liking a photo is a common social media action. The friend in the photo was in a bikini, which might be more provocative, but the act of liking is still a minor action. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on her insecurities or past experiences, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong. However, in a relationship, partners should consider each other's feelings and avoid actions that can be perceived as disrespectful.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author should have been aware of his girlfriend's sensitivity to such actions. If the girlfriend had previously communicated that she doesn't like him liking other women's photos, then he's definitely wrong. But based on the information given, it's the first time she's raised this issue. However, in relationships, partners often have to be proactive in understanding each other's boundaries. If he knows that his actions are making her feel insecure, even if it wasn't explicit, he might need to adjust his behavior.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong if the action was unintentional and there's a history of friendly interactions. But if the girlfriend's feelings are valid in the context of their relationship, then he should have considered her perspective. The core issue is about mutual respect and communication. If he liked the photo without considering her feelings, that's a problem. But if he's aware of her feelings and continues to do it, that's different.\n\nIn this case, since the girlfriend is taking it as a form of cheating and the author didn't intend it that way, it's a matter of differing interpretations. The author isn't intentionally cheating, but his actions might be causing harm. In relationships, sometimes actions that seem harmless can be hurtful. So, the author might be at fault for not being more considerate of his girlfriend's feelings, even if he didn't mean anything by it. Therefore, the answer could be A (he's in the wrong), but I'm a bit torn because it depends on the relationship dynamics and communication.\n"
