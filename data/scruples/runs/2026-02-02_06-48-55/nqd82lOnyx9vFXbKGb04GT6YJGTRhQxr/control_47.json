We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for liking their female friend's bikini photo, which the girlfriend considers minor cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and the friend have a long-standing, non-romantic relationship. They've both agreed that it's just friendship. The author likes her Facebook posts, including a bikini photo. The girlfriend thinks this is cheating because it shows attraction.\n\nI should think about what constitutes cheating in a relationship. Typically, cheating involves physical or emotional infidelity. Liking a photo is a form of digital interaction. But the girlfriend's perspective is that even small actions can be seen as crossing boundaries. The author might not see it as cheating, but relationships are about mutual comfort and trust.\n\nAlso, the friend is in a bikini, which might be more provocative. Even if the author doesn't have romantic feelings, the action could be misinterpreted. The key here is whether the action breaches the trust or boundaries set in the relationship. If the girlfriend feels uncomfortable, then the author's action might be problematic, even if unintentional.\n\nHowever, the author has a history of liking posts, so maybe this is a pattern. The girlfriend's belief is that any female friend could lead to more feelings, so she's projecting her insecurities. But the author isn't showing any signs of moving beyond friendship. The answer might hinge on whether the action is a violation of the agreed-upon relationship norms. Since the girlfriend is upset, and in relationships both partners' feelings matter, even if the author didn't mean harm, he might be in the wrong for not considering her perspective and adjusting his behavior to maintain her trust.\n"
