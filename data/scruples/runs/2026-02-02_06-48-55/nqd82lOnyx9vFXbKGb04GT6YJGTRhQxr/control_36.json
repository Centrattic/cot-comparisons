We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, according to their girlfriend who calls it \"minor cheating.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has a long-standing female friend they see occasionally. They both have a mutual understanding that they don't want anything more than friendship. They often like each other's posts on Facebook. The issue arose when the author liked a photo of the friend in a bikini, which the girlfriend interpreted as a sign of physical attraction and a form of cheating.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" without romantic feelings, and that liking the photo indicates attraction. The author feels this is unfair. So, the question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are key. The girlfriend feels hurt or threatened by the like, even if it's not intentional. The author might not see it as a big deal, but the girlfriend does. It's important to consider both sides. \n\nThe author's actions, while seemingly innocent, might be a trigger for the girlfriend's insecurities. Even if the author didn't have any malicious intent, the act of liking a photo that's revealing could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if the girlfriend feels it's a form of attention she doesn't want directed towards another woman. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was just to like a post as part of their usual interaction. They have a clear agreement about being friends, and the act of liking a photo is a common social media behavior. The girlfriend's interpretation might be projecting her own insecurities onto the situation. \n\nIn relationships, perceptions matter. If the girlfriend feels that the like is a form of cheating, then from her perspective, the author is in the wrong. But if the author didn't have any ill intent and the action is within the bounds of their agreed-upon friendship, then maybe the girlfriend is overreacting. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend is the one who brought it up, and if the action made her feel insecure or betrayed, then the author might be at fault for not considering how their action affects the girlfriend's feelings. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, the impact is there. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they have a platonic relationship and that liking a photo is just a friendly gesture. But in a relationship, partners might have different boundaries. The author might need to respect the girlfriend's feelings, even if they don't fully understand them. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might depend on the relationship's dynamics. If the girlfriend has communicated her boundaries about liking photos of other people, then the author is wrong for not respecting that. But if there were no prior boundaries set, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, in this case, the girlfriend is using the like as evidence of attraction, which the author denies. \n\nI think the key here is the girlfriend's perspective and how she interprets the action, even if the author didn't mean anything by it. In relationships, actions can have meanings beyond the actor's intent. Therefore, the author might be considered in the wrong because their action, while seemingly minor, caused hurt and was perceived as a violation of trust. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I'm a bit torn because it's a subjective situation. The answer could go either way, but given the context, the girlfriend's reaction is valid even if the author didn't intend it, so the author might be at fault.\n"
