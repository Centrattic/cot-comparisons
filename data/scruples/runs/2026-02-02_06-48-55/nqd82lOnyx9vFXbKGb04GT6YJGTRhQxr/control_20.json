We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their friend's bikini photo is in the wrong, given that their girlfriend considers it a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend in question is a long-time friend, and they've both stated they don't want anything more than friendship. They meet occasionally and have a platonic relationship. The issue here is liking a photo where the friend is in a bikini. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and physical interest, which leads her to call it \"minor cheating.\"\n\nNow, I should think about the dynamics of relationships. In many relationships, partners have boundaries about what's acceptable regarding physical contact or expressions of attraction towards others. Liking a photo can be a form of engagement, but depending on the context, it might be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the intention is innocent, the girlfriend feels hurt and believes it signifies a lack of commitment to the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are mutual understanding and communication. The author and his friend have established that they don't want anything more than friendship. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that any form of attention towards another person, especially in a revealing photo, could be a breach of trust. It's possible that the girlfriend feels insecure or that the boundaries aren't respected.\n\nBut is the act of liking the photo inherently wrong? The author's intention is to be a good friend and engage in normal social media interactions. However, in the context of a relationship, what's considered normal can vary. The girlfriend's perception is that it's crossing a line, which matters because trust and comfort are crucial in a relationship. Even if the author doesn't see it as cheating, the girlfriend's feelings shouldn't be dismissed.\n\nAnother angle is that the author might not have considered how this action affects his girlfriend. If he's aware she's uncomfortable with it, continuing the behavior without addressing her feelings could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that they met once every 1.5 months and have a platonic relationship doesn't negate the girlfriend's feelings if she interprets the like as a sign of attraction.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author may not have malicious intent, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The act of liking the photo, though innocent in intent, could be seen as crossing a boundary in their relationship. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his girlfriend's boundaries and perceptions, even if unintentionally.\n"
