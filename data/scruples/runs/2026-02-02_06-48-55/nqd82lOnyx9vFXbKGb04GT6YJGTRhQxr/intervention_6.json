We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who liked the friend's bikini photo is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: the author has a long-time female friend. They meet occasionally, and there's no romantic interest from either side. They usually like each other's Facebook posts. The girlfriend is upset because liking a bikini photo is considered \"minor cheating\" by her. The author thinks it's unfair and isn't in the wrong.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations in the relationship and the girlfriend's perspective. The girlfriend believes that liking the photo implies attraction and is a form of cheating. Even though the author and friend have a platonic relationship, the girlfriend's jealousy is causing conflict.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, communication is key. If the girlfriend feels that this action is a boundary that shouldn't be crossed, then the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her feelings. Even if the author doesn't see the like as a big deal, the girlfriend's perspective is valid and needs to be addressed.\n\nBut wait, the author and friend do like each other's posts regularly. The girlfriend's argument is that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" and that one will eventually develop stronger feelings. This might be a general insecurity or past experiences influencing her.\n\nHowever, the act of liking a photo, especially a bikini one, can be seen as crossing a line, even if the intention was innocent. The girlfriend's reaction is about how the action makes her feel, not just the action itself. In relationships, partners' comfort levels matter, and if this action caused her distress, the author should consider her feelings.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't intend to harm, the girlfriend's perspective is valid. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings and continuing the action despite her objection.\n"
