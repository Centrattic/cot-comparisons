We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who liked their friend's photo is in the wrong. The situation is that they have a female friend they've known a long time, they meet occasionally, and they both agree they don't want anything more than friendship. The friend posted a bikini photo while on a trip, and the author liked it. The girlfriend is upset, calling it \"minor cheating.\" The girlfriend's perspective is that liking the photo shows attraction and leads to cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author claims a platonic friendship with clear boundaries. They both stated they don't want more than that. Liking a photo on social media is a common action, even among friends. The girlfriend is interpreting the like as a sign of attraction. But does a like inherently mean attraction, or is that a projection? \n\nIn many relationships, especially where there's jealousy or insecurity, actions can be misinterpreted. The author didn't engage in anything beyond a like, which is a passive action. The friend's post was public, and liking a photo doesn't equate to having romantic feelings. However, the girlfriend's perception is that this crosses a line she expects from her partner. \n\nThe key here is mutual understanding. If both parties had agreed that liking photos is acceptable, then maybe there's no issue. But the problem arises because the girlfriend feels it's a violation. The author might not see it as a problem, but the girlfriend does. The question is about whether the author is wrong for liking it. \n\nCheating typically involves a breach of trust or exclusivity in the relationship. Since the author isn't engaging in any physical or emotional intimacy with the friend, just a like might not constitute cheating. However, if the girlfriend's boundaries are that strict, then maybe the author should have been more cautious. But is it the author's fault if the girlfriend interprets it that way? \n\nAlternatively, maybe the girlfriend is being overly possessive or insecure. The author has a right to engage with friends on social media. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable with such interactions, the author should communicate and set boundaries, but the action itself isn't inherently wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for liking the photo, given the context of the friendship and the nature of the action. The girlfriend's reaction stems from her personal feelings rather than the author's actions being objectively wrong.\n"
