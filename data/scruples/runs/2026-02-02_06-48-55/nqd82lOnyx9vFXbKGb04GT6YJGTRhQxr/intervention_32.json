We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who liked their friend's bikini photo was in the wrong, according to their girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, the context: The author has a long-term female friend they see occasionally. They've both agreed they don't want anything romantic. The author liked a photo of her in a bikini on Facebook. The girlfriend considers this a form of cheating.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's point of view, she feels that liking such a photo is a sign of attraction and thus a betrayal. Even though the author and the friend are just friends, the act of liking the photo might be seen as engaging in something flirtatious or inappropriate in the context of the relationship. The girlfriend's belief is that any interaction with a member of the opposite sex that shows attraction could lead to more feelings, hence cheating.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that it's just a friendly like, part of their usual interaction. They clarify there's no attraction, and they maintain a platonic relationship. But the key here is that the girlfriend feels hurt and betrayed. In relationships, trust and boundaries are important. The girlfriend might feel that even a like can send signals or be a start to something more, which she's not comfortable with.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend perceives the action as cheating, and the relationship's boundaries are that such actions are not allowed, then the author might not be respecting those boundaries. Even if the author didn't intend to, the action crossed the girlfriend's line, which is significant in a relationship. So, from that perspective, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the impact of their action on their partner's feelings and the agreed-upon boundaries.\n\nHowever, if there was no prior discussion about social media interactions and what's acceptable, then maybe the girlfriend's reaction is a new boundary being introduced. But since the girlfriend feels it's cheating, the author's action, regardless of intent, might still be problematic because it violates the girlfriend's trust and expectations. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect the girlfriend's feelings and the boundaries she has in place.\n"
