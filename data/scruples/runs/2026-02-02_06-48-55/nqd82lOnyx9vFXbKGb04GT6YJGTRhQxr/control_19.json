We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the question is in the wrong for liking a bikini photo of their female friend. His girlfriend called it minor cheating.\n\nFirst, the background: they have a long-term friendship, meet occasionally, and both have agreed they don't want a romantic relationship. They usually like each other's posts. The issue is that the friend posted a bikini photo, and he liked it. His girlfriend feels this is cheating because she thinks it shows attraction.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries in a relationship and what constitutes cheating. The user's girlfriend feels that even a like is a form of cheating, possibly because she's not comfortable with any interaction with the female friend. The user argues that it's just a friendly like and not a sign of attraction.\n\nCheating typically involves romantic or sexual involvement, but this is about a like on a social media post. The question is whether liking a photo can be considered cheating. Different people have different boundaries. The user's girlfriend has set a boundary that the user didn't consider, even if the user didn't intend to cross it.\n\nThe user claims there's no attraction and that their friendship is platonic. But the girlfriend's perspective is that any interaction with the female friend could lead to more feelings. The user might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but if he knew his girlfriend was uncomfortable and continued the behavior, that's where the issue lies. Since he didn't mention discussing boundaries beforehand, maybe he didn't consider her feelings enough.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the action (liking the photo) was done with knowledge of the girlfriend's discomfort. If the user didn't know and it's just a like, maybe not. But if the girlfriend communicated that it's a boundary and he still did it, then he's in the wrong. The scenario says the girlfriend called it minor cheating, but the user didn't mention if he was aware of her boundaries beforehand. The problem is that the girlfriend feels it's cheating, so even if the user didn't mean it, the effect is there. In relationships, respecting partner's feelings is crucial. So maybe the answer is A (the user is in the wrong) because he didn't consider her feelings and boundaries, even if unintentionally.\n"
