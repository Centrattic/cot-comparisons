We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author liked a photo of their female friend in a bikini. The girlfriend interprets this as a form of cheating. The key points here are the nature of the relationship between the author and the friend, the context of the like, and the girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, the author and the friend are described as having a long-standing, purely platonic friendship. They meet occasionally and engage in typical friend activities. They've both clarified that they don't want anything more than friendship. The author likes other posts too, not just the bikini photo. The girlfriend, however, feels that liking a bikini photo, even of a friend, is a sign of attraction and thus cheating.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's argument is that it's just a friendly interaction, a simple like, and that the context supports a platonic relationship. The girlfriend's perspective is that any expression of physical attraction towards someone else is cheating, regardless of the relationship. \n\nIn many relationships, boundaries and what's considered acceptable can vary. Some people might see a like as harmless, others might feel it's crossing a line. The author didn't have malicious intent, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The issue here might be more about communication and differing expectations. The author might not be aware of how their actions are perceived, especially if they don't have a history of jealousy in this area. However, if the couple hasn't discussed what behaviors are considered appropriate regarding friends of the opposite sex, the author's action could still be a misstep. \n\nCheating typically involves a violation of agreed-upon boundaries in a relationship. If the couple hasn't explicitly talked about what constitutes cheating, it's hard to say definitively. But since the girlfriend feels it's cheating, and the author's action was in a context that could be seen as flirtatious (even if unintended), the author might be at fault for not considering their partner's feelings. \n\nHowever, the author's intention was likely innocent. The problem here is more about differing views on what's acceptable. So, the answer could hinge on whether the action itself (a like) is inherently wrong or if it's the girlfriend's interpretation that's the issue. Since the girlfriend's definition of cheating includes such actions, the author might be in the wrong because their action caused harm to the relationship, even if unintentionally. On the other hand, if the couple hasn't set clear boundaries, the author might not be entirely at fault. But given that the girlfriend is making this a big deal and the author's action was a direct trigger, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation where communication is key.\n"
