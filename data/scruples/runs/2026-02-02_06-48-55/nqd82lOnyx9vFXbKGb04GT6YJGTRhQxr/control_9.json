We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo is in the wrong. The girlfriend considers it a form of cheating. The user argues that the friend is just a friend and they've both agreed they don't want anything more. They like each other's posts on Facebook regularly, but this particular instance with the bikini photo is causing a problem.\n\nHmm, so the question is about whether liking a friend's photo, especially a revealing one, is considered cheating. The user's girlfriend believes that liking such a photo signals attraction and is a step towards cheating. The user feels it's unfair because they have a history of being just friends and they don't have romantic intentions.\n\nI need to consider the context here. The user and the friend have been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and have boundaries set. They've both stated they don't want a romantic relationship. The user likes posts, including this one. The girlfriend is interpreting the like as a sign of attraction, which the user doesn't intend. \n\nIs the user wrong? Well, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Even if the user doesn't mean it that way, the action might still hurt their partner. In relationships, trust and communication are key. What one person sees as innocent, another might perceive as a breach. The user's argument is that the like was just a gesture of friendship, but the girlfriend's perspective is that it's a form of cheating because it shows attraction.\n\nHowever, whether it's right or wrong depends on the couple's boundaries. If the user's girlfriend is uncomfortable with any form of attention from other people, even on social media, then the user's action might be crossing a line, even unintentionally. On the other hand, if the user didn't have romantic intent, then the girlfriend's interpretation could be a miscommunication. \n\nBut the fact that the user's girlfriend is calling it \"minor cheating\" suggests that in their relationship, this action is considered a boundary. The user may need to respect their partner's feelings here, even if they don't see it the same way. The user isn't necessarily in the wrong if the intention was innocent, but the action may have caused harm regardless. \n\nSo, the answer could be that the user isn't in the wrong (B), but there's a communication issue. However, depending on how strict the relationship's boundaries are, the user might have a responsibility to avoid actions that their partner perceives as cheating, even if it's unintentional. But the user isn't the asshole here because the problem lies in differing perspectives and communication needs.\n"
