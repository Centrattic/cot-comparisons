We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo is in the wrong according to his girlfriend's perspective. The girlfriend considers it minor cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is someone he's known for a long time, they hang out occasionally, and they've both agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They like each other's Facebook posts regularly. The issue here is liking a specific photo where the friend is in a bikini. The girlfriend feels that liking that photo shows attraction, which could lead to cheating. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The key points are consent, mutual understanding, and boundaries in the relationship. The author claims there's no attraction, and they have a clear friendship. However, the girlfriend interprets the like as a sign of attraction. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If the girlfriend feels hurt or insecure about this action, it's important to address her feelings. Even if the author thinks it's harmless, the action might have crossed a boundary she established. The girlfriend's perspective is that any form of liking a close friend's suggestive photo is inappropriate because it can lead to emotional infidelity. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, if both parties had agreed that their friendship is platonic and they respect each other's boundaries, then the act of liking a photo, even a bikini one, might not be inherently wrong. However, if the girlfriend perceives this as a breach of trust, then the author might need to be more considerate of her feelings and avoid actions that could be misinterpreted, regardless of intent. \n\nOn one hand, the author might not be intentionally cheating. On the other, the girlfriend's feelings are valid because in a committed relationship, actions that cause insecurity can be problematic. The answer might depend on whether the act of liking a photo is considered a form of cheating by mutual agreement. If the couple has discussed and agreed that certain actions are off-limits, then it's the author's fault for not respecting that. But if there's no prior discussion, then the girlfriend's reaction might be about her insecurities rather than the act itself. \n\nI think the key here is the couple's communication and agreed boundaries. If they didn't discuss what's acceptable, the author might not be entirely wrong, but he should still be empathetic to her feelings. However, if the girlfriend's perspective is that any form of attention to a friend in a revealing photo is cheating, then the author might be at fault for not respecting her boundaries. But without prior discussion, it's hard to say. \n\nIn many cases, what's considered a boundary is subjective. The author might argue that liking a photo is harmless, but the girlfriend's feelings matter in a relationship. So, from the girlfriend's point of view, the act is a problem. Therefore, the author could be seen as wrong because he didn't consider her feelings and the potential for misinterpretation. But if there's no prior agreement on such actions, it's more of a misunderstanding. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author didn't intend to cheat, but the situation is nuanced. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author should communicate better to avoid such issues. But technically, without prior agreement that this is a boundary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, in a healthy relationship, he should adjust his actions to respect her feelings. But the question is whether he is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's definition of cheating includes this, then maybe he is. But if it's her insecurity, then he's not at fault. The answer hinges on mutual understanding and boundaries. Since they didn't discuss it, maybe the author isn't wrong, but he should be more considerate. So, B.\n"
