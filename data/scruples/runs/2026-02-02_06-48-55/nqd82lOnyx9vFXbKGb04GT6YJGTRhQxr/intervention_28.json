We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for liking their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook. The girlfriend is calling it a form of cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions they've been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and both have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They like each other's posts regularly, and this was just one instance of liking a photo.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that liking the photo shows attraction and is a breach of trust. She believes that any level of liking a female friend's photos is a step towards cheating. The author thinks it's unfair because they have a clear understanding of their friendship and no romantic feelings.\n\nNow, I need to evaluate if liking a bikini photo is indeed a form of cheating. Cheating typically involves emotional or physical infidelity. In some relationships, boundaries are set to avoid any actions that might be perceived as flirtatious or showing attraction to others. Liking a bikini photo could be seen as a subtle form of attention that might make the partner uncomfortable, even if it's not intentional.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual understanding. The author and his friend have communicated their boundaries. However, the partner's feelings are valid, and trust is essential in a relationship. Even if the author didn't intend it, the action caused hurt. The question is whether the action crossed a line that both partners had agreed not to cross.\n\nIn some relationships, partners agree not to engage in certain behaviors with others, even if they're just friends. If the couple had discussed and agreed that liking photos of other people is acceptable, then maybe the girlfriend overreacted. But if the girlfriend feels that it's a boundary that shouldn't be crossed, then the author might have violated that boundary.\n\nThe author's intent is important. If he didn't have romantic feelings and was just being friendly, but the partner still feels hurt, it's a communication issue. The author might need to be more considerate of his partner's feelings, even if he doesn't see the action as problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend is setting boundaries that are reasonable and the author is aware but still chooses to like the photo, that's a problem. However, if the author wasn't aware of the specific boundaries, then maybe the issue is about communication rather than the author being in the wrong.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the agreed-upon boundaries. If the couple had a mutual understanding that such actions are not allowed, then yes. If not, maybe not. The girlfriend's perspective is that any like shows attraction, which the author might not agree with. The author's argument is that it's just a friendly like. But in relationships, actions that make a partner feel insecure can be problematic. Even if the author didn't mean it as a show of attraction, the partner's perception matters. \n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider his partner's feelings and the potential for that action to be perceived as crossing a boundary they had. Even if it's just a like, in a relationship where the partner is sensitive to such things, it's better to avoid actions that could be misinterpreted. So the answer might be A, but I'm a bit torn because it's about perception and communication.\n"
