We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author liked a photo of their female friend in a bikini on Facebook, and their girlfriend called it \"minor cheating.\" The friend is someone they've known a long time, have a platonic relationship with, and have explicitly stated there's no romantic interest.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and the friend are just friends, and they've both agreed on that. They meet occasionally and do normal friend things. Liking Facebook posts is a common thing friends do. The issue here is the girlfriend interpreting the like on a bikini photo as a sign of attraction or cheating.\n\nThe girlfriend's point of view is that there's no such thing as a female friend without romantic feelings eventually developing, leading to cheating. The author feels this is unfair. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust and communication are key. The author didn't have any intention of showing attraction; it was a casual like. However, the girlfriend is upset because she perceives it as a breach of trust. Even if the author's intention was innocent, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. In relationships, actions that make a partner uncomfortable can be problematic if not addressed. The fact that they both agreed the relationship was purely platonic means the author didn't cross any boundaries intentionally. But the girlfriend's perspective is that the action still implies attraction. \n\nIt's possible that the girlfriend is feeling insecure or there's an unspoken rule in their relationship about interacting with friends of the opposite sex. The author might need to consider how their actions are perceived and whether there's a need for more communication about boundaries. However, the act itself\u2014liking a photo\u2014doesn't inherently indicate cheating, especially if both parties are clear about their non-romantic intentions.\n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the author's action was innocent, but the girlfriend's emotional reaction is valid. The author might not be at fault for the action itself, but maybe there's a need for more discussion about what's acceptable in the relationship. The key here is whether the action was a violation of trust or boundaries. Since the author didn't have romantic intent and both had clarified their relationship, it's more about the girlfriend's interpretation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for the action, but the situation highlights a need for better communication between the couple.\n"
