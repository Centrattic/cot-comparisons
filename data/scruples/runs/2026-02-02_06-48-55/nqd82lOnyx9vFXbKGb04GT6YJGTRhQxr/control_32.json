We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who liked their friend's bikini photo is wrong, as his girlfriend called it minor cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is female, and they've known each other for a long time. They meet occasionally and are clear about being just friends. The friend posted a bikini photo while traveling, and the author liked it. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction, leading to accusations of cheating.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the relationship between the author and the friend. They've both agreed they want nothing more than friendship. The like on a photo is a common social media interaction. The girlfriend's perspective is that any form of liking a friend's photo, especially one in a bikini, implies attraction. But the author argues it's just friendly interaction.\n\nI should think about social media norms. Liking photos is standard, and unless there's a specific boundary set by the girlfriend about what's acceptable, it's hard to see how a like is cheating. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid; she might feel insecure or see it as a breach of trust. The author might need to consider her feelings and whether the like could be misinterpreted, even if unintentionally.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If there's no prior agreement to avoid liking photos, especially from a close friend, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. The issue might stem from the girlfriend's personal boundaries and perceptions rather than the action itself. The author's intent was just to be friendly, and as long as there's no malicious intent or ongoing pattern of behavior, it's a misunderstanding rather than a wrongdoing.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but they should communicate with their girlfriend to address her concerns and maybe set clearer boundaries to prevent future issues.\n"
