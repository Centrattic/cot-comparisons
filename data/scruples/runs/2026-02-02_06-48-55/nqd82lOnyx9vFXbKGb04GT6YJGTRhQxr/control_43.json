We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for liking a bikini photo of a female friend, and the girlfriend considers it cheating. The author claims they're just friends with no romantic feelings. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She feels that liking the photo shows attraction, which is a form of cheating. Relationships often have boundaries, and if the girlfriend set a rule that liking such photos is unacceptable, then the author might be violating that boundary. Even if the author doesn't have feelings, the action upset their partner, which is important.\n\nBut the author argues that they've been friends for a long time, met occasionally, and both agreed they don't want more. They also like each other's posts regularly. The girlfriend's belief that \"female friends\" inevitably lead to more feelings might be her insecurity or past experiences, but that doesn't make the author wrong per se. However, in a relationship, respecting your partner's feelings and boundaries is crucial. If the author knew this could be a problem, liking the photo could be seen as dismissive of their partner's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't have malicious intent. They might not see the like as romantic. But relationships require communication and mutual respect. If the girlfriend is hurt and sees it as cheating, the author should take her feelings seriously, even if they don't agree. So while the author might not be \"wrong\" objectively, they are in the wrong by not considering their partner's perspective and violating a boundary she set. Hence, answer A.\n"
