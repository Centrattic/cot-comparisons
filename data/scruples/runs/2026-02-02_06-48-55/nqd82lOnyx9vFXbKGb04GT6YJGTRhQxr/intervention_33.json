We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author did something wrong by liking their female friend's bikini photo, and their girlfriend called it \"minor cheating.\" The author says they've been friends for a long time, they meet occasionally, and they've both agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They like each other's posts normally, and this time, the author liked a photo of the friend in a bikini. The girlfriend is upset because she thinks it shows attraction and is a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship dynamics. The author and the friend are clear about being just friends. But the girlfriend's perspective is that any form of positive interaction, especially liking a revealing photo, is a red flag. The key here is about boundaries in a relationship. The author might not see the like as a big deal, but the girlfriend does. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, it depends on what the couple's agreed-upon boundaries are. If they have a mutual understanding about what's acceptable, then the author might have crossed a line, even unintentionally. But if there's no prior discussion about social media interactions, maybe the girlfriend is overreacting. However, in relationships, feelings and perceptions matter. Even if the author didn't intend to make the girlfriend jealous, the action did cause distress. \n\nOn one hand, liking a friend's photo is a common social media action. On the other hand, in a committed relationship, sometimes certain actions, especially involving exes or very close friends, can be sensitive. The friend in question is described as a platonic friend, but the girlfriend's interpretation is that it's a sign of attraction. The author might not realize how this action affects their partner. \n\nI think the main issue here is communication. The author didn't consider how the girlfriend might perceive the like, and the girlfriend feels her boundaries are not respected. Even if the author meant no harm, not acknowledging the girlfriend's feelings could be seen as dismissive. So, maybe the author is partially at fault for not being more considerate of the girlfriend's perspective. But also, the girlfriend's view that it's a form of cheating might be a bit extreme unless there was a specific agreement against liking friends' photos. \n\nIn summary, while the act itself is minor, the impact on the relationship is significant. The author might not be the asshole, but they could have handled it better by being more aware of their partner's feelings. However, it's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on the couple's specific norms and how they communicate about such things.\n"
