We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking a photo of a female friend in a bikini, which the girlfriend called \"minor cheating.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and the female friend are described as having a long-standing, purely platonic relationship. They meet occasionally, do normal friend activities, and have explicitly stated they don't want anything more. The author likes her Facebook posts, including this bikini photo. The girlfriend interprets this like as a sign of attraction and cheating.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries in relationships and what constitutes cheating. Cheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity. Liking a photo is a minor action, but the girlfriend feels hurt because she perceives it as a sign of attraction. However, the author maintains that their relationship with the friend is purely platonic and they've communicated that.\n\nThe question is whether the action (liking the photo) is wrong. From a strict cheating standpoint, liking a photo isn't infidelity. But relationships often have unspoken boundaries. If the girlfriend feels uncomfortable with this interaction, even if it's not overtly inappropriate, maybe the author should consider her feelings.\n\nBut the author isn't doing anything more than liking a photo, which is a common social media interaction. The friend isn't doing anything inappropriate either. The girlfriend's perspective is that any show of attraction, even a like, is a form of cheating. That seems extreme, but it's her feeling. The author might not be in the wrong, but they could still be insensitive if they don't address their partner's concerns.\n\nHowever, the author hasn't done anything beyond what's considered normal. The friend's photo is public, and liking it is a standard reaction. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity or a different understanding of boundaries. The author isn't violating any explicit agreement they have with the friend, and they've communicated their intentions clearly.\n\nIn conclusion, while the girlfriend's feelings are valid, the act of liking a photo isn't inherently cheating. The author isn't in the wrong, but they might need to communicate better with their partner to address her insecurities.\n"
