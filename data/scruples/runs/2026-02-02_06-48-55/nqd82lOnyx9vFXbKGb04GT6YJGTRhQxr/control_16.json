We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked a female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, as his girlfriend considers it a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend is someone he knows well, they meet occasionally, and they've both agreed that their relationship is just friendship with no romantic or physical intentions. They often like each other's posts, which is common on social media. The issue arises specifically with liking a bikini photo, which his girlfriend interprets as a sign of attraction and cheating.\n\nThe question is whether this action crosses a boundary. The key points here are the definitions of cheating and what constitutes emotional infidelity. In many relationships, emotional cheating can involve actions that show interest in someone else in a way that could lead to a romantic relationship. However, liking a photo is a public action and might not be intentional to flirt, especially if the friends have a history of mutual likes.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that any affectionate action towards a friend of the opposite sex could be a step towards infidelity. But the user argues that they're just friends and have no romantic intentions. The challenge here is whether a simple like, in the context of their established friendship, is enough to be considered cheating.\n\nI need to consider cultural and personal boundaries. Some people might find a like innocuous, while others, especially in a trusting relationship, might be more sensitive. The fact that the couple is discussing this suggests that communication is a key factor. If the girlfriend feels hurt, the user should acknowledge her feelings, even if he doesn't see it the same way.\n\nHowever, the user didn't have any prior indication that liking photos was off-limits. They both have a history of mutual likes, so it's part of their normal interaction. Unless there's a specific agreement in the relationship about not liking certain photos, the action might not be inherently wrong. But the girlfriend's perception is valid too; if she feels it's a breach of trust, that's a relationship issue that needs addressing.\n\nSo, whether the user is in the wrong depends on the agreed-upon boundaries in their relationship. If there's no prior agreement against such actions, then he might not be in the wrong. But he should still discuss it with his girlfriend to understand her perspective and find a compromise. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that communication is essential.\n"
