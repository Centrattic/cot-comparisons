We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author has a female friend they've known for a long time. They meet occasionally, maybe once every 1.5 months. They're good friends, and both have clearly stated they don't want anything more than friendship. The friend posted a bikini photo on Facebook, and the author liked it. The girlfriend thinks this is a form of cheating, calling it \"minor cheating.\" The author is confused because they don't see it that way, but they want to know if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author and their friend have been clear about their boundaries\u2014no romantic or sexual interest. They interact as friends, doing normal friend activities. The author likes other posts from this friend as well, not just the bikini photo. The girlfriend's perspective is that liking a bikini photo shows attraction, which could lead to infidelity. The author feels this is unfair, but the girlfriend believes there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" without deeper feelings.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a general standpoint, liking a photo might seem harmless. However, in the context of a relationship, actions can be interpreted differently. The key here is the girlfriend's feelings. Even if the author didn't intend to show attraction, the act of liking a bikini photo might be seen as crossing a boundary. The girlfriend's interpretation is that it's a form of cheating, and in relationships, trust and perceived actions matter. The author's actions might not be malicious, but if they cause distress, it's worth considering if they're contributing to the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that they have a clear boundary and that liking a photo is just a friendly gesture. But in some relationships, certain actions are considered off-limits because they can be misinterpreted or make the partner uncomfortable. The girlfriend's belief that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" might be a personal insecurity or past experiences influencing her perception. However, the author's responsibility is to acknowledge and respect their partner's feelings even if they don't agree with the reasoning.\n\nSo, the author's action might not be inherently wrong, but the problem arises from the girlfriend's perspective and the author's failure to consider how their action affects her. Even if the author doesn't see it as cheating, their action caused hurt and distrust. In relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed this with their girlfriend beforehand to avoid misunderstandings. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not addressing the potential for misinterpretation and not respecting their partner's feelings in this situation.\n"
