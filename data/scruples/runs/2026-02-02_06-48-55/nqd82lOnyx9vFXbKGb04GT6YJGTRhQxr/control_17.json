We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for liking their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook, as per their girlfriend's claim of it being a form of cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The author and the friend have been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and have explicitly stated they don't want anything more than friendship. They often like each other's posts, which seems like a normal social interaction on social media.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that liking a bikini photo shows attraction and is a form of emotional cheating. But from the author's side, the action was a casual like without romantic intent. They emphasize that they've never had feelings for the friend and their relationship is platonic.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the dynamics of their relationship. If the girlfriend feels that the like crosses a boundary, even if unintended, it might be an issue of trust and communication. However, the act of liking a photo itself isn't inherently cheating. It's more about how the girlfriend perceives it and whether the author acknowledged her feelings.\n\nThe key points are mutual agreement on the friendship's boundaries and whether the author was respectful of those. Since the author didn't have romantic intentions and the friend is aware of the boundaries, the author might not be in the wrong. But if the girlfriend feels hurt and the author dismissed her feelings, that could be a problem. The main issue here is about perception and communication rather than the action itself.\n"
