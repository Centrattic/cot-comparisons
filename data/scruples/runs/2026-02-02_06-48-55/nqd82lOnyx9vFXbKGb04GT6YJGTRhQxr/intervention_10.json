We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for liking their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook, and their girlfriend considers it as cheating. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: the author and the female friend are close but platonic. They've been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and have clarified they don't want anything more than friendship. The issue arises when the author likes a photo of the friend in a bikini, which the girlfriend interprets as a sign of attraction and thus a form of cheating.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries in relationships and how different people perceive actions. The author's girlfriend believes that any form of attention given to a female friend is a problem, even if the author and the friend consider it innocent. The author, on the other hand, sees it as a normal interaction between friends.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The girlfriend's perspective is that liking the photo could be seen as showing attraction, even if it's not the author's intention. She might feel insecure or think that such actions cross a line. On the other hand, the author didn't have any ill intentions and the friend is aware of the boundaries.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, intentions matter, but so does the impact on the partner. Even if the author didn't mean to cross a boundary, if the action causes distress to the partner, then it's worth considering. However, the situation is nuanced. The author's action was a like on a photo, which is relatively passive. But in some contexts, especially where there's a history of jealousy or insecurity, even small actions can be problematic.\n\nThe challenge here is whether the author should have been more aware of their partner's feelings. If the girlfriend has communicated that certain actions are a deal-breaker, then the author might be expected to avoid those actions. However, if this is the first time this has come up and the author wasn't aware of the partner's sensitivity, it's a different scenario.\n\nAlso, the concept of \"female friends\" and the girlfriend's belief that such relationships inevitably lead to romantic feelings complicates things. The author's argument that they don't have feelings for the friend might be valid, but the girlfriend's perception is that the action is a step towards a more intimate relationship.\n\nIn terms of relationship norms, different people have different boundaries. Some might find a like on a photo harmless, while others might see it as a breach. The question is whether the author should adjust their behavior to respect their partner's boundaries even if they don't agree with them.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the mutual understanding in their relationship. If the partner has clearly set boundaries that the author is aware of, then not respecting them could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if this is a new issue without prior discussion, the author might not be fully at fault. The situation is complex, and the answer might lean on whether the author should have anticipated this reaction or if the partner is overstepping by defining a like as cheating without clear prior communication.\n"
