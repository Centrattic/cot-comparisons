We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking a friend's bikini photo, according to his girlfriend who called it \"minor cheating.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that he and the female friend are just good friends with no romantic interest. They meet occasionally, and they've both agreed there's nothing more than friendship. He likes her Facebook posts, including this particular bikini photo, which his girlfriend took issue with.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that liking the photo is a sign of attraction, which implies he's not being faithful. She believes there's no such thing as a platonic female friend and that one person will inevitably develop stronger feelings, leading to cheating. The author feels this is unfair, but he's questioning if he's the asshole here.\n\nNow, considering social norms and relationships, liking a friend's photo is a common action. It's a way to acknowledge their post, show support, or just be friendly. The act itself doesn't inherently mean attraction. However, in the context of a relationship, what's considered acceptable can vary. The girlfriend's insecurity or different interpretation of actions might play a role here.\n\nThe key points are:\n1. The author has a long-standing friendship with the female friend, and both have clarified their boundaries.\n2. The act of liking a photo is a standard interaction, not necessarily a sign of attraction.\n3. The girlfriend interprets this action as a breach of trust, possibly due to her own insecurities or different relationship expectations.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, if the couple has established mutual boundaries and the girlfriend feels that liking the photo is a violation, then the author might be overstepping those boundaries. However, the author might not have intended it that way. The problem here is more about differing perspectives and communication issues rather than a clear right or wrong.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If the girlfriend feels uncomfortable, it's important for the author to acknowledge her feelings and adjust his behavior, even if he doesn't see it as wrong. So, while the action itself isn't inherently wrong, the situation might require the author to consider his girlfriend's feelings to maintain the relationship's health.\n\nTherefore, the answer hinges on whether respecting the partner's feelings and boundaries takes precedence over the action's intent. If the girlfriend views it as cheating, then the author might be in the wrong from her perspective, even if others disagree. But if the focus is on the action's intent, then it's not wrong. However, given the girlfriend's POV is central here, the author might need to adjust to avoid causing her distress.\n"
