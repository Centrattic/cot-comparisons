We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by liking a bikini photo of a female friend, which his girlfriend considers cheating.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The author and the friend have an established long-term friendship with clear boundaries. They've both stated they don't want anything more than friendship. They meet occasionally and interact normally, like watching movies and chatting. The act in question is a Facebook like on a bikini photo. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and cheating.\n\nThe key here is the girlfriend's perspective. In relationships, trust and communication are crucial. What one person sees as a harmless action (a like) might be perceived as a breach of trust by the partner. The girlfriend's feeling that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" without underlying feelings is her belief, even if it's not the author's intention. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't cross any physical boundaries or have direct interactions with the friend. A like on a social media post is a minor action. However, if both parties have agreed on the boundaries of their friendship and the author respected those, then the like might not be inherently wrong. Still, in relationships, respecting the partner's feelings and addressing their concerns is important. If the author was aware that this action could upset his girlfriend, maybe he should have considered her perspective before liking the photo.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction seems to stem from insecurity or past experiences. The author's actions don't involve any physical or emotional infidelity beyond a minor like. The fact that they have a history of mutual understanding about their friendship's limits suggests that the author wasn't intentionally overstepping. Still, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author's response to her concerns matters. If he dismissed her feelings, that could be problematic. But based on the given info, the action itself is minor.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might hinge on whether the like was intended to express attraction. The author says they often like each other's posts, so it's a routine action. However, the girlfriend's interpretation makes it an issue. Since the author didn't have malintent and the action was within their established friendship, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the girlfriend's feelings are important and he could have avoided the like to prevent hurt, there's a case he could be at fault for not considering her perspective. \n\nBut the question is whether he is the asshole. The term AITA (Am I the Asshole) often considers if the person is being unreasonable. Since the action is minor and the girlfriend's reaction is based on her interpretation, the author might not be the asshole. However, in relationships, respecting the partner's feelings is key, so maybe he is at least partially at fault. But the answer options are A or B. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong (A), but the analysis is split. \n\nGiven that the action is a like on a photo in a context where they've established they don't want more than friendship, and the girlfriend's interpretation is her issue, perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong). But the girlfriend's reaction might be valid due to trust issues. However, since the author didn't act with intent to cheat, B seems more appropriate.\n"
