We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, as their girlfriend considers it minor cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the friend has been known for a long time, they meet occasionally, they've both agreed it's just a friendship with no romantic intentions. The issue is the like on a bikini photo. The girlfriend feels that liking such a photo shows attraction and is a form of cheating.\n\nSo, the question is whether liking a photo of a friend in a bikini crosses a boundary in the relationship. The author argues it's just a friendly action, but the girlfriend interprets it differently. \n\nIn relationships, what's considered acceptable often depends on the couple's own boundaries. If the girlfriend feels hurt or that the like is a breach of trust, then from her perspective, it might be seen as wrong. On the other hand, the author didn't have any intention beyond friendship, and the action itself is common (liking photos) that doesn't imply attraction necessarily. \n\nBut the problem here is the perception and the established boundaries. The girlfriend's point is that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" in this context, implying that any interaction with a close female friend could lead to issues. However, the author hasn't crossed into other areas of the relationship. \n\nThe core is whether the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Even if the like was innocent, if it causes her distress and she perceives it as cheating, then the author might need to consider her feelings. But the author isn't directly doing anything that's a violation unless their relationship's boundaries explicitly state not to like certain photos. \n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. However, since the girlfriend is perceiving it as cheating and the author didn't have ill intent, but might not have communicated or considered her perspective enough, the author could be partially at fault. But maybe not entirely. \n\nIn many cases, the person who feels wronged is in their right to express that feeling. If the boyfriend's actions are within the agreed-upon boundaries, then he's not wrong. But if the girlfriend's rules are that liking certain photos of close friends is off-limits, then he is wrong. The problem is the girlfriend's assertion that there's no such thing as a female friend, which is a bit extreme. However, the act of liking the photo could still be a problem if it's not respectful of her feelings.\n\nI think the answer would be B (No), because the author didn't have malicious intent and the action in itself isn't inherently cheating. But it's a communication issue. The girlfriend might need to express her boundaries more clearly, and the author should respect her feelings even if he sees it as innocent.\n"
