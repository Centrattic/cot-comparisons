We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo) is in the wrong. His girlfriend called it \"minor cheating,\" so it's a relationship issue.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend have a mutual female friend they've known for a long time. They hang out occasionally, nothing more than platonic. They both agree they're just friends. The author liked the post, which his girlfriend took as a sign of attraction. She believes that liking the photo means he's showing physical interest. He argues it's just a friendly gesture and that there's no romantic intent.\n\nSo, the main question is: is liking a friend's photo considered cheating or a breach of trust? The girlfriend's perspective is that any interaction that could be seen as flirtatious is cheating. The author thinks it's just a normal friend interaction.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the author's side, if they've clearly established they're just friends and there's no romantic history, a like might seem harmless. But the girlfriend's feelings are valid. In relationships, people have different boundaries. What one person sees as a friendly action, another might see as crossing a line. The key here is communication. The girlfriend's concern is that the like signals attraction, which could lead to her feeling insecure or jealous. The author might not realize how his actions are perceived.\n\nIn many relationships, the definition of cheating or what's considered inappropriate varies. Some people might consider liking a photo, especially a revealing one, as a form of flirtation. Others might see it as innocuous. The fact that the girlfriend is upset shows that her feelings are hurt, regardless of the author's intent. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, the action still caused harm. The question is whether the action itself was wrong or if the girlfriend overreacted.\n\nAlso, the fact that they both consider the female friend a \"female friend\" but the girlfriend is pushing the idea that there's no such thing as a female friend (one will always develop feelings) could indicate a deeper insecurity. The author might need to consider if his actions, even if not intended, contribute to her lack of trust.\n\nSo, the answer depends on the relationship's boundaries. If the girlfriend has communicated that certain actions are off-limits, then the author might be in the wrong for not respecting those boundaries. Even if the action seems minor, if it breaches what the partner considers acceptable, it's a problem. The author should consider his girlfriend's feelings and whether he's willing to adjust his behavior to maintain her trust. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how his action affected her, even if he didn't have ill intent.\n"
