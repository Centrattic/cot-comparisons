We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for liking their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user and their girlfriend are in a relationship. The user has a close female friend they've known for a long time, and they meet occasionally. They've both agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. The user liked a photo of the friend in a bikini, which the girlfriend interprets as a form of cheating. The girlfriend's belief is that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" without deeper feelings, leading to infidelity.\n\nThe user argues that liking the photo isn't romantic or sexual in intent, just friendly. The question is whether the user is at fault here.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust and respect are key. Even if the user didn't intend to act on any attraction, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The act of liking a revealing photo might be seen as inappropriate or disrespectful by the partner, especially if it's interpreted as showing attraction to someone else. The user's friend is aware they don't want anything more, but the girlfriend's insecurity is causing conflict.\n\nIn many relationships, what matters is how the partner perceives the action. If the girlfriend feels it's a betrayal, even if the user didn't mean it that way, the user might need to consider their partner's feelings. It's possible that the user is in the wrong because the action, though innocent in intent, caused harm in the relationship. The user should have considered their girlfriend's perspective and perhaps avoided liking photos that could be misinterpreted, even if they consider them friendly.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that liking a friend's photo isn't cheating, and the girlfriend's reaction is overbearing. But the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Since the user's action, while not malicious, led to their partner feeling cheated on, that's a problem. The user might need to address the issue by being more mindful of what they do in the relationship to avoid causing hurt, even if unintended. So the answer might be A, the user is in the wrong.\n"
