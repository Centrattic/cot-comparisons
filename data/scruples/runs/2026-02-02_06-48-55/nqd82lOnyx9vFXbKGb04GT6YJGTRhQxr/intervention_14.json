We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about liking a female friend's bikini photo on Facebook, which the girlfriend considers minor cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author claims that the friend is just a good friend, no attraction, and they've been clear about only being friends. The girlfriend feels that liking the photo is a sign of attraction and cheating. The author's argument is that the like doesn't mean anything more than friendship. \n\nNow, considering the definition of cheating. Traditionally, cheating involves a breach of trust in a relationship, often involving emotional or physical infidelity. Liking a photo is a public action, but the girlfriend interprets it as a sign of attraction. The key here is intent and perception. The author didn't have the intent to cheat, but the act might still cause hurt or insecurity if the girlfriend is uncomfortable with it. \n\nFriendship boundaries are important. Even if the author sees it as a harmless like, the girlfriend's reaction shows that it's a boundary issue. In relationships, respecting a partner's feelings and boundaries is crucial. So even if the author didn't mean to cross a line, the act of liking the photo might be seen as crossing a boundary the girlfriend has set. \n\nCommunication is a big factor here. The author and girlfriend need to discuss what's acceptable. The girlfriend's perspective is that any physical attraction shown towards another person is a problem. The author believes it's just friendship. The question is whether the like is enough to be considered in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of societal views, some might say that a like is minor and not cheating, while others might think it's a subtle form of emotional infidelity. The answer depends on the relationship's dynamics. Since the girlfriend feels hurt and calls it cheating, the author should consider that their action, though not intended to harm, still caused distress. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily cheating, but they might be inconsiderate of their partner's feelings. The answer might hinge on whether the like was a boundary violation. If the girlfriend clearly communicated that such likes are uncomfortable, then the author should heed that. If not, maybe it's a misunderstanding. However, since the girlfriend is upset, the author should take responsibility for not addressing her concerns proactively. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be the asshole for the action itself, but there's room for them to be in the wrong for not considering their partner's feelings more deeply. But the answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) if the action was unintentional and the relationship's boundaries aren't clearly communicated as such. However, if the girlfriend's feelings are valid and the author should have been more mindful, then it could be A. \n\nHmm, tricky. I think the answer is B because the like itself isn't cheating, but the author should acknowledge their partner's feelings. But since the question is strictly about being in the wrong, maybe it's B because the act isn't inherently wrong, but the author needs to address the girlfriend's concerns.\n"
