We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for liking their female friend's bikini photo, according to their girlfriend who called it \"minor cheating.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a long-term female friend they meet occasionally, and they've clarified there's no romantic interest. They usually like each other's Facebook posts. The girlfriend is upset because liking a bikini photo implies attraction and is considered cheating.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries in relationships. The girlfriend feels that even a like can signify attraction, which the author didn't intend. The author believes it's a harmless action between friends, but the girlfriend sees it as crossing a line.\n\nI should consider both perspectives. From the girlfriend's viewpoint, trust is crucial. She might feel that any form of engagement with an ex or close friend, especially something that could be seen as flirtatious, is a betrayal. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the action still caused hurt, which matters in a relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that they have a clear, platonic friendship and that liking posts is common. They don't have any romantic intentions. However, the problem isn't the author's intent but the girlfriend's feelings and how she interprets the action.\n\nIn relationships, what one person considers innocent might not be seen the same by their partner. The girlfriend's reaction stems from her perception of the action affecting trust. So, even if the author didn't intend to cheat, the act of liking a potentially provocative photo might be seen as violating the trust they've built.\n\nIt's also about communication. The author might need to consider their partner's feelings and maybe avoid actions that could be misinterpreted, even if they're benign. The fact that the girlfriend feels this strongly suggests that the action, while minor to the author, is significant to her.\n\nSo, while the author might not have malicious intent, the impact on their girlfriend is real. Therefore, the author could be at fault for not being considerate enough of her feelings and boundaries. The answer would depend on whether intent or impact is more important in this scenario. Since relationships often require mutual respect of each other's boundaries, the author's action might be seen as crossing a line, even unintentionally.\n"
