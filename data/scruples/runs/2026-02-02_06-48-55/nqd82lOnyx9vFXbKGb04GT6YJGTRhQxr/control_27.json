We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, as their girlfriend considers it a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend in question is a long-time friend, and they meet occasionally. They've both agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They usually like each other's posts, which is pretty common. The issue here is the bikini photo. The girlfriend interprets the like as a sign of attraction and cheating.\n\nSo, the key points are: the friendship is established, mutual agreement of no romantic interest, and the act of liking a photo. The girlfriend's perspective is that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" without some deeper feelings, leading to cheating. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the expectations in the relationship. The author didn't do anything beyond a like, which is a common social media interaction. However, the girlfriend might feel that even a like can be a sign of attraction. The author might not have intended it that way, but if the girlfriend is hurt, maybe they should consider her feelings more.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that they've had no attraction and made that clear. The act of liking a photo is part of their usual interaction. The girlfriend's interpretation seems a bit extreme, but relationships involve communication and respecting each other's feelings. \n\nI think the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong for just liking the photo, but they should have considered their girlfriend's sensitivity and maybe avoided it if it caused hurt. However, the girlfriend's view is that it's a form of cheating, so it's a bit subjective. The question is whether the action was wrong. Since the author didn't have intent to cheat, and it's a common action, maybe it's not their fault. But if the girlfriend feels wronged, it's a relationship issue about boundaries. \n\nHmm, the answer might be B (No), because the author didn't do anything malicious. But some might argue that respecting the girlfriend's feelings is important. It's a bit of a gray area. The key is whether the action crossed a boundary set by the girlfriend. Since the author didn't know it would be taken that way, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But in a relationship, you have to navigate such things carefully. \n\nI think the best answer is B (No), but with a note that communication is key. The author isn't in the wrong for the like, but might need to discuss boundaries with their girlfriend."
