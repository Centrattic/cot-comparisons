We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong. The girlfriend considers it minor cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is a long-time acquaintance, and they see each other every few months. They've established that there's no romantic interest. The author likes her posts, including this bikini photo, which the girlfriend took issue with.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the relationship between the author and the friend, the meaning behind a Facebook like, and the girlfriend's perspective. The author argues it's just friendly interaction, while the girlfriend interprets it as a sign of attraction.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries can be subjective. What one person sees as innocent, another might find problematic. The author's action wasn't direct interaction but a public like. However, the girlfriend's feeling of betrayal suggests that the action crossed a boundary in their relationship.\n\nBut is the author really at fault? If they have a clear understanding with their friend and the like was a habitual, friendly gesture, maybe not. However, the girlfriend's discomfort is valid. The author might not be \"cheating\" in a traditional sense, but they didn't consider how their action affects their partner's feelings. Not all actions that hurt a partner are malicious, but if they know it upsets the other person, they might be expected to avoid it.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether respecting the partner's feelings is part of the responsibility. Since the author didn't acknowledge the girlfriend's concerns beforehand, maybe they are in the wrong. But if the like was harmless and the girlfriend is overreacting, then no. But given the girlfriend's perspective and the emphasis on trust, the author might need to adjust their behavior to respect their partner's boundaries. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes) or B (No). Hmm. I think it's a bit nuanced. The action itself isn't cheating, but not respecting the partner's feelings could make the author at fault. So maybe A.\n"
