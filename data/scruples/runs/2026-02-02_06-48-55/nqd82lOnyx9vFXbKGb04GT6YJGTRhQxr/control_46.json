We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he liked a photo of his female friend wearing a bikini on Facebook, and his girlfriend is upset, calling it minor cheating. They've known each other for a long time and have a clear understanding that they're just friends. They don't have any romantic or physical attraction towards each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's girlfriend feels that liking the photo shows attraction, which he denies. The friend is a platonic friend, and they both agree they don't want anything more. The act in question is a simple like on a social media post. \n\nNow, whether liking a photo constitutes cheating or not depends on the relationship dynamics between the couple. Cheating typically involves actions that violate trust or boundaries in a romantic relationship. If the couple had an agreement that not doing anything that could be perceived as flirtatious or showing attraction to others is necessary, then a like might be seen as crossing that line. But if there's no such agreement, and the action is a common social media behavior without any intent beyond friendship, then it might be unfair to call it cheating.\n\nThe key here is whether the action was intentional or not. The author states that he likes her posts in general, not just the bikini photo. So it's part of their usual interaction. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that this specific action implies attraction. It's possible that the girlfriend is feeling insecure or that the action is a trigger for her. In that case, maybe the author could have considered her feelings and chosen not to like the photo, even if he doesn't see it as a big deal. But is that the author's fault? If the couple hasn't discussed boundaries regarding social media interactions, it's hard to say. \n\nAlso, the concept of \"minor cheating\" can be subjective. Some people might view any action that they interpret as showing attraction as a form of emotional cheating, even if the person doesn't intend it that way. However, others might argue that liking a photo is a trivial action that doesn't equate to cheating. \n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, he might need to be more aware of how his actions affect his girlfriend, even if he doesn't see them as problematic. Communication is key here. If the girlfriend has expressed that such actions make her uncomfortable, the author might need to adjust his behavior, not necessarily because it's inherently wrong, but to respect her feelings. However, if this is the first time she's brought it up and the author has no intention of it being a problem, then maybe the girlfriend is overreacting. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether there's an established boundary in the relationship. If there's no prior agreement, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the girlfriend has communicated that this kind of action is off-limits, then the author might be at fault for not respecting her boundaries. Since the scenario doesn't mention prior discussions about social media interactions, it's ambiguous. However, the girlfriend's perspective is valid in that she feels it's a violation, even if the author doesn't see it that way. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong hinges on the couple's agreed-upon boundaries. If they haven't discussed this before, the author might not be at fault, but he should consider his girlfriend's feelings and maybe adjust his actions to avoid causing her distress. On the other hand, the girlfriend's interpretation might be based on insecurity rather than actual wrongdoing by the author. It's a bit of a gray area, but without prior boundaries, the author's action isn't inherently cheating.\n"
