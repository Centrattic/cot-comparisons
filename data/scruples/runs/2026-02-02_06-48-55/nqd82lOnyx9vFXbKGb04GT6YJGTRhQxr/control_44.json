We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, according to their girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, the situation: They have a long-time female friend they meet occasionally, and they both like each other's posts. The friend posted a bikini photo while traveling, and the author liked it. The girlfriend considers this a form of cheating. The author argues that they have a platonic relationship and that liking the photo was just a friendly gesture.\n\nSo, the key points here are about the boundaries in a relationship. The girlfriend feels that liking the photo implies attraction, which crosses a line. The author sees it as innocent. The question is whether the author is wrong for liking the photo.\n\nI need to consider social norms and relationship dynamics. In many relationships, partners have different comfort levels with friends of the opposite sex. What one person sees as harmless, another might find problematic. The author's actions might not be malicious, but if the girlfriend interprets it as a breach of trust, then it's a problem from her perspective. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they've both agreed they don't want anything more than friendship, so maybe the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling insecure or mistrustful. But the author's actions could still be seen as crossing a boundary by liking a photo that's more revealing than usual. \n\nHowever, liking a photo is a common interaction on social media. Unless the couple had specific agreements about not engaging with that type of content, the action itself might not be inherently wrong. But since this caused conflict, the author might need to acknowledge the girlfriend's feelings and adjust their behavior to respect her boundaries, even if they don't see the issue.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the action was intentional or hurtful. If the author didn't mean to upset their girlfriend, but the girlfriend still feels wronged, it's a matter of perspective. But in relationship advice contexts, people often suggest that respecting a partner's feelings is crucial, even if the action seems minor. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but they might need to be more considerate of their partner's sensitivities. But according to the girlfriend's POV, she's seeing it as cheating, so the question is whether the author is an asshole for not seeing her perspective. The answer could be B (not wrong), but there's a nuance here.\n"
