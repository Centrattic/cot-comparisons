We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's girlfriend is upset because he liked a photo of a female friend wearing a bikini on Facebook. They've known each other for a long time, see each other occasionally, and consider themselves just friends with no romantic feelings. The girlfriend thinks this is a form of cheating, calling it \"minor cheating,\" and believes that liking the photo shows attraction and that there's no such thing as a platonic female friend.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author and his friend have a long-standing, non-romantic relationship. They meet occasionally, do normal friend activities, and have explicitly stated they don't want anything more. The friend posted a photo from a trip, and he liked it. He also likes her other posts. The issue is specifically about liking a photo where she's in a bikini.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's perspective is that liking such a photo indicates attraction and is a step towards cheating. She thinks platonic female friendships can lead to one person developing more feelings, making it inevitable that one will cheat. The author feels this is unfair.\n\nIs liking a photo of a friend in a bikini a form of cheating? In many relationships, what constitutes cheating can vary. Some people might see liking a photo as harmless, while others might perceive it as showing interest. The key here is the girlfriend's interpretation. If she feels it's a problem, then from her viewpoint, it's an issue. However, the author maintains that there's no romantic intent or attraction, and the friend is just a good friend.\n\nI need to consider if the act of liking the photo, given their established friendship and no history of attraction, is wrong. Since they communicate openly and have clarified their boundaries (no interest in each other beyond friendship), the action seems within those boundaries. However, the girlfriend's insecurity or past experiences might be causing her to overreact. But from a relationship standpoint, if one partner is uncomfortable with a specific action, even if it's seen as harmless by the other, it could strain the relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the action doesn't violate their agreed-upon boundaries, then the author isn't technically wrong. But if the girlfriend's feelings are valid because she perceives it as a breach of trust, then maybe there's a misunderstanding or miscommunication. The author could address her concerns by discussing why she feels that way and reassurance, but the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not about resolving the conflict.\n\nIn many cases, actions that are seen as trivial by one partner can be significant to the other. The fact that the girlfriend labels it as \"minor cheating\" might indicate that in her mind, it's a form of betrayal. However, platonic friendships with friends of the opposite sex are common and don't inherently involve cheating. The author's actions don't indicate a breach of the relationship's boundaries as they've set them, but the girlfriend's interpretation is based on her own beliefs about relationships.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the action actually crossed the boundaries they've agreed upon. If they've always considered each other just friends and the author didn't have any intention of showing attraction, then he's not in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend's perspective is that this action undermines their relationship, then he might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. But the question is if he's in the wrong, and from an objective standpoint, liking a friend's photo isn't inherently wrong unless there's a prior agreement against it. Since they haven't agreed not to like each other's photos, the author isn't necessarily at fault. The issue is more about the girlfriend's interpretation and their communication.\n"
