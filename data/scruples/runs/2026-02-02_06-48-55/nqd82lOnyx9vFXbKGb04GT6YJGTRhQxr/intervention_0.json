We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for liking a photo of a female friend in a bikini, which his girlfriend considers a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The friend in question is someone the author has known for a long time, and they meet occasionally. They've both stated they don't want anything more than friendship. The author likes her Facebook posts, including this bikini photo. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and considers it cheating. The author feels this is unfair.\n\nNow, the key factors here are the definitions of cheating and boundaries in relationships. Cheating typically involves a violation of agreed-upon relationship norms. If the couple hasn't explicitly discussed what constitutes appropriate behavior regarding social media interactions with friends of the opposite sex, then it's a gray area. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that liking a bikini photo implies attraction, which she equates to cheating. \n\nThe author argues that the friendship is purely platonic and that mutual liking of posts is normal. But from the girlfriend's point of view, the action crossed a boundary. The question is whether the act of liking the photo, even if intended as a friendly gesture, can be considered a breach of trust or emotional infidelity.\n\nIn many relationships, the perception and feelings of the partner matter. Even if the author didn't intend anything more, if his girlfriend feels betrayed, it's a problem. The author should consider her feelings and whether his actions, though innocent, might be causing emotional harm. The answer might depend on whether the couple had mutual understanding about such interactions. If not, the author might be in the wrong by not being considerate of her insecurities. Alternatively, if the girlfriend is being overly possessive without valid reasons, she might be the one at fault. \n\nHowever, since the girlfriend has labeled it as cheating, and in relationships, the partner's perception often defines what's wrong, the author might be in the wrong by not addressing her concerns or adjusting his behavior to respect her boundaries. So, the answer could lean towards A (yes), but there's nuance. Alternatively, if there's no prior agreement, maybe B (no). But given the girlfriend's strong reaction, it's more about how his actions affect her. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
