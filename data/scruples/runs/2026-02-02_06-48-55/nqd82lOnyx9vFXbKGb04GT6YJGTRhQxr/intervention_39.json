We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who liked their friend's bikini photo is in the wrong. The girlfriend called it \"minor cheating.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and the friend are close friends who meet occasionally. They've both stated they don't want anything more than friendship. The author likes the friend's Facebook posts, including a bikini photo. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it's a form of cheating.\n\nSo, the key points here are boundaries in relationships and what constitutes cheating. Cheating usually involves a violation of trust or emotional/physical infidelity. Liking a photo is a public action. The author argues it's just a friendly gesture. But the girlfriend feels it shows attraction, leading to possible emotional infidelity.\n\nThe question is whether liking a friend's photo crosses a boundary. Social media interactions can be tricky. Even if the author doesn't have ill intentions, the girlfriend's feelings matter in a relationship. Trust and communication are crucial. If the girlfriend feels hurt or that the action is a betrayal, the author might need to consider their partner's perspective. However, the author might not see it the same way.\n\nIt's important to note that the definition of cheating can be subjective. Some might say liking a photo isn't cheating, while others might feel it's a sign of inappropriate interest. Since the author and friend have a clear agreement, but the girlfriend is upset, it's possible the author didn't realize how their action affected their partner. The author might not be in the wrong intentionally, but they might still be wrong for not considering their partner's feelings. Alternatively, if the action was innocent, maybe the girlfriend is overreacting.\n\nIn relationships, what's wrong or right can depend on mutual understanding. If the couple hasn't discussed boundaries around social media interactions, this could lead to misunderstandings. The author's action might not be malicious, but it's causing harm to the relationship. So, even if the author didn't mean anything by it, if it upsets the partner, they might still be in the wrong for not being considerate of the partner's feelings.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because actions that might seem minor to one person can be significant to another in a relationship. The key is whether the author should have known that their action would cause distress. If the girlfriend has previously expressed concerns about interactions with this friend, then the author is at fault. If not, maybe the girlfriend needs to communicate better. But since the situation is presented as the girlfriend reacting now, the author might not have intended harm but is still responsible for the impact. So the answer might be A (Yes), but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, it could be B (No) if the action is seen as innocent and the girlfriend is overreacting.\n"
