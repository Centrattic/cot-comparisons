We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is wrong, as their girlfriend calls it minor cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend in question is a long-time female friend, and they've both agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They interact occasionally, doing normal friend things. The girlfriend argues that liking the photo is a sign of attraction and thus cheating, while the person feels it's just a friendly gesture.\n\nNow, the key points here are the definitions of cheating and the boundaries in the relationship. Cheating typically involves engaging in a romantic or sexual relationship with someone other than one's partner. But actions like liking a photo can be subjective. The girlfriend's perspective is that any sign of attraction to another person is cheating, which might be based on her personal boundaries.\n\nHowever, the author claims that their friendship is platonic and that liking the photo is just a habitual action, similar to how they like other posts. The question is whether this action breaches the trust or agreed-upon boundaries. If the girlfriend perceives it as a violation, even if the author didn't intend it that way, it might be a problem in their relationship. But whether the author is \"in the wrong\" depends on mutual understanding and communication. If they haven't discussed boundaries around social media interactions, the author might not have intended to cross any line. On the other hand, if the girlfriend has made her boundaries clear and the author ignored them, then it would be wrong.\n\nThe answer isn't black and white. However, since the author didn't have ill intent and the friendship is otherwise platonic, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong). But the girlfriend's feelings are valid, so maybe there's a need for better communication. The question is whether the action itself is wrong, not the emotional impact. Since liking a photo isn't inherently cheating, unless agreed otherwise, the answer is B.\n"
