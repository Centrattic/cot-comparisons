We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, as their girlfriend considers it \"minor cheating.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend in question is a long-time friend, they hang out occasionally, and they've both agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They like each other's posts on Facebook, which seems common. The issue here is liking a specific photo where the friend is in a bikini. The girlfriend interprets this as the author being physically attracted and thus cheating.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's perspective is that there's no such thing as a female friend without romantic feelings, leading to cheating. The author feels this is unfair. \n\nThe key points to consider: Did the author have intent beyond friendship? They've established that they don't want anything more. Liking a photo could be seen as just a friendly gesture, but the girlfriend is hurt by it. Is liking a photo enough to be considered cheating? It depends on cultural norms, personal boundaries, and the couple's agreements. \n\nIn relationships, perceptions and communication matter a lot. If the girlfriend sees it as a boundary violation, even if the author didn't mean it that way, the impact is real. However, the author didn't have malicious intent and has a history of friendship without attraction. \n\nSo, is it a clear case of the author being wrong? Maybe not. But the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The answer might depend on whether actions (like liking) without intent can be considered wrong if they cause harm. Alternatively, if the couple hasn't discussed social media boundaries, the author might not be aware of the implications. \n\nIn many cases, the perception and the hurt matter. If the girlfriend feels betrayed, the author might need to acknowledge her feelings even if they didn't intend to cross a line. But whether it's \"the wrong\" is subjective. Some might say B (not in the wrong) because intent is innocent, while others say A (in the wrong) because actions can affect relationships despite intent.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B because the author didn't act with malicious intent and the friendship has been established as non-romantic. However, the situation highlights the importance of communication between partners about what's acceptable. The author might not be in the wrong, but they should address the girlfriend's feelings to prevent future issues.\n"
