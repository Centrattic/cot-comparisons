We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, as their girlfriend called it \"minor cheating.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: The person has a long-term female friend they see every 1.5 months. They explicitly stated they don't want anything more than friendship. Their interactions are casual, like watching movies and drinking beer. They mutually like each other's Facebook posts, which is common in many friendships. The issue arose when the friend posted a bikini photo, and the person liked it. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of physical attraction and considers it cheating.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B). The key factors here are the definition of cheating from the girlfriend's perspective and the intent behind the like. The author claims there's no attraction and that they consider the friend just a friend. However, the girlfriend feels that any sign of attraction, even a like, is crossing a boundary.\n\nCheating isn't just about physical actions; it's also about the emotional impact and the boundaries set in the relationship. The girlfriend's reaction is based on her perception that the like indicates attraction. Even if the author didn't mean it that way, the action might still hurt her. In relationships, communication is crucial. The author's action, while perhaps innocent, might be seen as violating the trust their girlfriend expects. \n\nThe friend's POV is that there's no such thing as a \"female friend,\" which suggests she doesn't believe in platonic relationships with friends of the opposite sex. This could be a personal insecurity or a boundary set by her. If the author knew this boundary, then liking the photo could be considered disrespectful. However, the author says they usually like each other's posts, so maybe they didn't think it was different. \n\nBut, the girlfriend might feel that liking a bikini photo is different from other likes, especially if it's a sensitive topic. The author might need to consider how their actions affect their partner, even if they don't have ill intent. The fact that the girlfriend is upset and calls it cheating means it's a relationship issue that needs to be addressed. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the action, though innocent, disregards the girlfriend's feelings and boundaries. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable with it, then the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that boundary. The author should probably have been more aware of their partner's sensitivities in this case. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n"
