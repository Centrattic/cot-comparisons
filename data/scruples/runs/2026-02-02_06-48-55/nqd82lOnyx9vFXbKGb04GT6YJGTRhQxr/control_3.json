We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong according to their girlfriend's perspective. The girlfriend considers it a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The friend is described as someone they've known for a long time, meet occasionally, and have a platonic relationship. They confirm they don't have any romantic feelings and have mutual understanding. The issue is the like on a bikini photo. The girlfriend feels this indicates attraction and is a form of cheating.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author (the person who liked the photo) is the asshole here. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nNow, considering relationship boundaries. The girlfriend's belief is that liking such a photo shows physical attraction and is a step towards cheating. However, the author argues it's just a friendly gesture, part of their usual interaction. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. The author might not see the like as problematic, but the girlfriend does. The question is whether the action itself is wrong or if it's a matter of differing perceptions. Since the author and the friend have a clear agreement to stay platonic, the like might be innocent. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid because in relationships, partners often set boundaries about interactions with others. If the girlfriend feels that liking photos, especially revealing ones, is a boundary that shouldn't be crossed, then the author might be crossing that line, even if unintentionally.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? It's possible that the issue isn't the act itself but the fact that the author didn't consider their partner's feelings. Even if the like is innocent, not acknowledging the partner's perspective could be seen as dismissive. On the flip side, if the couple hasn't discussed social media interactions, it's unclear if the author knew that liking such photos was an issue. However, since the girlfriend is bringing it up as cheating, it's a red flag for her. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the action breaches the established trust or if it's a miscommunication. The author might not be in the wrong if the action was harmless and the couple hadn't discussed boundaries, but the girlfriend's reaction is about how it makes her feel. In relationships, how your partner feels about your actions matters. If the author's action causes emotional distress to the girlfriend, then it could be seen as the author being in the wrong, even if they didn't intend it. \n\nAlternatively, if the action was within normal friend interactions and the girlfriend is setting unreasonable boundaries, then the author isn't wrong. But since the girlfriend is framing it as cheating, it's a significant issue for her. The author might need to consider her feelings more and perhaps adjust their behavior to respect her boundaries, even if they see it as trivial. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the action, while harmless in the author's eyes, is causing harm to the relationship. If the girlfriend interprets it as cheating, then the author's actions could be considered wrong because they're not respecting their partner's emotional needs. However, if the couple hasn't established those boundaries, the author might not be at fault. But since the girlfriend is clearly upset and views it as cheating, the author's failure to recognize her feelings could make them the asshole.\n"
