We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo is in the wrong. The girlfriend is calling it \"minor cheating,\" but the author thinks it's unfair. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: They've known each other for a long time, meet occasionally, and consider each other just friends. They've even told each other they don't want anything more. The friend posted a bikini photo on Facebook, and the author liked it. Now the girlfriend is upset, interpreting the like as a sign of attraction or wanting to be more than friends.\n\nHmm. The key here is the perception and the expectations in the relationship. The girlfriend feels that liking a friend's bikini photo is a form of cheating because she believes there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" without eventual romantic feelings. The author sees it as just a friendly gesture, part of their usual interaction of liking each other's posts.\n\nI should consider what's considered cheating in relationships. Cheating usually involves some form of infidelity, like physical or emotional intimacy with someone else. But liking a photo is a digital action. The question is whether that action breaches the boundaries the couple has agreed upon. \n\nThe girlfriend's point of view is that the like is a sign of attraction. If the couple had established that liking such photos is off-limits, then the author might be wrong. However, if the couple didn't have prior discussions about this, then the girlfriend's assumption might be the issue. The author mentions they usually like each other's posts, implying it's part of their normal friendship. \n\nBut the problem is that the girlfriend is taking it as a problem. It's about their mutual understanding. If the girlfriend feels uncomfortable and the author didn't consider her feelings, even if they meant no harm, the author might still be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries. On the flip side, the girlfriend might be overreacting if the like was just a friendly action. \n\nAlso, the concept of \"female friends\" being problematic is a common debate. Some people think that close friendships with the opposite sex are inherently risky, while others see them as innocent. The author's argument is that they have a clear, non-romantic relationship. However, the girlfriend's perception is that the like is a step towards something more. \n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on if there was a prior agreement about such actions and the girlfriend's comfort. If the girlfriend felt it crossed a line and the author didn't check with her or adjust, that could be the problem. But if the like was just a regular interaction and the girlfriend is imposing her own insecurities without prior discussion, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nIn the absence of explicit boundaries, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in relationships, communication is key. The author might have failed to consider the girlfriend's perspective, even if their intention was innocent. The girlfriend might be right to express her discomfort, but the author could also be justified if there were no prior rules about this. \n\nI think the answer depends on the couple's specific agreements. Since the author didn't mention discussing this with their girlfriend before, it's possible the author didn't realize the action could be hurtful. However, the girlfriend has the right to set her boundaries. So maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both to communicate better. The question is whether the like was a breach of trust. If the girlfriend interprets it that way, even if the author didn't mean it, the author might be at fault for not respecting her feelings. But if the like was just a typical friend interaction and the girlfriend is projecting her own insecurities, the author isn't wrong. \n\nGiven that, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the action was a simple like, and there's no mention of prior agreements against it. However, the girlfriend's feelings are still valid, so maybe the author should have been more considerate. But the definition here is subjective. The main point is that the girlfriend is taking it as cheating. If the author's actions, though innocent, are making the girlfriend feel cheated on, then the author might be in the wrong for not addressing her feelings. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not necessarily if the girlfriend is right. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's POV is that the like is cheating. So the author's act is being seen as cheating by their partner. Even if the author intended no harm, if their partner feels cheated, then maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting the partner's feelings. But if there's no mutual agreement on what's acceptable, it's not the author's fault. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because liking a friend's photo isn't inherently cheating unless there's a prior agreement that it is. The author might need to talk to their girlfriend about her feelings, but it's not their fault unless they agreed not to like such photos. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid, so maybe the author should be more understanding, but the act itself isn't wrong. Alternatively, if the girlfriend is the one who set the expectation that such likes are problematic, then the author is in the wrong for not abiding by that. But the original question doesn't mention prior discussions. So I'm torn. \n\nMaybe the key is that the girlfriend is asserting that it's a form of cheating. If the girlfriend defines it as cheating, then the author is in the wrong by her standards. However, the author's POV is that it's innocent. But the question is from the girlfriend's perspective. So the answer might be A (Yes) if the girlfriend's definition of cheating includes this. But the author is asking if they are the asshole (ITA). The community might say that even if the action is innocent, if it makes the girlfriend feel that way, the author is being inconsiderate. But without prior communication, is it the author's fault? \n\nIn the end, I think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong for liking a photo unless there was an explicit agreement against it. The girlfriend's discomfort is valid, but the act itself isn't necessarily cheating. The main issue is the lack of communication, but neither party is entirely wrong.\n"
