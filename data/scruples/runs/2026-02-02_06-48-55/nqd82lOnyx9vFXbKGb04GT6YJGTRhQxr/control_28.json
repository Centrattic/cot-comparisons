We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for liking a photo of a female friend in a bikini. The girlfriend considers it a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author claims that the friend is just a good friend with no romantic feelings. They've been friends a long time and meet occasionally. They both know they don't want more than friendship. The girlfriend, however, feels that liking the photo shows attraction and is cheating.\n\nThe key points here are the nature of the relationship between the author and the friend, the girlfriend's perspective, and societal norms around what constitutes cheating. The author argues that liking a friend's photo is normal, especially since they do it regularly. The girlfriend's argument is that any form of positive attention towards someone else, even online, is a form of cheating.\n\nI should consider if there's a breach of trust or boundaries. If the couple had an agreement that they shouldn't interact with others in certain ways, then maybe the author is in the wrong. However, the author didn't have a specific conversation with the girlfriend about social media interactions. The girlfriend's concern is about the implication of attraction, but the author doesn't share that view.\n\nAlso, the concept of \"female friends\" leading to cheating is a common stereotype, but it's not universally accepted. The author's actions might not be intentional, just a friendly gesture. The girlfriend's interpretation is subjective here. \n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the couple's agreed-upon boundaries. If the girlfriend interprets it as cheating and this causes her distress, the author might need to be more mindful. But without prior discussion, it's hard to say the author is wrong. The answer might lie in communication rather than a black-and-white judgment. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's feelings are valid, then maybe the author should adjust their actions to respect her feelings, even if they don't personally see it as cheating. But culturally, some might say it's not wrong. \n\nHmm. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the action itself is innocent and there's no explicit agreement against it. However, the girlfriend's feelings matter in a relationship. The author's perspective is that there's no wrongdoing, but the girlfriend's perspective is that it's cheating. The answer might hinge on the relationship dynamics. Since the question is from the author's POV asking if they're the asshole, maybe the answer is B because the action isn't inherently wrong, but the author might need to have a conversation to address the girlfriend's concerns. So the author isn't in the wrong, but should consider the girlfriend's feelings more carefully.\n"
