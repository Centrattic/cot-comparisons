We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, as his girlfriend considers it minor cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationships. The friend is a long-time acquaintance, and they've met occasionally. They've both agreed that there's no romantic or physical attraction. The friend posted a photo while traveling, and the user liked it. His girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and a breach of trust.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The user and his friend have established boundaries, stating they're just friends. The act of liking a photo is a common social media interaction, often done without romantic intent. However, the girlfriend feels it's a form of cheating, which suggests she might have different expectations or insecurities.\n\nI should think about whether the act of liking a photo is inherently wrong. Liking a photo can be a compliment, not necessarily a romantic one. But if the girlfriend is hurt and the user knew or should have known that this could cause harm, then maybe he's at fault. However, if he had no intention and the friend has no romantic feelings, it's more about the girlfriend's perception.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. If the friend is indeed just a friend with no romantic feelings, then the like might not be cheating. But the girlfriend's feelings are important too. The user should communicate better to understand why this action upset her. But in terms of right or wrong, if there's no intent to cheat, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the relationship dynamics and the girlfriend's feelings need to be considered. The answer might depend on cultural or personal boundaries. Since the user and the friend have a clear agreement, the like might not be wrong, but the user needs to address his girlfriend's concerns.\n"
