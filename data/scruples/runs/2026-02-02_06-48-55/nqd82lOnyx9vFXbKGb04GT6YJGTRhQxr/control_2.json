We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo is in the wrong according to their girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that the friend is just a good friend with no romantic feelings, and they've both agreed on that. They like each other's posts occasionally, so this isn't unusual. The girlfriend, however, sees the like as a sign of physical attraction and a form of cheating.\n\nThe key here is the girlfriend's perspective. Even if the author didn't intend any wrongdoing, the girlfriend feels hurt and perceives it as cheating. In relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The author might not see the like as a big deal, but the girlfriend does. It's about boundaries and mutual respect. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend explicitly called it \"minor cheating,\" then the author might be at fault for not considering her feelings. Even if the action seems trivial, in the context of a relationship, actions that cause distress can be problematic. \n\nHowever, the author might not have been aware of the girlfriend's feelings about this. But since the girlfriend expressed her feelings after the fact, the author could be expected to adjust their behavior to respect her boundaries moving forward. Liking a photo isn't inherently cheating, but if it breaches the girlfriend's trust, it could be seen as wrong.\n\nSo, considering the girlfriend's point of view and the impact of the action, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. The author did clarify that they have a platonic relationship and that they both agreed on it. Still, the girlfriend's perception is valid here. The author might not be a cheater, but they might have acted in a way that's disrespectful to their partner's feelings. So, A seems correct.\n"
