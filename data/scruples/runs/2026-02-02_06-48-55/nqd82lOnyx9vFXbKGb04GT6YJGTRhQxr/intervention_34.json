We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for liking his female friend's bikini photo on Facebook, and his girlfriend considers it \"minor cheating.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author has a long-time female friend they meet occasionally, and they've both agreed they don't have romantic feelings. They like each other's posts on Facebook. The issue arises when the author likes a photo where the friend is in a bikini. The girlfriend feels this is cheating because it shows attraction.\n\nSo, is liking a photo considered cheating? Well, cheating typically involves emotional or physical infidelity. The author and the friend aren't in a relationship. But the girlfriend feels that the like signifies attraction, which she interprets as a breach of trust.\n\nThe key here is the girlfriend's perception. Even if the author doesn't have ill intent, actions can be perceived differently. In relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she might feel insecure or that the like is a boundary the author shouldn't cross. The author might argue it's just a friendly like, but the girlfriend's feeling is valid in the context of their relationship.\n\nBut is the author actually wrong? If both he and the friend agreed they're just friends, then a like on a photo might not be inherently wrong. However, if his actions made his girlfriend feel insecure or violated her trust, then maybe he should consider her feelings more. It's about mutual respect and understanding the partner's boundaries, even if they aren't explicit.\n\nThe author could have communicated with his girlfriend about the friendship and ensured his actions weren't making her uncomfortable. Maybe a simple conversation could have clarified what's acceptable. But from a strict \"cheating\" standpoint, unless there's an agreement not to interact with friends in a certain way, it's a gray area. However, since the girlfriend feels it's cheating, the author's actions affected their relationship negatively. So, maybe the answer is A, but I need to weigh both sides carefully.\n"
