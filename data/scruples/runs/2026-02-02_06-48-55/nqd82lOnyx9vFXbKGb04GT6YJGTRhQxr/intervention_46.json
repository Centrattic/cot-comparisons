We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user liked a photo of his female friend who was in a bikini on Facebook. His girlfriend is upset, calling it \"minor cheating.\" The user argues that they're just friends, have been for a long time, and there's no attraction. They don't see each other often, and they both agree they don't want anything more than friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the girlfriend. She feels that liking the bikini photo shows attraction, which is a form of cheating. Even if the user doesn't intend it that way, in a relationship, actions can be perceived differently based on the partner's feelings and boundaries. The girlfriend might have insecurities or a different view on what constitutes emotional or physical boundaries in a relationship. If she interprets the like as a sign of attraction or affection beyond friendship, then from her perspective, it's a betrayal.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's side is that they're just friends and they've made that clear. They like each other's posts regularly, and this was no different. The user might not see a problem with liking a photo, especially since they don't have any romantic feelings. But communication is key in relationships. If the girlfriend hasn't previously established that liking such photos is an issue, the user might not realize it's a problem. However, once the girlfriend raised it, the user's responsibility is to respect her feelings and adjust their behavior to maintain trust.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. The answer depends on the definition of cheating. If the girlfriend defines this action as cheating, even if it's minor, then according to her standards, the user is in the wrong. In relationships, trust and respecting each other's boundaries are crucial. If the user is aware of the girlfriend's feelings and continues the behavior, that could be seen as dismissive of her emotions. Even if the user didn't mean to, the impact on the girlfriend matters here.\n\nHowever, if the user truly has no intention of attracting attention or showing affection, and has communicated that they see the friend as just a friend, then the issue might stem from the girlfriend's insecurities rather than the user's actions. But the problem arises when the user doesn't acknowledge or validate the girlfriend's feelings, leading to potential strain in the relationship.\n\nIn many cases, what one person considers innocent, another might not. The key is how the girlfriend feels. If she's hurt and sees it as a breach of trust, then the user should take that seriously. So, even if the user isn't intentionally cheating, not addressing the girlfriend's concerns could be seen as inconsiderate. So, the user might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their action affects their partner's emotional state and trust, even if the action itself seems minor.\n"
