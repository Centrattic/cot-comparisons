We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author is asking if they're the asshole for liking a photo of their female friend in a bikini, where their girlfriend considers it cheating.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the context of the friendship. The author and this female friend have been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and both have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They often like each other's Facebook posts. The girlfriend argues that liking the bikini photo shows attraction and is a form of cheating.\n\nThe author's girlfriend holds the belief that a \"female friend\" can't exist without one developing stronger feelings, leading to cheating. The author disagrees and feels this is unfair.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is wrong. From a typical perspective, liking a photo on social media is a common, usually innocent action. However, in a relationship, what's acceptable can depend on the couple's boundaries and how each person perceives actions. The girlfriend's interpretation is that the like signifies attraction, which she equates to cheating. But the author maintains that the friendship is purely platonic and that the like was just a friendly gesture.\n\nI need to consider if the author's action crossed a line. Since the friend is in a bikini, the girlfriend might feel it's a provocative context. But the author has a history of liking posts, not just this one. The issue here is the specific context of the bikini photo. However, the author's intent was likely neutral, given their established friendship and mutual agreement on boundaries. The girlfriend's discomfort stems from her perception of the action, which the author might not have realized could be upsetting.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the girlfriend has concerns about such actions, it's important for both parties to discuss and agree on what's acceptable. The author might not be intentionally cheating, but if their actions make the girlfriend feel insecure, there's room for discussion. However, the act of liking a photo itself might not inherently be wrong unless there's an understanding that such actions are off-limits. Since the author claims they've always liked each other's posts, maybe the girlfriend's reaction is more about the specific content (bikini) even though the action (like) is the same as before.\n\nIn conclusion, while the girlfriend's feelings are valid and should be respected, the author didn't necessarily intend to cross a boundary. The act of liking a photo isn't inherently cheating unless both parties agree that it is. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but the situation highlights the need for better communication between the couple about their boundaries.\n"
