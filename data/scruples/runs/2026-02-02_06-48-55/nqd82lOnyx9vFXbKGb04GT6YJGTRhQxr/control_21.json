We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, according to their girlfriend who considers it \"minor cheating.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationships. The friend in question is a long-time friend they occasionally meet with, and both have clarified they don't have romantic intentions. The act in question is a Facebook like on a bikini photo. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and sees it as cheating.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points here are consent and boundaries within the relationship. The girlfriend's perspective is that even a like can be a breach, which might stem from her insecurities or the couple's specific boundaries. Since the author didn't have romantic intentions, but the action upset the girlfriend, this is more about communication and mutual understanding rather than a clear right or wrong.\n\nIn relationships, what one person sees as harmless, another might find offensive. The author might not be in the wrong from an objective standpoint, but the action did cause discomfort. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author might need to consider her perspective to maintain relationship harmony. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being entirely in the wrong (B), but there's a nuance where respecting the girlfriend's feelings is important.\n"
