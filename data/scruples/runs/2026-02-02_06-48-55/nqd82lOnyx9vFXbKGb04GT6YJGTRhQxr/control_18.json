We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question (AITA) is in the wrong for liking a photo of his female friend in a bikini, as his girlfriend considers it a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context he provided. They are good friends who have been friends a long time. They meet occasionally, once every 1.5 months. They've both stated they don't want anything more than friendship. The girlfriend is upset because liking the photo is seen as showing attraction, which she calls cheating.\n\nNow, the question is about whether liking a photo counts as cheating. The author argues there's no romantic intent, but the girlfriend feels differently. The key here is mutual understanding and boundaries. The friends have a clear agreement that they're just friends, but the girlfriend feels that any form of attention, even a like, crosses the line.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries are crucial. If the girlfriend feels uncomfortable with the likes, especially on a bikini photo, that's her perspective. Even if the author thinks it's innocent, his actions can still hurt his girlfriend. The concept of \"cheating\" can vary between individuals. Some might see emotional or physical intimacy with someone else as cheating, even if it's not sexual.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's POV is that there's no such thing as a female friend without potential attraction. The author might need to respect her feelings and adjust his actions to maintain trust. Even if he doesn't see it as cheating, respecting her boundaries is part of a healthy relationship.\n\nSo, considering the girlfriend's feelings and the impact of his actions, even if he didn't mean it that way, his like could be seen as crossing a boundary. Therefore, he might be in the wrong from her perspective.\n"
