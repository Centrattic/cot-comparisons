We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person who liked their friend's bikini photo is in the wrong. The girlfriend called it minor cheating. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: they have a long-time female friend who's just a friend. They interact occasionally, no romantic feelings. They both acknowledge they don't want anything more. The person liked a beach photo of her in a bikini. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it's a sign of attraction and cheating.\n\nHmm. The user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA). So the key points here are the nature of the friendship, the context of the like, and the girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFrom the author's side, they say they like each other's posts normally. This particular photo was a bikini picture. But they argue there's no romantic intent. The girlfriend, however, feels that liking such a photo indicates attraction and could lead to more, which she sees as cheating.\n\nNow, considering social norms, liking a friend's photo isn't inherently wrong. But in a relationship, boundaries can be subjective. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or different views on what's acceptable. The author might not see it as a big deal, but the girlfriend does. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the act of liking a bikini photo crosses a boundary in their relationship. Since both parties have different perceptions, it's more about the girlfriend's feelings rather than an objective wrongdoing. The author didn't have malicious intent, but the girlfriend feels hurt. \n\nIn many relationships, what one person sees as innocent, the other might not. So, while the author isn't necessarily cheating, their action caused distress. They might need to consider their partner's feelings more. However, technically, liking a photo isn't cheating unless it's part of a pattern of behavior that the partner finds unacceptable. \n\nThe answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because the act itself isn't cheating, but the situation requires communication and understanding. However, some might argue that the author should have been more mindful of their partner's feelings. But since there's no explicit agreement about not liking such photos, it's tricky. \n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't intentionally cheating, but they need to be more sensitive. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since there's no malicious intent and it's a single like, probably not. So answer B.\n"
