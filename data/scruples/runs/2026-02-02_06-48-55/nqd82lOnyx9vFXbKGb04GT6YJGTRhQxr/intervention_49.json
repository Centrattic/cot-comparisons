We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for liking a photo of a female friend in a bikini, and their girlfriend considers it cheating. The friend is someone they've known for a long time, and they meet occasionally. They both have clarified they don't want anything more than friendship. They usually like each other's Facebook posts, but this time it was a bikini photo. The girlfriend thinks that liking the photo shows attraction and is a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author and the friend have explicitly stated they don't want anything more than friendship. The act in question is a like on a photo. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction. But the author argues it's just a friendly interaction, part of their usual behavior.\n\nWhat does liking a photo mean? Social media likes can be ambiguous. Some people use likes to show appreciation for content, not necessarily attraction. However, others might see it differently, especially in a relationship where boundaries are important. The key here is whether the action could be seen as crossing a boundary set by the girlfriend.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that any form of interaction that shows attraction, even if unintentional, is cheating. She believes that having a \"female friend\" could lead to more feelings and infidelity. The author feels it's unfair, but maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nIs liking a bikini photo inherently a boundary violation? It depends on the couple's agreed-upon boundaries. If the girlfriend views this as cheating, then from her perspective, the author is in the wrong. However, if the author didn't intend it as attraction and it's part of their normal interaction, maybe the issue is communication or differing expectations.\n\nThe problem might be that the author didn't consider their girlfriend's feelings and how this action could be perceived. Even if it's a like, in a relationship, certain actions can be sensitive. The fact that the girlfriend brought it up suggests that it's a dealbreaker for her. The author might not be intentionally cheating, but they might not be respecting the girlfriend's emotional boundaries.\n\nAnother angle: if the author and the friend have a history of liking each other's posts, does that make the like less significant? Maybe, but the bikini photo is more personal and could be seen as more intimate. The girlfriend could feel that even a like in this context shows a different level of attention.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If the girlfriend feels insecure or that boundaries are being pushed, the author might need to adjust their behavior, even if they don't see it as cheating. The author might not be in the wrong if they didn't intend harm, but they could be unaware of the impact of their actions. However, since the girlfriend considers it cheating, the author's action does affect the relationship negatively, which could make them partly at fault.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their action, while perhaps not malicious, is causing distress and is considered cheating by their partner. Alternatively, it could be B (not in the wrong) if the action is within the bounds of their agreed-upon relationship norms. But since the girlfriend interprets it as cheating and the author didn't communicate about boundaries, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being considerate of their partner's feelings.\n"
