We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for liking a photo of a female friend in a bikini, which his girlfriend considers minor cheating. Hmm. The author and his friend have been friends a long time, meet occasionally, and they both agree they don't want anything more than friendship. He likes her Facebook posts, including this bikini photo. The girlfriend thinks that liking the photo shows attraction and is cheating.\n\nSo, the key points here. First, the author's intention. He says they're just friends and he likes her posts as part of their friendship. But the girlfriend interprets it as a sign of attraction. The author argues that liking a photo is just a friendly gesture. But the girlfriend feels it's a boundary crossed.\n\nNow, in relationships, boundaries and perceptions matter a lot. Even if the author doesn't feel he's being unfaithful, his actions might affect his partner's feelings. The girlfriend's perspective is that any form of liking a photo from a close female friend could imply attraction, which she's not comfortable with. So, it's about trust and how each partner defines what's acceptable.\n\nThe author mentions that he and his friend have clarified their boundaries, but maybe the girlfriend feels that even maintaining those boundaries isn't enough. The question is whether the act of liking a photo, in this context, is wrong. Some people might say it's not cheating because it's a public gesture and part of normal friendship. Others might say that in a relationship, certain actions can be perceived as crossing lines, especially if they make the partner uncomfortable.\n\nThe author's girlfriend's viewpoint is that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" without potential romantic feelings. That's a common insecurity in relationships, but it's also subjective. The author's actions, while not malicious, might still hurt his partner's feelings. So, even if he didn't intend it, if it causes his partner distress, maybe he is in the wrong for not considering her feelings more carefully.\n\nAlso, the fact that they met up occasionally and have a good friendship might make the girlfriend more sensitive. Liking a bikini photo could be seen as more personal than other photos. The author might need to think about whether his actions are respectful of his partner's comfort level.\n\nIn conclusion, while the act of liking a photo might seem harmless, the impact on the partner is significant. The author might not be intentionally cheating, but he's not considering how his actions affect his girlfriend. Therefore, he could be in the wrong for not addressing her feelings and adjusting his behavior to respect her boundaries.\n"
