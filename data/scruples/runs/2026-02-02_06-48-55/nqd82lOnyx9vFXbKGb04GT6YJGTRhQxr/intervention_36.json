We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who liked the photo) is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who considers the act of liking a bikini photo of a female friend as a form of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has a long-time female friend with whom they have a platonic relationship. They meet occasionally, have mutual understanding that they don't want anything more than friendship. The author likes the friend's Facebook posts, including a specific bikini photo. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and calls it cheating.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether liking a photo of a friend in a bikini is a betrayal of the girlfriend. The author argues that they have a platonic relationship and that liking the photo was just a normal interaction. The girlfriend believes that any such interaction could lead to deeper feelings and thus is cheating.\n\nI should consider the definition of cheating. Cheating typically involves engaging in a romantic or sexual relationship outside of the committed partnership. However, some people might have different boundaries and consider certain actions as crossing lines even if they don't involve physical contact. The girlfriend's perspective is that liking the photo shows attraction, which could lead to a relationship, hence cheating. \n\nThe author, on the other hand, believes that since there's no actual romantic or sexual interaction, it's not cheating. The key here is whether the action violates the trust and boundaries set in the relationship. The author and the friend have explicitly stated they don't want anything more than friendship, so maybe the action isn't intentional. However, the girlfriend feels hurt and sees it as a breach of trust.\n\nCommunication is a big factor here. The author might not have considered how the action could be perceived by the girlfriend. Even if the intent was innocent, the effect on the partner matters. In relationships, what's important is how each partner feels and whether actions align with the mutual understanding they have. If the girlfriend has clearly communicated that such likes make her uncomfortable, then the author should respect that boundary.\n\nAlso, the fact that they like each other's posts regularly might not be an issue except for this specific photo. The bikini photo might trigger different feelings compared to regular photos. The author might not have realized the sensitivity around this particular image.\n\nIn summary, while the author might not have intended to cheat, their action caused distress to the girlfriend. In a committed relationship, partners need to be mindful of each other's boundaries, even in seemingly small actions. The girlfriend's reaction is based on her feelings of insecurity and the belief that such likes represent attraction. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong if they didn't consider their partner's feelings and the boundaries they've agreed upon, even if unintentionally.\n"
