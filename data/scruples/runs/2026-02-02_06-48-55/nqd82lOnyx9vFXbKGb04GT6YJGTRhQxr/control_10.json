We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, as his girlfriend considers it a form of cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The friend is someone they've known for a long time and only meet occasionally. They've both agreed that the relationship is strictly platonic. The friend likes the author's posts and vice versa, which seems to be a normal part of their friendship.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that liking a photo of a friend in a bikini is a sign of physical attraction and thus cheating. But the author argues that there's no romantic or sexual intent, just a friendly interaction. \n\nNow, the key here is whether the action (liking the photo) constitutes cheating. Cheating typically involves a betrayal of trust or emotional/physical infidelity. In this case, there's no physical contact or emotional attachment beyond friendship. However, the girlfriend feels hurt because she interprets the like as a sign of attraction.\n\nThe concept of \"female friends\" being bound to develop more feelings is a belief the girlfriend holds, but that's not a universal truth. The author has maintained a platonic relationship with the friend, as both parties have agreed. So, from an objective standpoint, the act of liking a photo doesn't inherently mean cheating unless there's an established boundary against it. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything that violates the agreed-upon boundaries of their friendship. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, but they stem from her interpretation of the like as a sign of attraction, which might be a personal insecurity or misunderstanding. The author isn't the one acting in bad faith here; he's following the terms of their friendship. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The issue lies more in the girlfriend's perception and the couple's communication about boundaries.\n"
