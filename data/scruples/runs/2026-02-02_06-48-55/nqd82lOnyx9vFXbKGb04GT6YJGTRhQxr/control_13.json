We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for liking a photo of his female friend in a bikini. His girlfriend called it minor cheating. The author says they're just friends and have no romantic feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is a long-time friend, they meet occasionally, and they've both agreed they don't want anything more. They like each other's posts normally. The issue was a specific bikini photo. The girlfriend feels that liking it shows attraction, which is a form of cheating.\n\nSo, whether it's wrong depends on the relationship boundaries. The author might not see it as a big deal, but the girlfriend does. The question is about whether the author is wrong according to societal norms or the situation's specifics.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. If both partners have agreed on what's acceptable, then actions outside that might be problematic. The author didn't think it was an issue, but the girlfriend does. It's possible the author didn't realize the action could be seen as crossing a boundary, but the girlfriend's perspective is valid in this scenario. However, the author didn't intend to be disrespectful or cheat. The act itself is a like, which is common on social media. But if the girlfriend interprets it as a sign of attraction, then maybe the author should consider her feelings. \n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? It's subjective. If both partners had agreed that liking such photos is okay, then maybe not. However, if the girlfriend now feels it's a boundary crossed, then the author's action, while not malicious, might be seen as a breach of trust. However, the author didn't have ill intent, so maybe it's not entirely his fault. But the girlfriend's feelings are important here. The answer hinges on whether the action, regardless of intent, is perceived as cheating. Since the girlfriend defines it as such, the author might need to adjust to respect her boundaries. But does that make him the asshole? Maybe not, but he could be in the wrong if he's aware of her boundaries and still does it. Wait, in the scenario, the author didn't know she felt that way until after the fact. So he might not have crossed a known boundary. \n\nSo, in this case, the answer might be B (No), because the author didn't have malicious intent and the action itself is common. However, the girlfriend's perspective is valid, so the author should communicate and adjust to her feelings. But technically, he's not in the wrong, just needs to be more considerate in the future. So the answer is B.\n"
