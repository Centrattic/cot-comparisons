We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for liking a friend's bikini photo, which his girlfriend considers minor cheating.\n\nFirst, the context: The friend is female, they've known each other for a long time, meet occasionally, and both have declared no romantic feelings. They often like each other's posts. The girlfriend thinks liking the photo shows attraction and counts as cheating.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the act of liking the photo, given their established friendship, is crossing a boundary. The author argues it's just a friendly interaction, while the girlfriend sees it as a violation of the relationship.\n\nI need to consider relationship norms. Some people might feel that liking a photo of a friend in a swimsuit is innocuous, especially if they're just friends. However, the girlfriend's feeling is that it's a form of cheating because it's showing attraction. The key here is mutual understanding and respect in the relationship. If the boyfriend didn't realize that this action upset her, maybe he's not intentionally wrong. But if he knew and did it anyway, maybe that's different.\n\nThe question is whether the act itself is wrong. Since they have a clear boundary (no romantic feelings), the act of liking might not be intentional. The problem here is the girlfriend's perception. However, if the boyfriend didn't consider her feelings and the action made her uncomfortable, then maybe he's at fault for not being more considerate. On the flip side, if he thought it was harmless and she hasn't communicated her boundaries clearly, she might be overreacting.\n\nBut the girlfriend's perspective is that liking the photo implies attraction. The author might not see it that way, but if the girlfriend is hurt by it, then the boyfriend's action could be seen as disrespectful of her feelings. Even if he didn't mean it that way, not acknowledging her feelings might make him at least partially wrong.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the action was a breach of trust or boundaries. If the couple hasn't discussed what's acceptable in terms of social media interactions, the boyfriend might not be in the wrong. But since the girlfriend is upset and considers it cheating, the boyfriend has a responsibility to address her concerns. Therefore, it's possible he's not entirely wrong, but maybe he should have been more aware of her feelings. The answer might be B (No), because the action itself isn't inherently wrong, but the situation requires communication. However, some might argue that the girlfriend's reaction is valid, so he is in the wrong. Hmm, tricky.\n"
