We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who liked their friend's bikini photo is in the wrong, as his girlfriend called it \"minor cheating.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is female, they've been friends a long time, see each other occasionally, and both have agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. The act in question is a Facebook like on a bikini photo. The girlfriend feels this is a sign of physical attraction and cheating.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is whether liking a photo constitutes cheating. The author argues it's just a friendly gesture, part of their usual interaction. The girlfriend feels it's crossing a boundary. \n\nIn relationships, what's considered cheating can vary. Traditionally, cheating involves physical or romantic intimacy, but some people might have different boundaries. The girlfriend's perspective is that any sign of attraction to someone else is cheating. But others might see liking a photo as neutral, especially if there's no history of romantic interest.\n\nThe key factors here are the intent of the author and the expectations set in the relationship. If the author and his friend have no romantic intentions and have communicated that, then a like might not be a big deal. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid because she's upset by this action. \n\nBut does the act of liking a photo actually betray the trust? It's a public gesture, but it's passive. The author didn't comment or message the friend about the photo. Maybe the girlfriend feels it's a breach because she's insecure or has different boundaries. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, if they've established a clear boundary between them and the friend, and the like is part of their usual interaction, then maybe not. But if the girlfriend feels hurt and this action undermines her trust, then maybe the author should consider her feelings more. \n\nHowever, the author didn't do anything more than a like. It's a common social media action. The girlfriend's definition of cheating might be more expansive than what the author is comfortable with. But relationships require both partners to respect each other's boundaries, even if they're not traditional. \n\nSo, if the girlfriend feels that a like is a problem, maybe the author should avoid it in the future to respect her feelings. But is that making him the asshole? It's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't intentionally being malicious, but he's not fully considering her perspective. \n\nIn the end, it's about communication. If they can't agree on what's acceptable, there might be deeper issues. But based on the information given, the author might not be in the wrong, but he should be more considerate of his girlfriend's feelings.\n"
