We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong according to their girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, the context: The friend is long-time, occasional contact, mutual agreement of just friendship. The girlfriend takes it as a form of cheating, interpreting the like as physical attraction. The author thinks it's unfair because they consider her just a friend and they've both agreed on keeping it that way.\n\nThe key points here are about the girlfriend's feelings and the interpretation of actions. In relationships, what one person sees as innocent, like a like on a photo, another might perceive as a boundary violation. Even if there's no romantic intent, the action can still hurt the partner if it's a trigger for insecurity or jealousy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the girlfriend's point of view, if she's in a monogamous relationship and her partner's actions (even if innocent) make her feel insecure or like the boundaries are being crossed, then the author might need to consider her feelings. The fact that they've both agreed on staying just friends is important, but the act of liking a bikini photo could still be seen as crossing a line, especially if the girlfriend feels it's a form of attention that shouldn't be given.\n\nHowever, the author might not have malicious intent, and the friendship has been established for a long time. It's possible the girlfriend is overreacting or projecting her own insecurities. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer depends on the context of the relationship's boundaries and mutual respect. If the girlfriend feels it's cheating, even if the author doesn't, the author might be in the wrong for not being considerate of her feelings and possibly violating the agreed-upon boundaries without discussing it.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the action, while seemingly innocent, can be seen as a breach of trust or boundary from the girlfriend's perspective. It's about mutual respect and understanding in the relationship.\n"
