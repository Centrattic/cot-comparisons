We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about liking a female friend's Facebook photo where she's in a bikini, and the girlfriend considers that a form of cheating. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: the author and this female friend have been friends for a long time. They meet occasionally, and they've both stated they don't want anything more than friendship. They like each other's posts on Facebook, which the author mentions is common. The issue arises when the author likes a photo of the friend in a bikini. The girlfriend interprets this as a sign of attraction and calls it cheating.\n\nThe key points here are the definitions of cheating and the boundaries in the relationship. Cheating typically involves engaging in a romantic or sexual relationship with someone other than one's partner. However, some people might have different boundaries, like not liking certain photos of others, especially if it's someone they're friends with. The author argues that it's just a friendly like, but the girlfriend sees it as crossing a line.\n\nNow, considering the author's intention. He says they have a clear understanding that they're just friends, and he didn't have any romantic intentions. But actions can speak louder than words. Even if the intention was innocent, the action might still hurt the girlfriend. The problem here is about trust and how each partner perceives boundaries. The girlfriend's perspective is that any form of attention, even a like, could be a step towards infidelity. The author might not see it that way, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid in the context of their relationship.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they both agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. If that's the case, then liking the photo might not be inherently wrong, but the girlfriend's discomfort is real. The question is whether the action, regardless of intent, is wrong in the context of their relationship. Since relationships are about mutual respect and understanding each other's boundaries, if the girlfriend feels that the like is inappropriate, then the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her feelings, even if he had no ill intent.\n\nAnother angle is social norms. In some cultures or relationships, liking a friend's photo in a swimsuit might be seen as flirtatious, even if it's unintentional. The author might be unaware of how such actions are perceived, but if it's causing distress, it's a boundary he should respect.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the action caused his girlfriend distress and she considers it cheating, then yes, he might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings and boundaries. Even if the action itself seems minor, the impact on the relationship is significant. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), but I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The author could argue that the like was innocent, but in a relationship, respecting the partner's comfort level is crucial. Hence, the answer would be A.\n"
