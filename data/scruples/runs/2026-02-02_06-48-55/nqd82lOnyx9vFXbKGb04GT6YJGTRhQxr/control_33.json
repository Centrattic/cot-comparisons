We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, as their girlfriend considers it \"minor cheating.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend is someone they've known for a long time, meet occasionally, and they've both agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They like each other's posts regularly, which seems to be a normal part of their friendship. The issue came up when the author liked a specific photo where the friend was in a bikini.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that liking the photo implies attraction and is a form of cheating. The author feels it's unfair because there's no romantic intent. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nI should consider social norms around liking photos on social media. Liking a friend's photo is generally seen as a positive interaction, not inherently romantic. Since the author and the friend have established a non-romantic relationship, the like might not be intended as flirting. However, the girlfriend's feelings are important, and maybe there's a communication gap here.\n\nBut the key point is whether the action constitutes cheating. Cheating typically involves betraying a partner's trust or engaging in romantic/sexual activity with someone else. A like on a photo isn't a physical or emotional affair. However, if the girlfriend perceives it as a breach of boundaries, it's a matter of mutual agreement and respect. The author might need to address the girlfriend's concerns, but technically, the act itself isn't cheating. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), but maybe there's a need for better communication between the couple to set boundaries regarding social media interactions. The act of liking the photo isn't inherently wrong, but the relationship dynamics might require discussion.\n"
