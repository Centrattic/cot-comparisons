We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo is in the wrong according to their girlfriend's perspective.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend in question is someone they've known for a long time, and they meet occasionally. They've both agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They usually like each other's posts, so this isn't an unusual action.\n\nThe girlfriend is interpreting the like as a sign of attraction and considers it cheating. But the author argues that it's just a friendly gesture. Now, whether it's wrong depends on cultural norms and personal boundaries. In some relationships, even small actions can be seen as crossing lines, especially if one partner is more sensitive. However, the author didn't have intentions of attraction, and the action itself is a common social media behavior among friends.\n\nThe key points are consent and mutual understanding. Since both friends agreed they don't want a romantic relationship, the like doesn't indicate betrayal unless there's a prior agreement that liking such photos is off-limits. The girlfriend's perspective is based on her feelings, but the action itself might not be inherently wrong unless both parties agreed it's a boundary.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the action was within their established friendship and didn't involve any physical interaction or intent beyond friendship. However, it's a sensitive issue, and the girlfriend's feelings are valid. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not about the girlfriend's feelings being invalid. Since the author didn't act with malicious intent, it's B.\n"
