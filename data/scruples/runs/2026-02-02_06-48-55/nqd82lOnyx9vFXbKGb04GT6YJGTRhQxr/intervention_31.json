We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about liking a female friend's bikini photo on Facebook, which the girlfriend considered minor cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has a long-term female friend, and they've both agreed they don't want more than a friendship. They meet occasionally and do normal friend activities. They like each other's Facebook posts, including this specific bikini photo. The girlfriend took offense, thinking it's a form of cheating because it shows attraction. The author feels it's unfair and is asking if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are the boundaries in a relationship. The girlfriend's perspective is that any form of liking a photo, especially a revealing one, is a sign of attraction and thus cheating. The author argues that it's just a friendly interaction, part of their usual behavior, and there's no deeper intent.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. In many relationships, partners set their own boundaries. What might be acceptable to one person could be a deal-breaker for another. The author's action might not be inherently wrong, but if the girlfriend feels it's a violation of trust, then it's a problem. The author's responsibility is to respect his girlfriend's boundaries, even if he doesn't see the issue himself.\n\nAlso, the idea that there's no such thing as a \"female friend\" comes from the girlfriend. This is a common dynamic where one partner fears the other might develop feelings for a friend. The author's defense is that they have a clear agreement, but actions can sometimes unintentionally cross lines.\n\nThe core question is whether the act of liking the photo is a breach of trust. If the girlfriend interprets it as attraction, then the author's action, even if meant as a simple like, is causing hurt. The author might not be in the wrong in a legal or moral sense, but in the context of his relationship, he's not respecting his partner's feelings. That could make him the asshole in the situation because maintaining the relationship requires mutual respect and consideration of each other's comfort levels.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even if the action is innocent, not acknowledging his girlfriend's feelings and boundaries could be seen as dismissive and hurtful.\n"
