We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he liked a photo of his female friend who is in a bikini on Facebook. His girlfriend is upset about it, calling it \"minor cheating.\" The friends have been clear about their boundaries\u2014no romantic feelings, just a platonic relationship. They meet occasionally and hang out in non-romantic ways.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what liking a photo actually implies. Liking a photo is a common social media interaction. People often like photos of friends to show support, acknowledge their posts, or just to engage. The friend in question has a history of liking each other's posts, so this might be part of their usual interaction. However, the girlfriend interprets the like as a sign of physical attraction, which the author denies.\n\nThe key here is whether the act of liking the bikini photo breaches the trust or boundaries in the author's relationship. The girlfriend's perspective is that any form of attention to another person, especially in revealing clothing, is a form of cheating. The author argues that there's no romantic intent and that the friendship is purely platonic.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author's action is wrong. If the couple has established boundaries that they should avoid any interaction with this friend that could be seen as flirtatious or suggestive, then liking a bikini photo might cross that line. However, if the couple hasn't discussed such specific boundaries, the girlfriend's reaction might be based on personal insecurities rather than the action itself.\n\nAnother angle is the context. The friends have been clear about their non-romantic relationship. The author didn't make any other advances or comments beyond a like. Social media interactions can be tricky because they're public, but the author's intent was just a like, not a deeper action. Still, the girlfriend's perception is valid in the sense that trust and communication are crucial in relationships. If the girlfriend feels hurt, the author should consider her feelings, even if he believes his actions were innocent.\n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? If he didn't have romantic intentions and the friendship is clearly platonic, maybe not. However, not considering his girlfriend's feelings in this situation could be a mistake. The problem might stem from a lack of communication between the couple about what behaviors are acceptable. The author might not be at fault for the action itself, but he might be at fault for not addressing his girlfriend's concerns and not respecting her perspective, which is important in maintaining trust.\n\nSo, the answer could depend on whether the action itself is wrong or if it's about the communication between the couple. If the girlfriend explicitly said that such actions make her uncomfortable, then the author should avoid them. But if she's bringing it up now without prior discussion, it's more about her insecurities. The author's responsibility is to navigate his girlfriend's feelings while maintaining his own friendships, which might require compromise or clearer communication.\n"
