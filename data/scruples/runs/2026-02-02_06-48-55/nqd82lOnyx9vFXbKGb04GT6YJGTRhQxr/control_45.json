We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo on Facebook is in the wrong, according to their girlfriend's claim of it being minor cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are that the friend is a long-time acquaintance, they meet occasionally, and they've both agreed that there's no romantic interest. They usually like each other's posts, and this time the friend posted a bikini photo. The girlfriend is upset because she thinks liking that photo is a sign of attraction and cheating.\n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? Well, from the author's perspective, they consider the friend a platonic friend and have always been clear about that. Liking a photo is a common social media interaction, even among friends. The girlfriend's perspective is that any form of attention, especially on a revealing photo, could imply attraction. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is wrong. It's important to note that boundaries in relationships can vary. The author didn't engage in anything beyond a like, which is a standard action. However, the girlfriend might feel insecure or see it as a breach of trust. The author's actions don't seem malicious or intentional, given their history with the friend.\n\nIn terms of cheating definitions, typically, cheating involves physical or emotional infidelity. A like on a photo might be a red flag for some, but it's not an act of cheating per se. The girlfriend's interpretation might stem from her own insecurities rather than the action itself. The author isn't in a situation where they've crossed a boundary unless their partner's comfort level is compromised. However, the author should have considered their partner's feelings and maybe avoided the like. But since the action was a like and not something more, it's debatable.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether liking a photo is considered a boundary violation. Since the author and friend have a history of mutual likes, it's part of their normal interaction. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on her own perspective rather than the action's inherent wrongness. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but they might need to address their partner's feelings to maintain trust.\n"
