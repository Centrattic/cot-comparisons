We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who liked their female friend's bikini photo is in the wrong, according to their girlfriend who considers it cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a long-time female friend they meet occasionally. They both like each other's Facebook posts as a norm. The girlfriend is upset that liking a bikini photo is a form of cheating. She believes that any female friend could lead to more feelings and thus is cheating. The author thinks it's unfair.\n\nSo, the key points are: the friendship is platonic, they don't have attraction, they meet occasionally, and the girlfriend feels the like is a sign of physical attraction. The author's girlfriend's POV is that there's no such thing as a platonic female friend, leading to cheating.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and common perspectives. Some people might see liking a friend's photo as harmless, especially if they've been friends for a long time and have established boundaries. However, others, like the girlfriend, might interpret it as flirtatious or a breach of trust, depending on their personal boundaries and insecurities.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If the girlfriend feels that this action is a violation, it's not just about the act itself but her perception and the boundaries they've set as a couple. Even if the author didn't intend anything, the action can be hurtful if it's seen as crossing a line.\n\nBut then again, the author's intention is to maintain a friendship, and they've stated their boundaries. The girlfriend's belief that all female friends are a threat to the relationship might be based on her insecurities or past experiences, not necessarily the author's actions. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if they didn't intend to flirt and the friendship is platonic, maybe not. But if the girlfriend has made it clear that such actions make her uncomfortable, and the author continued without addressing her feelings, then the author might be at fault for not respecting her boundaries, even if unintentionally.\n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend is overreacting based on assumptions that the author isn't responsible for, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the act of liking could be seen as a minor transgression if it's part of a pattern that the girlfriend finds problematic.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on the couple's dynamic and how they communicate their boundaries. If the author didn't know their girlfriend's feelings and the like was an isolated incident, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the girlfriend had previously expressed discomfort and the author ignored it, then they might be. Since the context here is that the girlfriend is calling it minor cheating, and the author didn't know beforehand, it's possible the author isn't at fault. However, the act itself could be a trigger for the girlfriend's insecurities, making the author's action problematic in the context of their relationship.\n"
