We are good friends, and we never had any attraction towards each other, we literally told one another that we don't want anything more than this from each other. When we hang out, we watch a movie, eat a hamburger, drink a beer, and chit-chat about everything that happened to us lately.\n\nMe and my friend usually like each others posts on facebook. There was an occasion when she was travelling abroad with another friend of hers, and she posted a photo of her being alone sitting in the beach in a bikini. I dropped a like on that picture (I also like other pictures of her, not just this one) and that was, apparently, something I shouldn't have done, and it's a form of cheating on her, according to my SO. In her mind, me dropping a like on that picture means that I like her, I'm physically attracted to her, and that is how I show it.\n\nSo my girlfriend's POW is that there is no such thing as a \"female friend\", one person from such a relationship is bound to have more feelings for the other and this will end up with me being a cheater.    \n\nI feel this is unfair from her side, but let's see if I'm the asshole her, or not. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI tried to be brief, but if you want some additional info, feel free to ask, I'm happy to explain more details.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for liking a bikini photo of a female friend. The girlfriend considers this a form of cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The author mentions that they've been friends for a long time, meet occasionally, and have mutually agreed they don't want anything more than friendship. They usually like each other's posts, and this instance was a bikini photo. The key here is whether a like constitutes cheating or betrayal.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that liking the photo shows attraction, which could lead to more feelings and thus cheating. But the author argues there's no romantic interest and they're just friends. The question is whether liking a photo, especially of someone in a bikini, is crossing a boundary despite the friendship.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. Even if the author didn't intend anything romantic, the action might be seen as a breach of trust if the girlfriend feels uncomfortable. However, it's also about mutual understanding. If the couple hasn't discussed boundaries regarding social media interactions, it's hard to say who's at fault.\n\nBut the girlfriend's interpretation is that any like could indicate attraction. That seems a bit extreme, but it's her feeling. The author might not be in the wrong if they didn't have intentions beyond friendship. However, if the action caused distress, maybe the author should have considered the girlfriend's feelings more.\n\nBut the core issue is whether a like is a minor form of cheating. Some might say yes, others no. The author is being accused of \"minor cheating,\" which is a subjective term. If the couple's definition of cheating includes any action that could be perceived as showing attraction to someone else, then maybe the author is in the wrong. But if the couple hasn't clearly defined boundaries, it's more about the girlfriend's insecurities.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong if they had no intention of being romantic, but the action might still be a problem if the girlfriend interprets it that way. However, the author could have been more considerate of the girlfriend's feelings. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the author didn't have malicious intent, the answer might be B (No). But some might argue that even unintentional actions can be hurtful, so maybe A (Yes). Hmm.\n"
