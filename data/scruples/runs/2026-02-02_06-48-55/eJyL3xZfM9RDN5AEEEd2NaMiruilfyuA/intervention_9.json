My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a couple where the husband is a doctor who wanted children, but his wife didn't. They made an agreement five years ago where she would agree to him having children with others if he couldn't find a way to have them together. Now, when he actually has friends willing to participate, she's upset and breaking the agreement. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband and wife had a prior agreement. The wife didn't want children, so they agreed that in five years, if the husband still wanted kids, he could have them with others while they stay married. The husband found two friends who are okay with this. Now the wife is backing out, and the husband is upset because he thought the deal was set.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. Let's consider their agreement. They made a verbal agreement five years ago, but agreements like this, especially involving such personal matters, can be complex. The wife's initial stance was against having children, and the husband wanted to have them. The agreement seems to be a compromise to stay married while fulfilling his desire for children. However, agreements like this might not account for changing emotions or circumstances over time.\n\nOne angle is that the husband is being selfish by wanting to have children with others while remaining married. This could be seen as a breach of trust or commitment, as such an arrangement is unconventional and might not be sustainable. The wife's change of heart could be due to realizing the emotional impact of the agreement or feeling used. On the other hand, the husband might feel the wife is breaking a promise they made under specific circumstances.\n\nAnother point is the nature of the agreement itself. It's possible that the wife thought it was a hypothetical solution in the future, not expecting the husband to actually follow through. People can make agreements in the heat of the moment or under certain conditions that they later reconsider. The husband moving forward might have ignored the possibility that her feelings or the terms might change over time.\n\nAlso, the legal and ethical implications. Legally, such an agreement might not hold, especially in terms of child custody, support, and rights. Emotionally, the wife might feel betrayed even if they had an agreement. The husband's approach could be seen as exploiting the situation for his own needs without fully considering her feelings or the long-term consequences.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If the wife feels the agreement was breached or if the circumstances have changed, the husband might be at fault for not addressing her current feelings and instead expecting her to stick to a past agreement. The fact that she's now upset suggests that the agreement might not have been as firm or considerate as the husband assumed.\n\nAdditionally, the wife's initial hope that the husband would change his mind about children indicates that their agreement might have been a temporary solution rather than a binding contract. The husband proceeding with the plan without considering her current perspective could be seen as inflexible or disrespectful.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband might believe he's honoring the agreement, the wife's emotional response and the unconventional nature of the arrangement suggest that the husband might be in the wrong by not respecting her current feelings and the potential for her to change her mind, even if they had an agreement. Relationships require ongoing communication and mutual respect, and expecting someone to adhere strictly to a past agreement without considering present circumstances could be problematic.\n"
