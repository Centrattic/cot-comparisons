My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author (let's say he's the husband) and his wife made a deal five years ago. The deal was that since he wanted kids and she didn't, they would find a way for him to have biological children without her. The plan was for him to have children with other women once he was a doctor, with the agreement that he wouldn't be the father but maybe an uncle. Now, he's found two friends who are willing to go along with this, but his wife is upset and wants to break up the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the original agreement. When they first made the deal, both were in agreement. The wife agreed to this arrangement so they could stay married, and the husband agreed to proceed under those terms. So in terms of contract, they both entered into an agreement. But here's the thing: this is a personal, ethical, and emotional agreement, not a legal contract. People can change their minds about such personal matters, even if they made an agreement.\n\nBut wait, the wife is now saying she didn't really expect the friends to agree. She might have thought it was a hypothetical solution, not one that would actually be carried out. The husband, on the other hand, took it seriously and followed through. So there's a misunderstanding here about the nature of the agreement. Did she truly consent to this, or was it a temporary solution to avoid divorce?\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of trust and the emotional impact. The husband is using his wife's agreement to have children with others, which is a big deal. Even if they made an agreement, the wife might feel betrayed now that it's happening. Plus, the idea of having children with other people, even as a donor, can have complex emotional and social consequences. The husband is expecting his wife to stick to the deal, but maybe she never intended for it to go forward if it became a real possibility.\n\nAnother point is the husband's motivation. He wants to pass on his genes, which is a personal desire, but it's important to consider if the wife's feelings have changed. She might have agreed under pressure to avoid divorce, not fully realizing the implications. Now that the situation is real, she's rethinking her position. That's a common issue in relationships where agreements are made under certain circumstances but tested later.\n\nAlso, the husband's solution involved third parties. The friends' willingness to participate might not have been considered by the wife when she agreed. The complexity of involving others could have led to unforeseen issues. The wife might feel that the agreement was more theoretical, not expecting actual people to step forward and allow this arrangement.\n\nIn terms of ethics, some might argue that the husband is in the wrong because he's expecting a spouse to accept such an arrangement without fully understanding the consequences. Others might say that since they both agreed initially, he's not wrong for following through. But given that the wife is now upset and feels the agreement was misunderstood, the husband might have a responsibility to reassess the situation.\n\nI should also consider cultural and societal norms. In many societies, such an arrangement is unconventional and could be seen as risky or inappropriate. The wife's reaction might be influenced by societal expectations, even if they had a personal agreement. The husband might not have considered how the agreement would affect their relationship in the long term.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because the agreement was made under different circumstances and might not have been fully thought through. The wife's change of heart after the situation became real suggests that the initial agreement was based on a hypothetical scenario, not a concrete plan. Therefore, expecting her to stick to the deal might be unrealistic and unfair.\n"
