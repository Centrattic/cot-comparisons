My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a couple who made an agreement five years ago about having children. The husband wanted kids, the wife didn't. To compromise, they agreed that when he became a doctor, he would ask his friends to have his child, with him providing child support and being like an uncle, not a father.\n\nNow, the husband has two friends who agreed, but the wife is upset and wants a divorce because she didn't expect the friends to agree. The user thinks the author (the husband) is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. Did both parties fully understand the implications? The wife might have thought the agreement was a way for the husband to move on without actually expecting him to go through with it. Maybe she believed it was a hypothetical solution, not a real plan. Agreements between spouses should be clear and mutual consent. If there was a misunderstanding about the terms, the husband might be at fault for not clarifying or ensuring her full agreement.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect is important. The wife didn't want children, and the husband's plan could cause emotional distress. Even if they made an agreement, the wife's feelings and expectations might have changed, or perhaps she didn't anticipate the reality of the situation. The husband's actions might be seen as not respecting her initial wishes or creating a situation that causes her additional stress.\n\nAnother angle is the nature of the agreement itself. Using friends as sperm donors without them being a part of the family dynamic could have unforeseen consequences. The wife's horror might stem from the practical and emotional implications she hadn't considered. The husband's plan might also raise ethical questions about the friends' consent and their understanding of the situation.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral obligations, the agreement was a personal one, not legally binding. However, the wife might feel betrayed if she believed the agreement was a temporary compromise, not a real plan. The husband's persistence in following through could be seen as disregarding her current feelings and the emotional toll it's taking on her.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the husband might be in the wrong because the agreement might not have been fully understood or accepted by both parties. The wife's distress and the ethical implications of the plan suggest that the husband didn't adequately consider her perspective or the long-term consequences of their agreement. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
