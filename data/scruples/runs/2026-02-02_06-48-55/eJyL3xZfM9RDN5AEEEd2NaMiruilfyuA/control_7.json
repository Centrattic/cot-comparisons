My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author and his wife married when he was in med school. They agreed that having children would wait until he was a full-time physician with a stable job. The wife, who is a bank teller, supported this plan. However, later, the wife revealed she doesn't want children. The author was upset and wanted to have kids to continue his family line. \n\nThey ended up making a unique agreement: the author would have children with other women (his friends) while staying married. The wife would handle the logistics like child support, but the author wouldn't be a father, just an uncle. The wife agreed five years ago, but now she's against it because she didn't think her husband would actually find friends to agree. Now she's appalled and considering divorce.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No).\n\nI should consider ethical, moral, and legal aspects. Legally, in many places, such an agreement might not be enforceable, and having children with others during a marriage could be seen as adultery or breach of trust. Even if consensual, the wife's consent now is invalidating the agreement. Emotionally, the wife's feelings have changed, and she's upset. The author's actions could be seen as using his wife to facilitate having kids elsewhere, which might be exploitative. Also, the wife's initial consent was under specific circumstances (maybe not fully expecting it to happen) which could be a factor. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, many people would find this arrangement unethical. Even if both parties agreed, the long-term implications and the impact on all parties involved (the friends, the children) are significant. The wife's current reaction suggests she didn't anticipate the full consequences when agreeing five years ago. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wanted to have children but couldn't with his wife, so he found a compromise. However, the key point is that the wife is now opposing the agreement she made. The author is now expecting her to uphold a deal she's now against. The question is whether he's in the wrong for expecting her to stick to it.\n\nIn many relationships, agreements can be revisited if circumstances change. The wife might feel that the situation has evolved beyond what she initially agreed to. The author, however, might feel betrayed because he followed through on his part of the deal. \n\nLegally, there's no enforceable contract here. Emotionally and ethically, it's a gray area. The wife's current distress and the author's pursuit of children through other women while married could be seen as a breach of the marital bond. Even consensually, it's unconventional and could be considered wrong by societal standards.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because the arrangement is ethically questionable and the wife is now unwilling to continue. Even if they made an agreement, relationships can change, and the wife's current feelings should be respected. The author's expectation to proceed without considering her current objections is problematic.\n"
