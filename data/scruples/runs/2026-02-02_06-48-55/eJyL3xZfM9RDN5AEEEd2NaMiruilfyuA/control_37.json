My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a couple who made an agreement five years ago about having children through alternative means because the wife doesn't want to be a mother. Now, the wife is upset that the author's friends agreed to the plan, and the author is frustrated that she's going back on their agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The wife agreed five years ago that the author could have children with other people when he became a physician. The author found two friends willing to participate, and now the wife is against it. The author feels wronged because they had an agreement, while the wife is now refusing to follow through.\n\nI should consider the dynamics of their relationship. They made a deal in the past, but maybe circumstances have changed for the wife. The wife might have realized she doesn't want her husband to have children with others, even if she agreed before. People's feelings can evolve, especially on such a significant issue. The agreement was made under certain conditions, but now the wife is reconsidering. Is it fair to hold someone to a past agreement if their feelings have changed? \n\nAlso, the wife's initial agreement was under specific circumstances\u2014during a time when they were both in a certain place in their lives. Now, with the reality of the situation approaching, she might have second thoughts. The emotional impact of the author having children with others could be a factor she didn't fully consider before. \n\nThe author's perspective is that they had an agreement, and the wife is breaking it. However, agreements about such a personal and life-altering decision might not be as binding as legal contracts. Emotional maturity and mutual understanding are crucial. If the wife is now uncomfortable with the plan, it's reasonable to reassess. \n\nAdditionally, the author is using his wife's own wishes as a reason to proceed, but she's not the one carrying the child. The wife's emotional state and relationship dynamics are critical here. The fact that she's appalled suggests that she didn't anticipate the actual social and emotional consequences. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might not be in the wrong for following through on an agreement, but the wife's right to change her mind must also be considered. Relationships require flexibility and communication. If the wife is now uncomfortable, it's possible that the original agreement wasn't fully thought through, or there was an underlying assumption that might not have been clear. \n\nUltimately, the core issue is whether a past agreement can be enforced if one party's feelings change. The wife might be in the right to reevaluate her stance, especially since the situation is now real and affecting her personally. The author's actions, while based on an agreement, could be seen as disregarding his wife's current feelings and the complexity of the situation. Therefore, the author could be seen as in the wrong for not respecting his wife's current position and not accommodating the possibility that her initial agreement was under different emotional or situational circumstances.\n"
