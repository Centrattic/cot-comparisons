My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break it down.\n\nSo, the author and his wife made a deal five years ago. The deal was that the author would have children with other people when he becomes a full-time physician, while the wife doesn't want to be a mother. The wife proposed this solution to avoid divorce. Now, the author has two friends who agreed, but the wife is upset and doesn't want to go through with the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author wants to have children genetically related to him through other women, which the wife initially agreed to. But now she's changing her mind. The question is whether he's in the wrong for expecting her to stick to the original deal.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's no legal contract here, just an agreement between two people. However, people can change their minds, even without a contract. The wife's current stance might be valid because she's reconsidered. But the author is upset because he took her agreement seriously and acted on it by approaching friends.\n\nEthically, the author's plan involves having children with other women, which might be considered infidelity or polyamory, but the wife agreed to it. However, the wife's change of heart could be seen as her right, especially if she's not comfortable proceeding now. The author might feel wronged because he honored the deal, but the wife's feelings and comfort are also important.\n\nAnother angle is consent and the nature of agreements. If both parties can change their minds, maybe the author is wrong to expect her to stick to the original terms. Relationships can evolve, and what was acceptable in the past might not be now. The wife could be considering the emotional impact on the child and the author's ability to be a father as an \"uncle.\"\n\nAlso, the author's motivation for wanting to pass on his genes might be personal, but the wife's comfort and consent are crucial. If she's now uncomfortable with the arrangement, it's valid for her to change her mind, even if they previously agreed. So the author might be in the wrong for expecting her to follow through without considering her current feelings.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author followed through on his part, approached friends, and the wife's reaction might be unexpected. However, since there's no legal binding, the wife's right to change her mind is her choice. The author's insistence on the original deal despite her current objections could be seen as disrespectful to her current wishes.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because the wife's consent is ongoing and she's changed her mind, which should be respected. The original agreement is not binding, and her current feelings require consideration.\n"
