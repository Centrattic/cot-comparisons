My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. \n\nFirst, there's the initial agreement between the author and his wife. They made a deal five years ago so that the author could have children without the wife being a mother. The wife agreed to this, understanding that he wanted to pass on his genes. Now, after five years, the author found two friends who are willing to go through with the plan, but the wife is upset and refuses to honor the agreement.\n\nThe key points here are the original agreement, the wife's current reaction, and whether the author had the right to expect her to stick to the deal. The wife is now saying she didn't expect his friends to agree, which implies she might not have been serious about the agreement. However, the author followed through on his part by finding willing participants. \n\nBut there's a problem here. The agreement involved the author fathering children with other women, which is a significant and non-trivial commitment. Even if both parties agreed initially, the wife's change of heart might be valid because the situation's complexity and emotional impact could have been underestimated. Additionally, the author is using his wife's body and resources (like child support) in a way that might not be ethically sound, even with her consent. \n\nAnother angle is the wife's original reluctance about having children. She didn't want to be a mother, so maybe the agreement was a compromise. Now, the compromise is causing her distress. The author might be in the wrong because he assumed the agreement would hold without considering how her feelings might evolve or the potential for unforeseen consequences. \n\nAlso, the idea of having children with other women might not be a standard or healthy relationship dynamic. The wife's shock at the friends agreeing could stem from realizing the gravity of the situation, which she hadn't fully considered when they made the deal. The author might have been too focused on his own desire for children to see the potential harm in the arrangement. \n\nIn terms of ethics, even if there was a mutual agreement, the wife's current distress and the author's use of her in a non-traditional family setup could be problematic. The author might have been unrealistic in expecting the agreement to last without changes in circumstances or emotions. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong for not foreseeing the wife's change of heart and pushing through with a plan that's causing her significant distress.\n"
