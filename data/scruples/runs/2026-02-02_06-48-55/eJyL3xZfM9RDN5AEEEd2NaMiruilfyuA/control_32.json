My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. \n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The couple met when the author was in med school. They agreed that having children would wait until he was a practicing physician with a stable job. The wife didn't want to be a mother and suggested an alternative plan five years ago, where the author would have children with other women while they stay married. Now, after five years, the author has found two friends who agreed to this arrangement, but the wife is upset and wants to divorce.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for expecting the wife to stick to the original agreement. The wife is changing her stance now, even though they had a deal. The author is upset because the deal was made five years ago, and he's following through as agreed.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author might argue that the agreement was clear and mutual. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that the situation has changed, or that the original agreement was made under different circumstances. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the deal to hold.\n\nPossible angles: Was the original agreement fair or realistic? Did the wife have the right to change her mind, even if an agreement was made? Or does the author have a right to expect the agreement to be honored once both parties agreed?\n\nAlso, ethical considerations. Is it ethical for the author to pursue this arrangement with other women? Could that be the reason for the wife's current objection? Maybe the wife agreed under pressure or didn't foresee the emotional impact later.\n\nBut according to the story, the wife agreed to the plan five years ago. So the author is following through as per their agreement. However, the wife now is objecting, which might indicate she didn't mean it or changed her mind. \n\nIn terms of morality and ethics, even if they had an agreement, some might argue that the wife is wrong for going back on it. Others might say that the agreement was inherently flawed, and she has the right to her feelings now. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot because he's committed to the agreement, and the wife's change of heart is causing the conflict. But does that make the author wrong? If the agreement was made in good faith, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the agreement was unrealistic or if the wife didn't truly consent, then maybe he is.\n\nAnother angle: The author's main desire is to have children, which is important to him. The wife's stance is that she doesn't want to be a mother. Their compromise was this unusual arrangement. Now, the wife is upset that the author actually went through with it. \n\nBut according to their agreement, the author was supposed to proceed when he was ready. The wife might have thought he wouldn't find someone willing to participate, hence her surprise. However, the author did, and now she's against it. \n\nIs the author wrong for following through on a mutual agreement? If the wife agreed to the terms, then the author isn't necessarily at fault. However, the wife might have a valid point if she feels the arrangement is exploitative or emotionally damaging, even if they agreed to it. \n\nBut since the question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the wife to stick to the deal, the answer hinges on whether the agreement was valid and both parties understood the terms. If the wife agreed, then the author isn't wrong. But if the agreement was made under pressure, or if she misunderstood the terms, then maybe she's justified in changing her mind. \n\nThe story doesn't mention coercion, so the initial agreement seems mutual. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for following through. The wife is changing her stance now, which is causing the conflict. Hence, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
