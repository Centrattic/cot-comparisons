My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario involves a couple who made a deal five years ago about having children through the husband having a child with another woman. Now, the wife is upset that the husband found people willing to go along with this plan, and she's reconsidering the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple was in a relationship when the husband was in med school. They agreed that they would wait until he finished school and residency to have kids. The wife didn't want children, so they made a deal where the husband would have children with others while the wife agreed not to be a mother. Now, the husband has friends who agreed to this plan, and the wife is backing out.\n\nThe user thinks the author (husband) is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. The wife initially agreed to the arrangement but now regrets it. However, the husband followed through on their agreement. The question is whether the agreement itself is valid, especially regarding the wife's consent and the nature of the agreement.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, agreements between partners can change as circumstances or feelings evolve. The wife might not have fully considered the implications when she agreed five years ago. Also, the situation involves third parties (the friends) which adds complexity. The husband's actions could be seen as respecting their original agreement, but the wife's change of heart is understandable if she's uncomfortable with the reality.\n\nLegally, such agreements might not hold up, but the question is more about moral wrongdoing. The husband isn't forcing anyone; he's following through on a mutual agreement. However, the wife's current objections might indicate that the original agreement wasn't fully thought out or that there's a lack of communication about expectations. The husband might have a right to feel wronged if the wife is breaking their agreement, but the wife's feelings and consent now matter too.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The wife might feel betrayed or pressured into an agreement she didn't fully commit to. The husband's desire for children is important, but the wife's role in the agreement is key. If she initially agreed but now regrets it, it's a matter of whether the agreement can be revisited. Relationships often require flexibility, so maybe the husband should have discussed this again before proceeding.\n\nHowever, the husband did what he said he would\u2014fulfilling the agreement. The wife's surprise suggests she might not have taken the agreement seriously, which complicates things. The husband's actions could be seen as keeping his word, while the wife is changing her mind. But consent and ongoing communication are crucial in relationships. If the wife is now against the plan, the husband's actions might be considered inconsiderate of her current feelings.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions follow the original agreement, but the wife's change of heart is valid. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether the agreement was binding and if the wife had the right to reconsider. Since the agreement was made mutually but the wife now refuses, it's a conflict of good faith. The husband might be in the right for following through, but the wife's current stance shows a lack of foresight. However, the situation is nuanced, and the husband's actions could be seen as respecting the agreement, so he might not be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the agreement was based on a misunderstanding, he could be at fault. I think the answer hinges on whether the wife's initial agreement was genuine and if the agreement was revisitable. Since the wife is now against it, maybe the husband should have checked in again. But given the information, the author might not be in the wrong, so answer B.\n"
