My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife made an agreement five years ago. Back then, they were both in a relationship where the author was focused on his medical career, and they agreed to have children after he finished his training. The wife didn't want to be a mother and suggested the author have children with others. They made a deal where the author would have children with his friends, he'd provide child support, and not be an active father. The wife, in return, would stay married but not be a mother. Now, the author has two friends who agreed, but the wife is upset and wants to break the agreement. She's appalled that the friends agreed, and the author is considering divorce again. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, the author is expecting the wife to honor a past agreement. But the wife is now changing her mind. The crux here is whether the agreement is valid and if the wife is justified in her reaction. The author might feel wronged because he followed through on his part, but the wife is now backing out. However, agreements between spouses, especially complex ones involving children and relationships, can be ethically murky. \n\nThe wife might argue that the agreement was made under different circumstances, or that she never truly consented in a way that she could commit to such an arrangement long-term. The author's proposal to have children with others while staying married might be seen as a form of arranged open relationship, but with specific conditions. However, the wife's current reaction suggests she wasn't comfortable with the actual execution of the plan once the time came. \n\nFrom a legal perspective, such agreements aren't enforceable in most places, but the moral question is different. The author might believe he's fulfilling his desire for children while keeping the marriage, but the wife's consent might have been based on the hope that circumstances would change or that the author would not go through with it. \n\nThe wife's initial request itself is unusual; she didn't want to be a mother but wanted him to have children with others. That's a significant request, and maybe she didn't anticipate the reality of it. Now, she's upset that he found willing partners. The author might feel the agreement is valid, but the wife's change of heart is complicating things. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife might see herself as being asked to stay in a non-traditional arrangement that she's not comfortable with now. The author might see the agreement as a compromise but not consider the emotional impact on the wife when it's actually happening. The wife's shock and disapproval could indicate that the agreement wasn't as clear as they thought, or that the author didn't fully understand her consent. \n\nAnother angle: the author is using his career as a reason for delaying children, and then later taking drastic steps to have them once the career is established. The wife's role as a bank teller with stable hours might have been a factor in their initial plan, but her own stance on motherhood was a deal-breaker. The agreement they made might not have considered how the wife would feel when the time came to execute it. \n\nThe author's solution of having children with friends while remaining married could be seen as a way to avoid divorce, but it's a complex and potentially harmful arrangement. The wife's current reaction might stem from realizing the implications of the agreement, which could be more than she anticipated. The author might not be wrong in expecting the deal to hold, but he might also be missing the emotional and psychological aspects of the situation. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the validity of the agreement and mutual understanding. If both parties fully understood and agreed to all terms, the author isn't wrong in following through. But if the wife's consent was not genuine or if the agreement wasn't realistic, then the author might be overlooking her current feelings. The answer hinges on whether the agreement was truly mutual and binding. Given the wife's surprise and the complexity of the situation, it's possible the author didn't consider all aspects of her consent, making him partially at fault. But since the user is asking for a choice between A and B, and the situation is complicated, but the author is following through on a prior agreement, maybe the answer is B. However, there's a strong argument that the agreement's ethics are questionable, so A could be the case. Hmm.\n"
