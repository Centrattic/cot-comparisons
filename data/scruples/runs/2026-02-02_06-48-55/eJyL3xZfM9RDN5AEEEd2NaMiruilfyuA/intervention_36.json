My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong after a situation involving an agreement with his wife about having children. The key points here are the initial agreement, the breakdown of that agreement, and the wife's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife discussed children when he was in med school. They agreed that having kids would be postponed until he had a stable 9-5 job. The wife, a bank teller, supported this plan. However, after they married, the wife revealed she didn't want children. The author wanted children, so they considered divorce but opted for an alternative. The solution they came up with was the author having children with other women (friends) while staying married to his wife, with the author not being a father but possibly involved as an uncle.\n\nFast forward five years, the author has found two friends willing to go through with this. But when he informs his wife, she's appalled and says she never expected him to follow through. Now, the author is considering divorce again because the wife is violating their five-year-old agreement.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author in the wrong here?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the wife initially agreed to the plan, but now she's changed her mind. The author is trying to fulfill his desire for children as per their agreement. However, the setup is unconventional and could be seen as ethically problematic. The wife might not have anticipated that he would actually go through with it, and her reaction shows she's uncomfortable with the reality of the situation. \n\nThe author made a deal based on his needs, but relationships require mutual understanding and ongoing consent. Even if they agreed five years ago, people's feelings can change. The wife's discomfort now might indicate that the agreement was made under different circumstances or with different expectations. The author's approach of involving other women could also have implications for trust and emotional well-being in the marriage. \n\nAdditionally, the author's insistence on having children despite his wife's current stance (even if she initially agreed) might not be respecting her boundaries now. The wife could feel used or manipulated if she's expected to go along with a plan she's not comfortable with anymore. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author might argue that they had a mutual agreement, but the wife's reaction suggests that the agreement might not have been fully thought through. The author could be in the wrong for not recognizing that his wife's feelings might change or for not considering the emotional impact on her. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, it's likely that the author is in the wrong because he's pushing a plan that his wife now finds unacceptable, even if they had an initial agreement. Relationships need ongoing communication and respect for each other's current feelings and boundaries.\n"
