My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for expecting his wife to stick to a deal they made five years ago. The deal was that he would have children with other people once he became a doctor, while his wife would not be a mother. Now that he's found two friends who agreed to this arrangement, his wife is upset and wants a divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. They were in a long-term relationship where the author wanted children but his wife didn't. They made an agreement where he would have kids with others, and she wouldn't be a mother. Now, after five years, when he's ready to follow through, she's backing out. \n\nThe author's perspective is that they had a deal, so he's not in the wrong. The wife's perspective is that she never really expected him to go through with it, and she finds it ridiculous. The key here is whether the agreement they made was valid and if both parties understood the terms. \n\nBut wait, agreements in personal relationships, especially regarding such sensitive topics as having children with others, can be tricky. Just because they made a verbal agreement doesn't necessarily mean it's binding. Also, people's feelings and intentions can change over time. The wife might have thought she was being accommodating by agreeing, but now she's realizing it's not something she can live with. \n\nAnother angle: the author's actions could be considered infidelity or emotional betrayal, even if they had an agreement. Having children with others in a committed relationship is generally seen as outside the norms of a monogamous marriage. Even if they consented to it, the wife might feel violated because the reality is different from what she imagined. \n\nAlso, the author is prioritizing his own desire for children over his wife's emotional well-being. He's using her in a way that might not be fair, even if she agreed. The wife might feel used or that the agreement was made under different circumstances or without full understanding. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because the agreement, while mutual at the time, might not account for the wife's changing feelings or the ethical implications of the arrangement. The wife has the right to change her mind, especially if the reality is more impactful than she anticipated. The author's insistence on following through could be seen as disregarding her current feelings and the nature of their relationship.\n"
