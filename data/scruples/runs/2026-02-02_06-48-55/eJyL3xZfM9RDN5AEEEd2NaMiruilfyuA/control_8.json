My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his wife made a deal five years ago about having children. The author wanted kids, the wife didn't. They agreed that when the author became a full-time doctor, he would ask his friends to have his children, with the author providing child support but not being a father. Now, the author has two friends who agreed, but the wife is upset and breaking the agreement. The author is considering divorce again because she's not honoring the deal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and legality of their agreement. The deal they made\u2014where the author would have children with other women while married to his wife\u2014is a bit unconventional. Even though they agreed to it, there might be legal issues. In most places, bigamy or adultery is illegal, and having a child while married could be considered adultery. Also, the wife might not have understood the full implications of the agreement when she agreed five years ago, especially if the situation is now different. She might have felt under pressure or thought it was a hypothetical discussion, not a real plan.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. The wife is now saying she never expected the author to actually follow through. This could indicate that she didn't take the agreement seriously, or that she thought there was a low chance of it happening. The author might have interpreted her agreement as a genuine commitment, but the wife's reaction now suggests she didn't mean it. That's a problem in communication. Maybe they didn't discuss the boundaries or the emotional impact on her. The wife might be feeling betrayed or disrespected, even though they had a prior agreement.\n\nAlso, the author's approach to fulfilling his desire for children through this arrangement could be problematic. It's not just about the agreement; it's about the impact on the wife's emotional well-being. Even if they agreed, the wife has the right to her changing feelings. Five years is a long time, and people can evolve. The wife might have re-evaluated her stance on the agreement and decided she's not comfortable with it anymore. The author's insistence on following through, despite her current objections, could be seen as disregarding her current wishes.\n\nLegally, if the agreement was made without a formal contract, the wife can't be bound by it in court. So the author's expectation that she should honor the deal might be unrealistic. Relationships are based on mutual respect and ongoing consent. If the wife now objects, the author has a responsibility to respect her feelings, even if it means revisiting the agreement.\n\nMoreover, the author's solution involves using friends as sperm donors, which could have social and ethical implications. The friends involved might have different expectations or face their own issues once the situation becomes real. Additionally, the children born from this arrangement would have complex family dynamics, which the author might not have fully considered.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author might have been in a vulnerable position five years ago, trying to maintain the marriage while prioritizing his career and desire for children. But now, the wife's feelings have changed, and the author's rigid adherence to the old agreement might be inflexible. The key issue is whether both parties are still comfortable with the terms. Since the wife is now distressed and wants the agreement to be void, the author should reconsider pushing forward. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's current feelings and the agreement's validity over time. Relationships require ongoing communication and adjustment, and holding someone to an old agreement when they no longer agree can be harmful. The author's insistence on proceeding despite the wife's objections shows a lack of respect for her current wishes, which is a key factor in determining fault here.\n"
