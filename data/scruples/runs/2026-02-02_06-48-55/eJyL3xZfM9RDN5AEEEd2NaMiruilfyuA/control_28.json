My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me start by breaking down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife made a five-year-old agreement where they would have children through third parties because the wife doesn't want to be a mother. The author is a doctor who wanted to pass on his genes, and the wife agreed to this plan. Now, when the time comes, the wife is upset and wants to avoid the arranged surrogacy with their friends.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to stick to the agreement. The wife is now appalled that the author found friends willing to go through with it. She claims she never truly intended to agree to this and is surprised they found willing participants. The author feels betrayed because he thought they had a deal, and now the wife is reneging on it.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, I don't think there's a legal contract here. Marital agreements aren't enforceable unless they're formalized, like a prenup, which isn't mentioned. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting the agreement to hold, but without a legal document, it's more about expectations and mutual consent.\n\nEthically and emotionally, it's more complex. The wife initially agreed to the plan, but maybe she didn't fully consider the implications. The author believed they had a mutual understanding, so from his perspective, it's a broken promise. However, the wife's current reaction suggests she might not have been serious about the agreement. That could mean the author was naive in expecting her to follow through, especially since emotions and feelings can change over time. \n\nThe author's plan involves having children with other people, which could have significant emotional and psychological impacts. The wife might not have realized how much this would affect her, and now she's in a dilemma. The author's expectation that the wife would honor the agreement might be unrealistic because people can change their minds, especially on such a personal matter.\n\nAdditionally, the solution they came up with involves a third party, which might not be as straightforward as they thought. The wife's surprise that friends agreed might indicate that she didn't foresee the social or emotional consequences, which she now finds unacceptable. The author's insistence on going through with the plan despite her change of heart could be seen as ignoring her current feelings and needs.\n\nIn terms of fairness, both parties might have valid points. The author thought they had a clear agreement, but the wife's feelings have evolved. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the agreement to hold. Since the wife is now opposing the plan, the author might be in a position where he's not respecting her changed wishes, even if they had a prior agreement. Relationships require ongoing communication and mutual respect for each other's evolving needs. If the wife is now against the plan, the author might need to reconsider pushing forward, which would mean he's at fault for not acknowledging her current stance.\n\nAnother angle is the initial decision-making process. When they made the agreement, the wife might not have fully considered the implications, or the author might not have realized how much this issue mattered to her. Now, with the situation escalating, the author is holding onto an agreement that the wife is no longer comfortable with. This could be seen as the author being inflexible, which would put him in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had a valid expectation based on their prior agreement, the wife's changed feelings must be respected. The author might be in the wrong for not recognizing her current position and pushing forward despite her opposition. So the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
