My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The key points to consider are the agreement made five years ago and the wife's current reaction to it.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife originally agreed that the author would become a full-time physician first, and once that was achieved, he would find other women to have children with, while the wife would be the mother. The plan was that the author wouldn't be the father, just an uncle. Now, after five years, the author has found two friends willing to participate, but the wife is upset and wants to cancel the agreement.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for expecting the wife to honor the five-year-old deal. The wife's argument is that she didn't expect her husband to actually go through with it, and she's appalled that he found others. The author believes the agreement is still valid and that the wife is breaking it now.\n\nI need to consider if the agreement was a legitimate one that both parties understood and accepted. The wife's objection might stem from a change in her feelings or a realization that the original deal was unrealistic. However, the author might argue that they both agreed to the terms at the time. \n\nBut looking deeper, the agreement involves the wife having children with other men while the author isn't the father, which raises ethical concerns. The wife might have felt pressured into the agreement when she was in a vulnerable position (being with someone in med school), and perhaps didn't foresee the emotional impact. Also, the author's desire for his genes to continue doesn't necessarily mean the wife is wrong to reconsider.\n\nThe wife's reaction now could be due to realizing the deal's implications or feeling manipulated. The author's insistence on following through, despite her current objections, might be the issue. Even if they agreed before, relationships can evolve, and both parties should respect each other's current feelings.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for expecting the wife to stick to an agreement she now finds unacceptable. The wife's change of heart could be valid, especially if the original deal wasn't in her best interest or if she didn't fully consider the long-term effects. The key is mutual respect and understanding, not strict adherence to an old agreement if one party is now uncomfortable.\n"
