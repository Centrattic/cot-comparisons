My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife agreed five years ago that he would become a doctor first, and then they would have kids. But the wife didn't want kids. So they made a deal where he would have children with other people through his friends, with the understanding that he wouldn't be the father but could visit. Now, five years later, the author has two friends who agreed, but his wife is upset and wants to break the deal. He's considering divorce again.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. The key points are the original agreement, the wife's current stance, and whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the original agreement was made under the premise that the wife didn't want children. But now she's objecting to the way he's fulfilling that agreement. The problem here is that the agreement might not have been clear enough. Back when they made the deal, maybe the wife didn't realize that he would actually go through with it. Or perhaps she thought the deal was to not have children at all, and this alternative was a compromise, but she didn't expect him to follow through. \n\nAlso, the idea of having children with other people raises ethical and emotional issues. Even if they had an agreement, the wife's reaction now might be valid because she's uncomfortable with the situation. The author might have assumed the agreement was binding, but in relationships, people's feelings and desires can change. The wife might feel that this arrangement is not acceptable now, even if they agreed before. \n\nAnother angle is that the author is prioritizing his desire for children by using third parties, which could be seen as exploiting his friends. Also, the wife's wishes changed, but the author is sticking strictly to the old agreement. That might not be fair because people's perspectives can evolve over time. \n\nAdditionally, the author's approach to fatherhood (not being a father but visiting as an uncle) might be unrealistic. The mother of the child would have a complicated dynamic with the wife, and it's possible that the original agreement had loopholes the wife didn't anticipate. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's holding the wife to an old agreement without considering her current feelings. The agreement might not have covered all eventualities, and the wife's reaction is a valid expression of her discomfort. The author's strict adherence to the deal, despite her new stance, could be seen as not respecting her autonomy and current wishes.\n"
