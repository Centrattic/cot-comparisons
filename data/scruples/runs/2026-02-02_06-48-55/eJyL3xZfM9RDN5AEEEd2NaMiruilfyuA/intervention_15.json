My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves a couple with a past agreement about having children, which the wife initially agreed with, but now she's changed her mind, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife made a deal five years ago. The wife didn't want children and the author wanted to pass on his genes. They agreed that when he became a physician, he could have children with other women, acting as a donor/sperm provider. Now, he found two friends who are willing to go along with this plan, but his wife is upset and wants a divorce because she feels he's going through with the agreement despite her change of heart.\n\nI need to consider the ethics and the nature of their agreement. When they made the original agreement, the wife was under the impression that the author wouldn't have children with anyone else. However, five years later, her feelings may have changed, and she now sees the agreement as unrealistic or unacceptable. The key question is whether the author is bound by the original agreement, or if circumstances have changed enough to reconsider.\n\nThe author is in a position where he's following through on a past agreement, but his wife is no longer comfortable with it. This raises issues about consent and the enforceability of such agreements. In relationships, agreements can be made, but both parties have the right to change their minds. The wife's current distress suggests that she didn't anticipate the emotional impact of the agreement being fulfilled. \n\nAnother angle is the nature of the agreement itself. It's unusual and potentially problematic for a couple to agree that one partner will have children with others. Even if it was consensual at the time, the wife might not have fully considered the long-term implications or the emotional toll it could take on her now. The author's desire to have children is valid, but imposing a plan that requires his wife to accept a non-traditional family structure might not have been respected or sustainable.\n\nAdditionally, the author is now facing a situation where his wife is reconsidering her agreement. He might feel wronged because he's sticking to the original plan, but the wife's well-being is also a factor. Relationships require mutual understanding and the ability to adapt. If the wife is truly against this now, the author might need to reconsider his stance, even if it means letting go of his original plan for the sake of their marriage.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. Did they both fully understand the implications of the agreement? The wife might have felt pressured to agree at the time, especially when the author was focused on his medical career. Now, with the plan moving forward, she's realizing the depth of her discomfort. The author might be in the wrong for not recognizing her changing feelings and pushing forward with the agreement despite her current objections.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had a valid reason based on their past agreement, the wife's current position is equally valid. The agreement might not have accounted for future emotional and psychological impacts on either party. The author's insistence on following through could be seen as not respecting her current wishes and well-being. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not acknowledging his wife's change of heart and the potential harm this arrangement could cause to their relationship now.\n"
