My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. \n\nFirst, the author and his wife made a deal five years ago where she didn't want children, and he wanted to have them. To resolve this, they agreed that he would have children with other women while staying married. Now, after five years, when he's ready and found two friends willing to participate, his wife backs out. He's upset because he thought they had an agreement.\n\nHmm. Let me think about the key points here. The original agreement was based on conflicting desires about children. The wife didn't want kids, but the husband did. So they made a compromise where he would have children with others, and they would stay married. But now, she's changing her mind. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for expecting her to stick to the agreement? Well, agreements between people can be valid, but they also need mutual consent. However, this situation is unusual because it involves having children with others while in a marriage. That might not be legally binding or ethically sound in many societies. Also, emotions and circumstances can change over time. Maybe the wife realized the implications of the agreement and doesn't want to go through with it. \n\nAlso, the wife's initial agreement was based on her not wanting to be a mother and the husband wanting to have children. But the compromise he's proposing might not be something she fully considered at the time. Perhaps she didn't anticipate the emotional impact or the social implications of her husband having children with others. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband believes they made a deal, so he's expecting her to honor it. But if the agreement involved something that's against societal norms or her personal values, she might have a right to reconsider. \n\nAnother angle: the original problem was about their differing views on children. By making this agreement, they were trying to meet in the middle. However, the solution proposed by the wife (having him have children with others) is a non-traditional and possibly harmful arrangement. It's possible that the wife's agreement was under pressure or not fully thought out. \n\nAlso, in many relationships, such an agreement could be seen as a betrayal of trust, even if both parties initially agreed. The husband's proposal might not be something that's acceptable in the long term for either of them. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong if the agreement was not binding and if the wife is now reconsidering her stance. People can change their minds, especially when it comes to such a significant and personal matter. The author expected her to stick to the agreement, but maybe he was too rigid. The wife's change of heart could be valid because the situation is more complex than just a simple contract. \n\nAdditionally, the husband's approach of having children with others might not be something that the wife can ethically or emotionally support later. So the author's expectation that she honor the agreement might not take into account her current feelings and the reality of the situation. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
