My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation he described. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author and his wife initially agreed that they would have children after he finished his medical training. Later, the wife confessed she doesn't want to be a mother. The author wants children for his family line. They agreed that in five years, he would have his friends (friends who want to have his children) take care of it, with financial support but no father role. Now, the wife is upset that the plan worked out, and the author is considering divorce again because she's breaking the agreement.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author wrong for expecting the wife to stick to the deal? Let's break down the components. \n\nThe original agreement was made under certain circumstances. The wife's stance changed over time. The author proceeded with a plan that he thought they agreed on, but the wife now feels differently. Marital agreements can be tricky, especially when emotions and personal values change. \n\nThe wife might feel that the initial agreement was made under pressure or during a different phase of their relationship. Also, the author's plan involves creating children with others, which is ethically complex and might not be something the wife actually consented to in the long term. People's feelings can evolve, and what was acceptable five years ago might not be now. \n\nMoreover, the author's approach to fulfilling his desire for children through this arrangement might be seen as putting his needs above the wife's current feelings, even if she initially agreed. The wife might have not fully considered the emotional implications at the time, or she might feel that the author didn't fully understand her position when they made the deal.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is following through on an agreement they had. He's trying to honor his commitment to have children, which is important to him. The wife's change of heart could be seen as breaking the original deal. However, relationships require mutual respect and communication. If the wife's feelings have genuinely changed, the author might need to accommodate that, but he might feel that his own needs are valid too.\n\nBut, the core issue is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the wife to stick to the deal. The wife's reaction suggests that the agreement might not have been as clear or binding as the author thought. Maybe there were assumptions made that weren't discussed in depth. The author's plan also seems unconventional and might have ethical issues beyond just the marital agreement. The wife's shock and refusal to accept the plan now could indicate that the initial agreement wasn't a solid commitment she was ready to uphold long-term.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the wife's current stance reflects her present feelings, and the author's insistence on following through might overlook her current well-being and the complexity of the arrangement. The author might be in the wrong if the agreement was based on mutual misunderstanding or if the wife didn't fully commit to it in the long term. Alternatively, if there was a clear, mutual agreement, the author isn't necessarily wrong for expecting her to follow through. But given the circumstances, it's more likely that the wife's change in perspective is valid, making the author's expectation unreasonable now.\n"
