My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the author and his wife made a deal five years ago where he would become a father through surrogacy or something similar with friends, and the wife agreed. Now, when he goes ahead with the plan, she refuses to go along with it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a doctor who had always planned to have kids after completing his education. His wife, however, never wanted children and wanted him to change his mind. When he didn't, they considered divorce but made a compromise where he would have children with other people while staying married. The wife agreed to this five years ago, but now she's backing out when he actually finds people willing to go through with it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but there's a nuance here. The agreement was made under the understanding that the wife would not be the mother, and the author wouldn't be a father, just an uncle. The wife's current reaction seems to be a change of heart. But legally and ethically, can you expect someone to stick to such an agreement? The author might have thought he was being fair, but the wife's feelings might have changed, or she didn't realize people would actually agree. \n\nBut wait, the author is now going through with it, and the wife is against it now. The problem here is whether the initial agreement was valid and if the wife is entitled to back out. Also, the author's plan involves his friends being the mothers, which could have implications for the friends' willingness and the legal aspects of surrogacy. However, the main issue is the breach of the agreement.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author might be in the wrong if the agreement was not a binding one and the wife's consent was given under different circumstances. However, if they had a mutual agreement and the wife is breaking it now, she might be at fault. But emotions and relationships can complicate this. The author's reasoning that he loves his wife and wants to stay with her despite her not wanting kids is a factor. But now he's pursuing his goal through an unconventional method, which the wife didn't anticipate.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's initial agreement might have been a temporary solution to avoid divorce, not a long-term plan. She might not have realized the reality of the situation when he actually found people willing to go through with it. The author, in following through, is enforcing the agreement, but the wife feels betrayed. It's a matter of whether the agreement was realistic and if both parties truly understood the implications.\n\nIn terms of ethics, having children with others while remaining married to someone who doesn't want children is a complex situation. The author might be prioritizing his own desire for children over his wife's emotional well-being. Even if they agreed to the plan, the act of proceeding without considering her current feelings could be seen as wrong. Also, the fact that the wife is appalled suggests that the arrangement didn't fully address her emotional needs or expectations.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's enforcing an agreement that his wife now sees as unrealistic or harmful. The agreement was made in a specific context, and her change of heart now could be valid. The author's focus on his own desires without considering her current feelings might make him at fault. Therefore, Answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) seems appropriate.\n"
