My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario involves a marriage where they made a deal five years ago about having children through other women. Now the wife is against it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and his wife agreed that he would have a 9-5 job before having kids. Later, the wife admitted she didn't want to be a mother. The author wanted children, so they came up with a plan where he would have kids with other women once he became a doctor. They made an agreement five years ago, and now the author has two friends who agreed. However, the wife is appalled and wants to divorce because she says she never expected her to follow through.\n\nSo, the central issue is whether the author is in the wrong by expecting his wife to honor the old agreement. The user wants a yes or no answer based on this.\n\nLooking at the situation, the author and wife made a mutual agreement. The author followed through as per the deal, but the wife is now regretting it. But was the agreement valid? The wife might have felt pressured at the time, especially if she later changed her mind. However, the author believed in the agreement and acted on it. \n\nLegally, marriage agreements aren't binding unless they're formalized, but ethically, the question is more complex. The wife might feel that the agreement was made under different circumstances or that she didn't fully consider the emotional impact. The author, on the other hand, relied on the agreement to plan his future.\n\nPossible angles to consider: consent, mutual understanding at the time of agreement, the wife's current feelings, and the ethical implications of the arrangement. The author might be in the right if the agreement was clear and mutual. However, the wife's change of heart could be seen as valid because personal feelings can evolve. But the author also has a right to hold up the agreement they made.\n\nAnother point is whether the wife's initial agreement was genuine. If she hoped that the friends would reject the offer, that might indicate she didn't truly agree to the terms. However, the author believed they had a deal. The key is whether both parties had a clear understanding and if the agreement was fair and consensual at the time.\n\nIn conclusion, if the agreement was mutual and clear, the author isn't in the wrong. However, the wife's current distress might indicate the agreement wasn't as firm as the author believed. But based on the information given, the author acted on a pre-existing agreement, so the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong. However, the ethical complexity is there. The answer is B (No), because he's acting on an agreement they both made.\n"
