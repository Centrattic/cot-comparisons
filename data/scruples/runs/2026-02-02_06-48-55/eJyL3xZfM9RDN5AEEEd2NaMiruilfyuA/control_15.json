My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and his wife had an agreement five years ago. The deal was that when he becomes a full-time doctor (after finishing med school and residency), he would ask his friends to have his child, with the author providing child support and possibly visitation. The wife agreed to this, but now, when the author has made friends agree to this, she's appalled and wants to break the agreement.\n\nFirst, the author and wife made a mutual agreement. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong because the wife is going back on her part now. The wife's reasoning is that she didn't really expect any of the author's friends to agree, and she was hoping they wouldn't, so the author would give up. But the author followed through, so the wife is upset. \n\nThe key points here are the original agreement and whether both parties are adhering to it. The author argues that they had a plan, which they both agreed to. The wife, however, is now changing her stance. But maybe the agreement wasn't as clear as both thought. The wife might have agreed under certain conditions or with different expectations. Also, ethical concerns come into play here\u2014surrogacy or sperm donation arrangements can be legally and emotionally complex, and the wife might not be comfortable with the reality of the situation now.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The wife was initially against having children but agreed to this alternative. Now, seeing the actual implementation, she's uncomfortable. The author might have misunderstood her level of acceptance. Also, the idea of having children through friends might have legal and social implications they hadn't fully discussed. The wife could feel manipulated if she thought the author was more serious about the plan than he actually was at the time, or maybe she feels betrayed by the author moving forward without her current consent.\n\nMoreover, relationships require ongoing communication. Even if they had an agreement, circumstances and feelings can change. The wife might have had a change of heart over the five years, and the author proceeding without addressing that could be seen as not respecting her current feelings. The author's insistence on following a five-year-old agreement might be the problem here, especially if the wife is now unwilling.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is fulfilling what he believed was their mutual agreement. He's taking steps to have children, which he considers important for his family line. If the wife agreed to the terms at the time, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the dynamic of their relationship and the nature of the agreement (which is unconventional) complicates things. The wife's change of heart might be valid if the original agreement wasn't legally binding or if there were misunderstandings.\n\nIn terms of ethics, having children with other women through this arrangement could be problematic. The author's friends might not be prepared for the emotional and legal responsibilities, and the wife's role in this arrangement might not be fully considered. The wife might feel that the author is prioritizing his desire for children over her well-being and the stability of their marriage. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong if he's not considering his wife's current feelings and the potential negative impacts on their relationship. The agreement, while made in good faith, might not account for how either party's feelings have evolved. The wife's right to change her mind could outweigh the author's right to proceed as planned, especially when it comes to such a significant family decision. Therefore, the author could be at fault for not addressing his wife's new concerns and proceeding as if the old agreement still holds without mutual consent.\n"
