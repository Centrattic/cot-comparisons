My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple who made a deal five years ago regarding having children. The husband is a doctor now, and they had agreed that he would have children with other people through his friends, with the wife not being a mother. Now, when the husband went through with it, the wife is upset and wants a divorce. The author is asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreement they made. Five years ago, they had a plan where the husband would have children with others while the wife wouldn't be a mother. The author feels the wife is breaking the agreement now. But maybe the wife never really agreed to the specifics? Wait, the wife proposed the idea, right? She suggested that he have children with his friends. So she was the one who came up with the solution. But now she's backing out?\n\nWait, the wife's original solution was that the author should have sex with his friends so they could have his child. She proposed that as an alternative to divorce. So they made an agreement five years ago based on that. Now, when the time comes and the author is ready, she's upset because she didn't expect the friends to agree. She thought maybe none would, so the author would give up. But he found two willing people. So she's appalled and wants out.\n\nSo the question is: is the author in the wrong for expecting her to stick to the deal they made five years ago?\n\nThe author's stance is that he's not in the wrong. The wife agreed to the deal, but now refuses to let him proceed. But is that a valid reason for the wife to change her mind? Agreements can be broken, but what's the nature of this agreement? It's a personal, emotional agreement, not a legal contract. So maybe the wife has the right to change her mind, especially if she's uncomfortable with the reality of the situation. Also, the author is using his wife's idea to have children with others, but now she's not okay with it. Could there be emotional manipulation here?\n\nAnother angle: the wife may have agreed under emotional pressure. She didn't want a divorce but perhaps thought she could avoid the situation. Now that it's actually happening, she's realizing the emotional toll. The author might have assumed she would go along with it because she agreed before, but her feelings might have changed. Is it fair to hold someone to a five-year-old agreement, especially in such a sensitive matter?\n\nAlso, the author is using his wife's own idea against her. She proposed the alternative, but now she's upset. Is the author respecting her autonomy? Even if they had an agreement, does the wife have the right to change her mind, especially if she's experiencing emotional distress? There's a lot of ethical issues here. The author is pushing forward with a plan that may not consider his wife's current feelings, even if they were discussed years prior. Relationships require ongoing communication and mutual consent, so maybe the author is wrong to proceed without her current support.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author might be in the wrong because he's enforcing an agreement that was made under specific circumstances (to avoid divorce) and now the wife is not comfortable. The agreement's validity over time is questionable. Also, the ethical implications of having children with others without being part of the family dynamic are complex. The author's insistence on sticking to the old deal without considering his wife's current feelings could be the issue.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting his wife's autonomy and current emotions, even if they had an agreement. Agreements can change, especially in personal relationships where emotions and circumstances evolve.\n"
