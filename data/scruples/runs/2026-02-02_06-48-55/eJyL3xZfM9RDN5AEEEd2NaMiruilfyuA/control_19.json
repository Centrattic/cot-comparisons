My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his wife made an agreement five years ago. The author wanted kids but didn't want his wife to have them because she didn't. So they made a plan where he would have children with other people when he became a doctor, and his wife would support that. Now, five years later, the author has found two friends who agreed to this arrangement, but his wife is upset and wants a divorce because she didn't expect him to actually go through with it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. Both parties agreed to it, so the author is following through on his part. But wait, maybe the agreement was misunderstood or not fully thought through. The wife says she never expected him to actually find people willing to do this. That raises a question about mutual understanding. Did the wife really agree to this, or was she just trying to avoid a divorce and not thinking it through?\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that he wants to pass on his genes and he's an only child. But the wife's stance is that she doesn't want to be a mother. The compromise was allowing him to have kids through other women. However, when he actually found people, she's against it now. That seems like a breach of their agreement, but maybe the agreement wasn't binding or clear enough.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. The wife might feel betrayed even though they had a plan. Maybe she wasn't expecting the author to go through with it so seriously. The author might have assumed the agreement was solid, but the wife's reaction suggests she didn't take it as seriously. So who's at fault here?\n\nLegally, this might not be a matter of right or wrong, but in terms of personal relationships, breaking an agreement can be seen as wrong. However, if the agreement was made under duress (like to avoid divorce), then maybe the wife isn't in the wrong. Also, the author's idea of having children with others might have ethical issues, even if both agreed. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the ethics of the arrangement.\n\nThe key points are: both agreed to the plan, the author followed through, but the wife is now against it. If the agreement was mutual and clear, the wife is breaking it by opposing it. But if the agreement was made without full understanding or under pressure, then the author might be wrong for expecting her to stick to it. However, the author believed they had an agreement, so he might think he's not in the wrong. The wife's surprise suggests she didn't take the agreement as seriously, which could make her the one in the wrong. But maybe the author should have checked in with her more often instead of assuming she'd go along with it. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. I think the main issue is whether both parties had the same understanding of the agreement. If the wife truly agreed and the author did as agreed, then he's not in the wrong. But if the agreement was ambiguous or the wife didn't really mean it, then maybe the author is in the wrong for not considering her feelings. However, the story says they worked out the details and made the agreement five years ago. So the author isn't wrong for following through on a mutual agreement. The wife is now going back on it. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted because the wife's reaction is valid if the agreement was misunderstood. But based on the info given, the author did what he agreed to, so he's not in the wrong.\n"
