My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his wife made an agreement five years ago. The author wanted children, but his wife didn't. To resolve this, they came up with a deal where the author would have children with his friends (not the wife) once he became a full physician. Now, he's in the position where he can do that, but the wife is upset and wants to break up the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was in med school when they met, and the original plan was to wait until he finished residency for children. The wife agreed to that. Then, when she confessed she didn't want to be a mother, they made a new agreement. The author wanted to pass on his genes, so he proposed this alternative solution. The wife agreed to this plan five years ago, so she was on board at the time.\n\nNow, the problem is that the wife is backing out of that agreement. She's appalled that the author's friends agreed to this arrangement. The author is upset because she's not following through on their mutual agreement. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting her to stick to the deal.\n\nI need to think about consent and the nature of agreements. When they made the agreement five years ago, both parties agreed. If the wife is now changing her mind, that might be a breach of the agreement. However, there's also the aspect of consent over time. People's views can change, even if they agreed in the past. The wife might have realized that the agreement was a mistake or that she couldn't live with the consequences.\n\nAnother angle is the ethical implications of the agreement itself. Having children with other people while married to someone who does not want to be a mother is complex. The author is not being a father to the children, but the arrangement still involves polyamory or some form of non-traditional relationship. The wife might feel that the agreement was made under certain circumstances (like the stress of the author's medical career) and that she didn't fully consider the long-term implications.\n\nAlso, the author is using his wife's resources for child support, which the wife agreed to pay. But if the wife is now opposing the plan, it could be because she feels exploited or that the agreement was not fair in the long run. She might have agreed under different emotional or financial circumstances.\n\nIn relationships, agreements are important, but so is ongoing communication and mutual consent. If the wife feels that the agreement is no longer acceptable to her, even if it was made in good faith, the author might need to respect her current feelings. However, the author might feel that breaking the agreement is unfair because he relied on it to make plans (like his career) and he's now in a position to fulfill it.\n\nThere's also the question of whether the agreement was a legal contract. Since it's a personal relationship, it's likely just a verbal agreement. Verbal agreements can be harder to enforce, especially if one party changes their mind. The wife might not be legally bound, but the emotional aspect is still significant.\n\nAnother point is the author's reasoning for wanting children. He mentions wanting to pass on his genes and keep his family line alive. That's a personal value, but the wife's values are also important. The wife's right to not be a mother is a key point here. The author might feel that the agreement respects her wishes while fulfilling his own, but the wife might now see it as a violation of her boundaries.\n\nIn summary, the author is in a difficult position where he made an agreement to resolve a conflict with his wife. However, the wife is now changing her stance, and the author feels wronged because he expected her to stick to the deal. The question is whether the wife's change of heart is a valid reason to break the agreement, considering her feelings and the ethical implications of the arrangement.\n"
