My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife made a deal five years ago. Back then, they agreed that the author would become a doctor, and when he was established, he could have children with other women while the wife wouldn't be a mother. The wife's condition was that she didn't want to be a mother, and the author wanted to have kids. So they came to this agreement where the wife would stay married but not be the mother, and the author would have children through other women once he was a doctor.\n\nNow, five years later, the author has become a doctor and found two friends willing to have children with him. But when he tells his wife, she's appalled and says she never expected him to go through with it. She's now suggesting divorce again, claiming she didn't really mean the agreement and thought he would give up. The author is upset because he thought they had a valid agreement.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is wrong here. Let's consider the key points. The agreement was made under specific circumstances. The wife at the time agreed to this arrangement, possibly to stay married. However, agreements in relationships can be tricky. They might be made under pressure or emotional circumstances and not fully considered. Also, when the author goes to execute the agreement, the wife changes her stance. Is that his fault?\n\nAnother angle: The wife's current reaction might indicate that she didn't fully commit to the agreement. Maybe she thought it was a temporary solution or that the author wouldn't actually follow through. The author, on the other hand, took it seriously and acted on it. Now that the situation has changed, who is at fault?\n\nLegally, agreements between married couples aren't typically enforceable unless in a prenuptial agreement or similar legal document. So the wife might not be bound by the agreement legally, but ethically? That's where it gets murky. The author might believe he was justified in following through with the deal they made, but the wife might feel betrayed because she didn't anticipate the actual execution.\n\nAlso, consider emotional aspects. The wife might have agreed under the belief that the author would eventually change his mind or that the friends wouldn't agree. The author might have acted in good faith, but the wife's feelings now are valid. The agreement was about the wife not wanting to be a mother, but the author's actions could be seen as using her for his own desires while she's not part of the parenting. That could be a point against the author.\n\nBut the author also wanted to pass on his genes and mentioned being an only child. He might feel that the agreement was necessary for his fulfillment. However, the wife's current reaction shows that maybe the agreement wasn't as firm as he thought. Did he overstep by going ahead with it when she's now objecting? Or is he justified in fulfilling the deal they made?\n\nAnother point: The author is planning to have children with other women while remaining married. This is a non-traditional arrangement and could be seen as infidelity or a breach of trust, even if they agreed. The wife might feel that the agreement was made in a specific context and that the author is now acting on it without considering her current feelings.\n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong because the agreement might not have been a mutual, binding commitment. The wife's change of heart could indicate that the agreement was not a solid foundation for the future. The author's actions could be seen as not respecting his wife's current wishes, even if they made a deal in the past. Relationships can change, and what was agreed upon years ago might not hold up when new emotions or circumstances arise. The wife might not be bound by that old agreement if she's now reconsidering it. Therefore, the author might be acting against her current wishes, making him at fault.\n"
