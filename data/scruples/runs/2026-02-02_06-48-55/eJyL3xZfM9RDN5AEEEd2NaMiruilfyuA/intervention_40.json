My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's in a medical career, and his wife made an agreement five years ago. The agreement was that the author would have children through his friends, not with his wife, because she doesn't want to be a mother. Now, five years later, the author has two friends who agreed, but his wife is upset and wants to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the timeline. They made an agreement when they were both in a certain place in their lives. The wife was a bank teller, the author was in med school. They agreed that when he finished school, he could have children with others, and she wouldn't be the mother. The problem now is that the wife is changing her position and not honoring the deal. \n\nBut why would she change her mind? The author says she was appalled that his friends agreed. Maybe she didn't realize how feasible it would be? She might have thought that the author wouldn't find anyone willing to go along with this plan. The author, on the other hand, thought they had a clear agreement, so he followed through when the time came. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for expecting her to stick to the agreement? Well, agreements between people, especially in a marriage, can be complex. But they made this deal under specific circumstances. The wife's stance has changed, and she's now upset about the outcome. Maybe she didn't fully realize the implications at the time, or perhaps the author didn't understand her feelings. \n\nAlso, the way the author approached the situation\u2014using friends to have children without the wife's ongoing consent\u2014might be problematic. Even if they had an agreement, the emotional and ethical aspects of this arrangement could be a point of contention. The wife might feel betrayed, even if there was an agreement. The author might have assumed the agreement was solid, but the wife's feelings have evolved. \n\nAnother angle: the agreement itself. Was it a legal contract, or just a verbal understanding? In marriage, agreements are typically verbal and can be subjective. The wife might not think it's binding anymore, especially if her feelings have changed. The author's assumption that she would honor a five-year-old verbal agreement could be naive, given the emotional complexities of such a situation.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about wanting to pass on his genes and being an only child adds a layer. But the wife's decision not to be a mother was a dealbreaker for him, leading to the divorce threat. Now, when the situation is possible, she's against it. It's a conflict of values and expectations.\n\nIn summary, the author's main issue is expecting his wife to stick to an old agreement without considering that her feelings and the reality might have changed. While they had an agreement, the emotional and ethical dimensions of the situation might not have been fully considered, leading to the current conflict. The wife's change of heart could be valid if the author didn't account for the possibility of evolving emotions and circumstances. So, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing that the agreement's context could change over time.\n"
