My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife made a deal five years ago. The deal was that he would have a child with someone else while they stay married, so he can pass on his genes. The wife agreed to this back then, and the author went ahead and found two friends who are willing to have his child. Now, he's upset because his wife is appalled and doesn't want to go through with the deal anymore. He's considering divorce again.\n\nHmm. So the key here is whether the wife is bound by the original agreement. But agreements like this, especially in personal relationships, can be tricky. Even if they made a deal when they were together, emotions and circumstances can change over time. The wife might have agreed under certain conditions, but now she's changed her mind. \n\nWait, but why would she agree to such a deal in the first place? Maybe she didn't really consider the emotional impact or the complexity of the situation. The author is now expecting her to stick to the agreement, but he's also the one who proposed the idea as a way to avoid divorce. However, the wife now finds it unacceptable. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for needing children is about passing on his genes and keeping his family line. But the wife never wanted children, so this compromise was a way to keep their marriage. Now, she's realizing that this compromise isn't something she can live with. \n\nAnother angle: the original agreement might have been a temporary solution to avoid divorce, but both parties might have different long-term views. The wife might not have fully committed to that plan, and the author might have expected her to follow through without considering her feelings now. \n\nAdditionally, the author is using friends for this arrangement, which raises ethical concerns. Even if the friends agreed, it's a complex dynamic. The author's friends might not have considered all the long-term implications either. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might have been wrong to put such a pressure on his wife and friends. He might not have considered that his wife's consent could change over time. Relationships involve ongoing communication and mutual respect, so if the wife is now uncomfortable with the arrangement, it's important to address that. \n\nThe author's initial shock and heartbreak when his wife confessed not wanting children shows that he was invested in the agreement. But now, the wife is the one who's having a change of heart, and the author is upset because she's breaking their deal. However, people's feelings can evolve, and what was an acceptable solution at one time might not be later. \n\nI think the author is partly responsible here. By proposing such an unconventional arrangement, he might have underestimated how difficult it would be for his wife to go along with it long-term. The wife is now voicing her true feelings, which is a valid response. The author might be in the wrong for expecting her to stick to a deal that was made under specific circumstances and not revisiting it as their lives changed.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
