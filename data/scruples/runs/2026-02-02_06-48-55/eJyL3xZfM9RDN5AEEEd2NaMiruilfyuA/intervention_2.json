My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife had a deal five years ago. The deal was that since the author was in medical school and wanted to have children later when he had a stable job, and the wife didn't want to be a mother, they agreed that the author would eventually have children with other people. The wife would provide child support and visit the children as an uncle if allowed, but he wouldn't be the father. Now, five years later, the author has two friends who agreed to this arrangement, but his wife is upset and wants a divorce now because she didn't expect the friends to agree.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting the wife to stick to their five-year-old agreement. Let me think about the key points here.\n\nFirst, the wife agreed to the deal at the time, but maybe she misunderstood the implications. When they made the agreement, maybe they didn't fully consider how she would feel if the author actually followed through. The wife's current reaction might indicate that she didn't expect the friends to agree, so maybe she thought the plan was a hypothetical that wouldn't come to fruition.\n\nAlso, the author is a medical professional, but this situation is more about personal ethics and relationships. The wife's main issue is that she never wanted to be a mother and now the author is going to have children with others, which she finds unacceptable. Even though they had an agreement, the wife's feelings might not have been fully considered. The author might be prioritizing his desire for children over his wife's emotional well-being now that the plan is becoming real.\n\nAnother angle: agreements between spouses about such personal and life-changing decisions can be complex. Even if they made a deal, people's feelings and perspectives can change over time. The wife might have realized that she's not okay with her husband having children with others, even if it was part of an agreement. The author might be assuming that her commitment to the agreement is absolute, but her current reaction shows that she wasn't fully on board, or maybe didn't realize the emotional impact until it's a reality.\n\nAlso, the wife's suggestion that the author have children with others seems extreme. Is that a reasonable solution to their differing desires? It's possible that the author is being too literal about the agreement, not considering the emotional aspect for his wife. Even if they made an agreement, the wife's feelings now matter. Maybe she felt she had no other choice back then because she didn't want a divorce, but now she's reconsidering.\n\nMoreover, the author's reasoning that he can't love another woman as much as his wife might not be a valid justification for the current arrangement. He's entering into a situation where he's having children with other people, which is a significant commitment and could affect his relationship with his wife. It's possible that the wife feels betrayed because the plan was to have children, but the method involves her not being the mother, which she never wanted, and now she's being asked to accept him having children with others, which is a different scenario than she might have imagined.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might be in the wrong because he's expecting his wife to uphold an agreement that she might not have fully understood the implications of, or because he's not considering her current feelings. The agreement was made under specific circumstances (his medical school and career plans), but the wife's stance on motherhood is a key part of her identity. By proceeding, the author might be disregarding her autonomy and emotional well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did try to compromise by not being the legal father and offering child support. He also considered his wife's wishes by not wanting to be a father and allowing her to stay in the marriage. But the problem is that the wife now feels the agreement was unrealistic and she didn't expect the friends to agree, so she's not okay with it. The author's actions might be seen as going against the spirit of the agreement, even if the letter of the agreement was followed.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because he's enforcing an agreement that the wife now sees as unfair or unrealistic, not taking into account her current emotional state. The wife's feelings have changed, and the author should have considered that their past agreement might not hold under current circumstances. The key issue is whether the agreement was a mutual understanding that could be revisited if either party felt uncomfortable later. The author's insistence on following through might be overlooking the wife's right to change her mind, even if she initially agreed.\n"
