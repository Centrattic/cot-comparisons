My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the author and his wife made an agreement five years ago where they would have children through his friends, with him not being the father but possibly an uncle. Now, when he goes to his wife with the news that his friends agreed, she's upset and wants a divorce, saying she never really agreed to this.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the history. When they first started dating, the author wanted kids when he was done with school, and his wife agreed. Then later, she confessed she didn't want to be a mom. They made a compromise where he would have kids with his friends while staying married. The key point is whether that agreement was mutual and valid.\n\nThe problem here is that the wife might not have fully agreed to the current situation. The original deal was when she might have thought it was a hypothetical. Now that it's becoming real, she's reconsidered. But the author is holding them to the five-year-old agreement. \n\nAlso, the agreement involves the author having children with other people, which is infidelity in a way, even if they're friends. The wife's reaction that she was appalled suggests that she didn't actually agree to this. Maybe the agreement was not clear or was made under emotional stress. \n\nThe author's motivation is about wanting to have children, but at the cost of his wife's emotional well-being and the integrity of their marriage. The wife might feel used or that the agreement was a temporary solution that he's now enforcing. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because the agreement was flawed from the start. Using friends to have children while remaining married is unconventional and possibly harmful. Plus, the wife's consent might not be genuine if she didn't expect actual people to agree. The author should have considered his wife's feelings and maybe discussed this more thoroughly before proceeding.\n"
