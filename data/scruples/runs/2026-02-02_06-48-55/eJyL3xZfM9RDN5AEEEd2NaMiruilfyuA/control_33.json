My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nSo, the author is a medical student who met his wife when he was starting med school. Early on, they discussed having children after he finishes his training when he has a stable job. His wife agreed. They got married, and the plan remained the same. Later, the wife reveals she never wanted kids and suggested a complicated arrangement where the author would have children with other women, using friends as surrogates or sperm donors. The author agreed to this five years ago, thinking it was a compromise. Now, when he finds two friends who agreed, his wife is upset and says she never really expected him to go through with it, leading to possible divorce again.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The original agreement was made when the wife said she didn't want kids. The author wanted kids, so they made a deal where he would have them with others. Now, after five years, the author has followed through by finding friends who agreed, but the wife is backing out. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting her to stick to the deal? Well, agreements between couples can be tricky. They made a mutual decision five years ago, but maybe the wife didn't truly mean it. The problem is that even though they had an agreement, people's feelings and positions can change over time. The wife might not have realized the implications of the agreement or perhaps didn't think the author would actually follow through. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to fulfill his desire for children, which he values deeply. However, the compromise involved the wife not being a mother, which she wanted. Now she's upset when the author moves forward with the plan. \n\nI should consider if the agreement was realistic and if both parties fully understood the terms. Also, ethical aspects: the author is using friends for this, which could have personal and emotional impacts. The wife's reaction might be based on the social and emotional consequences she hadn't considered before. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as honoring the agreement, but maybe the agreement itself was a way to avoid divorce and not a serious commitment. The wife might have thought the plan was a temporary solution, not an actual path to follow through. The author's expectation that she would accept the outcome now could be unrealistic because her initial agreement might have been under pressure to avoid divorce rather than a genuine long-term decision.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is now using his friends as sperm donors raises ethical questions. Even if the friends agreed, the long-term implications for all parties involved (the children, the author's relationships with his friends, etc.) could be problematic. The wife might not have considered these aspects when they made the agreement.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a complex situation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to keep his end of the deal, but the wife's change of heart might be valid because human emotions and circumstances evolve. The key issue is whether the original agreement was a binding one or a temporary compromise. Since the wife is now withdrawing her consent, the author might be overstepping by proceeding without her current agreement. \n\nMoreover, the author's approach to fulfilling his desire for children through this method could be problematic regardless of the agreement. Even if he isn't in the wrong legally or according to the initial deal, ethically, it's questionable. But the question is specifically about whether he's in the wrong based on the agreement. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might hinge on whether the agreement was a genuine mutual commitment. If the wife's agreement was not sincere or if she misunderstood the implications, then the author's expectation is unreasonable. Therefore, he could be in the wrong for expecting her to stick to an agreement she now regrets. Alternatively, if the agreement was clear and mutual at the time, he's not in the wrong. However, given the complexity and the passage of time, it's likely that the wife's position has evolved, making the author's insistence on the old deal unfair. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
