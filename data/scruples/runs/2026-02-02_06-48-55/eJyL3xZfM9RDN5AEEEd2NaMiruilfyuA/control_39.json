My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a married couple who made a five-year-old agreement about having children. The husband is a doctor who wanted kids later, and the wife didn't want kids. They agreed that if the wife didn't want children, he could have them with others, with certain conditions. Now, after five years, the husband found two friends willing to go through with this, but the wife is upset and breaking the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points here. The agreement was made five years ago, and both parties agreed to it at the time. The wife is now changing her mind and is upset when the husband follows through. But why would she be in the wrong? Well, maybe because once an agreement is made, both should honor it. However, there might be other aspects to consider, like the emotional and ethical implications of such an arrangement.\n\nWait, but agreements between spouses, especially about such personal matters, can be tricky. Just because they made an agreement doesn't necessarily mean it's enforceable or ethical. Also, the wife is now objecting to the terms. The husband wants to have children with others, which could be seen as a breach of trust or commitment. Even if they agreed, the wife's feelings and consent might have changed. But she had agreed to it in the first place. \n\nAnother angle is the nature of the agreement. It's a personal, private agreement, not a legal contract. So, the husband might feel entitled to follow through, but the wife's reaction suggests she didn't truly agree or maybe didn't expect the husband to find willing participants. The wife's initial reluctance to have kids and her eventual compromise might not equate to ongoing consent. \n\nAlso, the husband's desire for children and the wife's change of heart might indicate that the original agreement was based on different circumstances or expectations. The wife might now feel that the agreement was a temporary solution to avoid divorce, not a long-term commitment. \n\nBut then, the husband followed through with the agreement, and the wife is now breaking it. That could be seen as her being in the wrong. However, the ethical issues around the husband's arrangement with other women are significant. Cheating on his wife or having children with others without her full ongoing consent could be problematic. Even if they had an agreement, the emotional impact on the wife and the potential for exploitation or harm to any resulting children must be considered. \n\nMoreover, the wife's suggestion that the husband sleep with others to produce children is unconventional and could be seen as a way to avoid divorce but not necessarily a healthy or sustainable relationship dynamic. The husband's acceptance of this might have been under pressure or without fully considering the long-term implications. \n\nIn relationships, agreements can change as people's feelings and circumstances evolve. The wife might not have intended for the husband to actually proceed with the plan, thinking it was a hypothetical or a last-resort option. The husband might have taken it more seriously. This misunderstanding could be at the heart of the conflict. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If he proceeded with the agreement despite the wife's initial hesitation and without ensuring her continued consent, he might be. However, if the wife agreed to the terms and later changed her mind, she might be the one breaking the trust. But considering the unconventional nature of the agreement and the potential for harm, the husband's actions could be seen as exploitative. The wife's change of heart might be a valid reaction to realizing the consequences of the agreement she initially agreed to under duress or with different life circumstances. \n\nTherefore, the wife's objection now could be justified, and the husband's insistence on following through might be the wrong approach. The original agreement might not have been a sound or ethical solution, and the husband's actions could be seen as prioritizing his desire for children over the wife's well-being and the integrity of their marriage.\n"
