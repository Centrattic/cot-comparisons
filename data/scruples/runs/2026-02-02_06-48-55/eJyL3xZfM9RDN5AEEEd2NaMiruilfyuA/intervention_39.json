My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to stick to an agreement they made five years ago. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his wife agreed when he was in med school that they would wait until he finished his training to have children. Later, when he found out she didn't want kids, they made a new deal where he would have children with other people, but not be a father, just an uncle. Now, five years later, after he's set up with two friends, his wife is upset and backtracking, saying she didn't really agree to that.\n\nSo the author is angry because she's going against the original agreement. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let me break it down. The key points are: the initial agreement about waiting, the later agreement involving other women, and now the wife breaking that agreement. The author is hurt because he followed through, but she's changing her mind now.\n\nBut wait, is the agreement even valid? Relationships are dynamic, and people's feelings can change. The wife might have felt pressured into agreeing to the second plan, especially if it was a way to avoid divorce. Also, having children with other people could be a major ethical issue for both. The author's plan might not be acceptable to others involved, even if the friends agreed. \n\nThe wife's reaction might be based on shock and not realizing that the friends actually agreed. She might not have considered the emotional and social complexities of such an arrangement. But the author went ahead and made the plans without discussing the details again. Maybe they didn't fully agree on the terms, or maybe there was a misunderstanding.\n\nAlso, the author's stance on wanting to pass on his genes seems to be conflicting with his wife's wishes. The wife's change of heart could be because she didn't foresee the reality of the situation. However, the author also didn't check in with her again after making the plans, assuming she would accept the outcome once it was done.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider the ongoing communication and the ethical implications. Relationships require mutual agreement and understanding, and maybe the wife never truly consented to the idea of him having children with others. The agreement made five years ago might not have been a solid, well-considered decision, especially under emotional stress. \n\nOn the other hand, the author tried to honor the agreement, and the wife is now breaking it. But if the agreement was based on a misunderstanding or not fully thought out, then maybe the wife is justified in her change of heart. However, the author's actions in proceeding without re-evaluating the agreement might be the issue here. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because the situation is too complex and the agreement was made under circumstances where both might not have fully considered the long-term implications. The wife's current position is valid if she's uncomfortable with the reality of the plan. The author should have had more open communication and not made unilateral decisions based on an old agreement.\n"
