My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complex. So, the author and his wife are married. They had a deal five years ago where he wanted kids, but she didn't. They agreed that if she didn't want kids, he would have them with other women, but he wouldn't be a father, just like an uncle. Now, he's found two friends who are willing to go along with this plan, but his wife is against it now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. They made a deal because they had conflicting desires about having children. The wife didn't want to be a mother, and the husband wanted to pass on his genes. The compromise was this unusual arrangement. But now, when the husband is ready to follow through, the wife is backing out. \n\nIs the author wrong for expecting her to stick to the deal? Well, agreements between partners can be tricky. They made a mutual agreement based on their feelings at the time. However, people can change their minds, and maybe the wife's feelings have evolved. Maybe she thought the plan was a temporary solution or a way to avoid a divorce, not a long-term commitment. \n\nAlso, the ethical aspect: the husband is proposing to have children with other women, which could be seen as morally questionable, even if they agreed. The wife might feel that the situation has changed, or that she didn't fully understand the implications when she agreed. Perhaps she expected the husband to find another partner instead of using this method. \n\nAnother angle: the husband's commitment to having children is strong, but the wife's stance on not wanting to be a mother hasn't changed. However, allowing him to have children with others might strain their relationship and trust. The wife's appalled reaction suggests that this arrangement is causing her distress now, which wasn't anticipated. \n\nLegally, they might not have a binding contract, so the wife isn't obligated. Emotionally, she might feel that the deal went too far, especially if she didn't realize the seriousness of the consequences. The husband, on the other hand, believes in keeping his word, but maybe the wife didn't expect the plan to be actualized. \n\nIt's also about mutual respect. The wife might feel that the agreement was made under duress, to avoid a divorce, rather than genuine agreement. The husband might feel betrayed that she's not honoring their pact. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a matter of perspective. The author might not be in the wrong for expecting her to stick to the deal, but the wife's current stance might be valid because circumstances or feelings have changed. The key question is whether the agreement was a genuine mutual commitment or a temporary compromise. Since the wife is now appalled and wants to avoid the situation, it's possible she didn't foresee the actual implementation, making her current position reasonable. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for assuming the agreement was a firm commitment.\n"
