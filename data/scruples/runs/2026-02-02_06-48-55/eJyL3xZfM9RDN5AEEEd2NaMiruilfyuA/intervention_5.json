My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife made a five-year-old agreement about having children. The original plan was that the author would finish his medical training and have a stable job before considering kids. The wife, who works as a bank teller, agreed to this at the time. However, the wife later confessed that she never wanted children and proposed an alternative: the author could have children with other people through his friends, acting as a sperm donor. The author initially resisted but eventually agreed to this arrangement, thinking it was the best compromise to stay married.\n\nNow, five years later, the author has found two friends willing to go along with the plan. However, the wife is upset and appalled, claiming she never expected her husband to actually follow through. She's now reconsidering the agreement, leading the author to feel betrayed and considering divorce again.\n\nSo, where's the fault here? Let's look at the key points. The original agreement was made under the premise that the author's career would take priority until he was a full physician. The wife's alternative was a way to fulfill his desire for offspring without her becoming a mother. However, the wife's consent was given under specific circumstances, perhaps with the assumption that the author would not pursue this path. Maybe she didn't anticipate the emotional or social complexities of this arrangement. The author, on the other hand, took the agreement at face value and acted on it, which the wife now regrets.\n\nIn relationships, agreements can be made, but people's feelings and perspectives can change over time. The wife's reaction suggests that she may have not fully considered the implications of her proposal when they made the deal. The author, in good faith, followed through, but now the wife is backing out. However, the author's proposal to have children with other people through friends could be seen as ethically questionable, even if it was part of an agreement. It might cause emotional harm, and the wife might not have been in a position to fully agree to such a complex arrangement, especially if her initial reluctance to have children was a significant part of the conflict.\n\nInconsistencies in expectations and communication are key here. The author might have thought the agreement was binding, but the wife's change of heart indicates that the agreement wasn't as solid as he believed. Additionally, the nature of the agreement itself\u2014impregnating others while married\u2014could be considered a breach of marital trust and norms, regardless of prior agreement. So, while the author tried to find a compromise, the situation raises questions about the validity and ethicality of the original agreement. The wife's right to change her mind, especially regarding such a personal and intimate matter, might outweigh the author's expectations of a five-year-old deal. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for expecting the wife to uphold an agreement that, in hindsight, might not have been fully considered or ethically sound.\n"
