My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nSo, the author is a medical student who met his wife when he was starting med school. They talked about having kids after he finished his training when he had a stable job. The wife agreed. They got married, and the plan was still in place. Then, a few years later, the wife reveals she doesn't want kids and the author is upset because he does. They agreed to a compromise: in five years, when he's a full doctor, he'd have children with other people (his friends) and not be a father, just like an uncle. The wife thought maybe none of his friends would agree, but now two have. The wife is appalled and wants to break the agreement, leading to potential divorce.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: He wanted children, felt it was important to pass on his genes. He made a deal with his wife five years ago to have kids with others. He's following through, and the wife is now going back on the agreement. He's upset because she's not honoring their deal.\n\nThe wife's perspective: She agreed under certain circumstances. Now that the time has come, she's horrified. Maybe she didn't fully grasp the implications of the agreement when she made it. She might feel pressured or that the deal was a last resort to save the marriage. Also, maybe she didn't realize he would actually find people willing to go along with this. Her change of heart could stem from realizing the emotional and social complexities involved, or perhaps she's reconsidered the arrangement for other reasons.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: The agreement they made isn't legally binding, so the wife isn't obligated to honor it. However, ethically, if they both agreed and he followed through, the wife might be seen as breaking the trust. But trust is a two-way street here. Did the wife fully understand the implications when she agreed? If she thought it was a hypothetical or a way to avoid divorce, maybe she didn't mean for him to actually follow through. Also, having children with others could have significant emotional and psychological impacts on the author, the children, and the other women involved. The author is prioritizing his own desire for parenthood over his wife's comfort and possibly her emotional well-being. The wife might feel betrayed or that her autonomy is being disregarded.\n\nAnother angle: The original agreement was made under pressure. The wife was likely desperate to avoid divorce, so she might have agreed to something she didn't fully intend to uphold later. People can change their minds, especially about such a major life decision. The author's insistence on following through might be seen as not respecting her current feelings.\n\nAlso, the arrangement involves third parties (the author's friends), which adds layers of complexity. The friends might not have considered all the long-term implications either. The author's role as a non-parent but possibly a visitor could lead to confusion and emotional issues for the children later on. The wife might be realizing the potential harm this could cause to the family dynamics.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is sticking to a deal, but marriages often require flexibility and renegotiation of terms as circumstances change. The wife's current stance might be valid because her feelings have evolved, or maybe she didn't anticipate the reality of the situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own desires without considering his wife's current feelings and the ethical implications of the arrangement. The wife has the right to change her mind, and the agreement might not have been a mature or fully considered one. The author's actions could be seen as inflexible and not respecting his wife's autonomy after the fact.\n"
