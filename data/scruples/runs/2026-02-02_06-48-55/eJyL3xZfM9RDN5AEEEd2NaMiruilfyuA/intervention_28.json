My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple who made a deal five years ago regarding having children. The husband is a doctor, and they agreed that once he finishes his career, they would have kids. But now, the wife says she never wanted children and proposed a different plan where he could have children with his friends, which she now rejects.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband wanted children, the wife didn't, but she suggested this arrangement where he could impregnate his friends. They made an agreement five years ago. Now, when he actually gets the friends to agree, she's upset and wants to break up again. The user thinks the author (husband) is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, the question is about whether the husband is in the wrong for expecting the wife to uphold their agreement. Let me break it down. The wife initially agreed to the deal, but later changed her mind. The husband then asked friends, and they agreed. The wife now backs out, leading to potential divorce.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, agreements between partners, especially on such significant matters, can be complex. While the husband and wife made a verbal agreement, the wife's revelation that she didn't actually want children at all, even if it meant this alternative, might be a problem. The husband's plan involves creating a situation where he has children with others, which could have emotional and legal implications. Also, the wife's change of heart after the deal is made might indicate that the agreement wasn't fully mutual or considered under all circumstances.\n\nThe husband's approach to fulfilling his desire for children by using friends as sperm donors without being a father is a unique solution, but it's not without issues. The wife's current position is that she never truly expected him to follow through, so maybe she saw it as a way to make him give up. The problem is that the husband proceeded to act on the agreement, leading to the wife's rejection now. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the husband might be in the wrong because he took steps to have children outside the marriage without the wife's ongoing consent. Even if they had an agreement, the wife's current stance shows she didn't fully accept the terms. It's possible she agreed under different assumptions or pressures. The husband's actions could be seen as exploiting the agreement to achieve his own goals, which might not be fair to her. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife made the deal and then changed her mind, which could be seen as her being in the wrong. However, the husband's method of fulfilling the agreement might be ethically problematic. Having children with friends in this arrangement could lead to complications in the children's lives and the social dynamics with the friends. \n\nAlso, the husband's belief that he needs to pass on his genes as an only child might be a personal value, but that doesn't necessarily make his approach right. The wife's autonomy in her decision about motherhood is important. If she's not willing to carry a child, even through this alternative, then the agreement's terms might be invalid now. \n\nSo, considering the agreement was made five years ago and the wife's current rejection, the author (husband) might have acted in bad faith by proceeding without her continued agreement. The wife's initial agreement could have been under different circumstances, and changing her mind now is a valid right. The husband's solution, while creative, imposes his desires on others and the wife, which isn't fair. \n\nTherefore, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because the agreement wasn't respected in its true mutual consent, and the husband went ahead without ensuring the wife's ongoing commitment to the terms.\n"
