My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife made an agreement five years ago. At that time, they were planning to have children when the author finished his education and residency. But later, the wife confessed she never wanted children. The author wanted to have kids, so they made a deal: he would have children with other women (his friends), and he wouldn't be a father, just an uncle-like figure. The wife agreed then, but now, after five years, when the author has two friends willing to go through with this, she's against it and wants a divorce.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting her to stick to the agreement. From a legal standpoint, agreements between spouses about such personal matters aren't usually enforceable. But the user is asking about moral or ethical responsibility here, not legal. \n\nLooking at it morally, the wife changed her position after five years. She might feel that the deal was made under pressure or that she didn't fully consider the implications. The author, on the other hand, relied on her agreement and followed through. However, the situation is inherently problematic. The author wants a child to pass on his genes, but the mother in this scenario isn't his wife, and he's not taking a father role. This setup could have serious implications for the child's well-being and the relationships involved. \n\nAdditionally, the wife's initial agreement might not have been fully informed or considered. She might have thought the problem would resolve itself or that the author would find another way. The author's solution is unconventional and might be seen as exploiting his friends for his own genetic desires without considering the long-term effects on everyone involved. \n\nThe author's main issue is expecting the wife to honor a five-year-old agreement without considering her current feelings. People can change their minds, especially in complex emotional situations. The wife's change of heart could be due to realizing the ethical issues of the arrangement or feeling used. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some blame. The author didn't anticipate the wife's change of heart, but the wife didn't clearly communicate her new stance earlier. However, the author's plan raises ethical questions about children being born into a non-traditional family structure without a committed father figure. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing that such a personal agreement isn't binding and for not considering the ethical implications of his plan. The wife has a right to change her mind, especially if the situation is causing her distress now. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
