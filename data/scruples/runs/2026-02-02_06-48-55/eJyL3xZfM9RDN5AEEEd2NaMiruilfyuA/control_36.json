My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to stick to the deal they made five years ago. Let me go through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, they met when he was in med school. They agreed that having kids would be after he finishes training, so he could have a stable job. The wife, who's a bank teller, agreed to that. Then, a few years later, she confessed she never wanted kids. He wanted kids, so he considered divorce but then they made a compromise. The compromise was that in five years, when he's a full-time doctor, he would ask his friends to have his child via sperm donation, and he would provide child support but not be a father. The wife agreed to this. Now, five years later, he has two friends who agreed, but his wife is upset and wants to reconsider, leading to divorce again.\n\nSo the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting her to honor the original deal. Let's break it down. The key points here are the initial agreement, the circumstances under which it was made, and whether it's reasonable to expect it to hold up after five years without ongoing communication.\n\nFirst, the original agreement was made based on the wife's hope that he would change his mind about kids, but he didn't. She agreed to the compromise to avoid divorce. However, agreements made under the pressure of a potential divorce might not be as binding. Also, human feelings and circumstances can change over time. The wife now seems to be having second thoughts about the agreement, possibly realizing the emotional and social implications of the arrangement.\n\nAnother angle is the nature of the agreement itself. It's a unique and complex arrangement where the husband is having children with other women while married to his wife. This is unconventional and might not be something the wife fully anticipated or was comfortable with in the long term. The emotional impact on the wife might be significant, leading her to regret the agreement.\n\nAlso, communication is crucial in marriages. The wife's reaction now suggests that she didn't foresee the reality of the situation when she agreed five years ago. It's possible that without ongoing discussion and mutual understanding, the agreement became a temporary solution rather than a sustainable plan.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the husband expected the wife to stick to the deal, but the wife is now reconsidering because the situation is more complex than she anticipated. The husband's desire for children is valid, but the method they chose might not have been considered realistic or acceptable by the wife over time.\n\nLegal aspects aside, the ethical question is whether both parties are still in agreement. The wife's current stance suggests she no longer supports the arrangement, which could mean the original agreement is no longer valid. The husband might have a right to feel betrayed, but the wife's change of heart is also a valid emotional response.\n\nIn summary, while the husband had a specific plan to fulfill his desire for children without marriage, the wife's realization that this arrangement is problematic for her might mean she's justified in wanting to reevaluate. The author might not be in the wrong for expecting her to keep the agreement, but the wife's change in perspective could mean the situation is more nuanced. However, given that they are in a marriage and agreements can be renegotiated, the husband might be in the wrong for not considering her evolving feelings and for pushing forward with the plan despite her current objections.\n"
