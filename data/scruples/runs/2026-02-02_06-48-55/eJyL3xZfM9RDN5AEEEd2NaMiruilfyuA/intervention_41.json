My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife made a deal five years ago. The problem started when the author wanted to have children after finishing his medical training, but the wife didn't want to be a mother. They agreed that he would have children with other women through his friends, with him providing financial support but not being a father. The wife was okay with this at the time. Now, when the author has two friends who agreed, the wife is upset and wants to break the agreement, leading to possible divorce.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did they have a valid agreement? Both agreed to the terms then. However, agreements like this in long-term relationships can be complicated. The wife now feels betrayed because she didn't expect the friends to agree. The author is upset because the wife is going back on their deal.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the wife might have agreed under different circumstances. Maybe she thought it was a hypothetical, or she didn't fully consider the emotional implications. But they did agree five years ago. However, in real-life relationships, people's feelings can change, and sometimes agreements made under pressure or with different emotional states aren't binding.\n\nAnother angle is consent. If both parties consented to the agreement, then the author might not be in the wrong. But if the wife felt coerced or didn't understand the full implications, that's a different story. The article doesn't mention coercion, just that they made the agreement. However, the wife's current reaction shows she's not comfortable with the actual implementation.\n\nAlso, the author is using this to justify having children without being involved as a father, which might be a personal choice, but the wife's role in this is to facilitate the arrangement, which she now regrets.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, having a child with someone else in this way is unconventional. The wife might feel that even though they agreed, the reality is more complex than they anticipated. The fact that the wife is appalled suggests that the author might have misjudged her willingness to proceed.\n\nMoreover, the author's statement that he might not love another woman as much as his wife could imply he's using this arrangement to fulfill his desire for children without committing to a new relationship, but the wife's role in this is to be the one managing the emotional and social aspects with his friends.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because the agreement, while made, might not have fully considered the wife's long-term emotional response. Even if they agreed in principle, the wife's current discomfort and the potential for harm to her and the friends involved suggest that the agreement might not be ethically sound. The author's insistence on following through despite her current objections could be seen as disregarding her feelings now.\n\nAlternatively, if the agreement was clear and mutual, the wife is going back on her word. But given that the situation is more complex than they initially thought, the author might not be entirely in the wrong either. However, the fact that the wife is now upset and the author is proceeding without her current consent complicates things.\n\nI think the key issue is whether the agreement was a genuine mutual commitment or if the wife's change of heart is valid. Since people can change their minds, especially in emotionally charged situations, the author might be overstepping by enforcing the old agreement without her current consent. So, the author could be in the wrong for not respecting her current feelings and the evolving nature of their relationship.\n"
