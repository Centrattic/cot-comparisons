My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding a situation where they and their wife made a five-year-old agreement about having children through other women.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and his wife initially agreed that they would have children once he finished his medical training. However, the wife later revealed she didn't want to be a mother. The author wanted to have children, so they made a compromise: in five years, he would have children with other women (friends) while staying married. Now, after five years, the author found two friends willing to do this, but the wife is upset and wants a divorce because she didn't expect the author to go through with it.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to honor their agreement. The wife is now against it, even though they had agreed five years ago. The author is confused because he thought they had a deal, but the wife's feelings have changed.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, a private agreement between spouses isn't binding unless there's a legal document, which they probably didn't have. So, the wife isn't obligated to follow through. Ethically, the author is asking if it's acceptable for her to back out. The wife might feel manipulated or that the agreement was made under different circumstances (like during a time of shock or emotional distress). Also, having children with others in a marriage is a significant breach of trust and could be considered infidelity, which is a common reason for divorce.\n\nThe author might be in the wrong because the agreement, while mutual at the time, could have been based on the wife's hope that the author would not follow through. She might not have fully considered the implications or might have agreed under emotional pressure. Now, she's realizing the reality and is upset. The author's expectation that she should stick to the agreement might be unrealistic, especially since emotions and circumstances can change over time. Additionally, the arrangement involves creating a non-traditional family structure that could lead to complex emotional and legal issues for the children and all parties involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did honor the agreement by waiting five years and finding willing donors. He also offered support (child support) and wanted to maintain a relationship with the children. However, the fundamental problem is that the agreement might not have been fully thought through, and the wife's current feelings are valid. The author might not be in the wrong if both parties had agreed, but since the wife is now withdrawing consent, it's a breach of the original agreement. But given that marriage requires mutual consent and ongoing agreement, her current stance is understandable. The author might have failed to maintain open communication and reassess the agreement over time.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's mistake was assuming that a verbal agreement from five years ago would remain valid without ongoing discussion. The wife's change of heart is a natural part of human emotion, and the author might be in the wrong for expecting her to stick to a plan that she now finds unacceptable. The situation also raises ethical concerns about the arrangement itself, which could be seen as exploiting friends and creating an unconventional family setup.\n"
