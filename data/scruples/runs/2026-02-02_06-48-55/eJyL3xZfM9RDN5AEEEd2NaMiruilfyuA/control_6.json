My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong here. The situation involves a five-year-old agreement between him and his wife about having children. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the couple met when the husband was in med school. They agreed that having children would wait until he finished residency and had a stable, high-paying job. The wife, a bank teller, was on board with this plan. Then, a few years into their marriage, the wife revealed she didn't want to be a mother, which led to a proposal where they agreed that after five years, he could have children with other women while he supported them financially. The wife thought it was unlikely he'd find willing partners, but when he did, she was appalled and now wants a divorce because he's going through with the plan.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The agreement was made five years ago, and both parties agreed to it. The wife initially seemed okay with it but later changed her mind when the plan became a reality. But wait, did she actually agree to the specific terms of the husband having children with others? The husband says they worked out the details, but the wife's reaction suggests she didn't fully agree to the specifics. Maybe she thought he'd give up if the friends didn't agree, which they did. Now she's upset that he actually found people willing to participate.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, such an agreement might not hold up\u2014marital agreements about children and relationships are typically not enforceable. But the question is about moral responsibility. The husband is acting on his belief in the agreement, while the wife feels betrayed because the situation is real now. There's also the aspect of trust and emotional impact. The wife's initial reluctance to have children led to a compromise she might not have fully considered the consequences of. Additionally, the husband is using his financial stability to support the children, but the emotional and social implications for the children and the wife are significant.\n\nThe wife's reaction indicates that she didn't foresee the actual execution of the plan. Maybe she thought it was a theoretical solution but didn't realize she'd be uncomfortable with it once it materialized. The husband, on the other hand, followed through as agreed. However, the agreement was based on mutual consent, but the wife's change of heart raises issues about the sustainability of such agreements and the importance of ongoing communication. \n\nIn terms of fault, the husband isn't necessarily violating any laws or clear ethical standards beyond his and his wife's personal morals. But the wife's emotional response is valid because she's now facing a reality she wasn't prepared for. The problem may stem from unmet expectations and a misunderstanding of the agreement's depth. The husband might be in the right for following through on an agreement, but the wife's feelings of betrayal are legitimate. However, the initial agreement was made under specific circumstances, and both parties should have considered the long-term implications.\n\nConsidering all this, the husband isn't in the wrong based on the agreement they made, even though the outcome is problematic for the wife. The core issue is whether the original agreement was truly mutual and understood in all its aspects. If both parties agreed to the specifics, then the husband isn't at fault. But if the wife's agreement was conditional on the husband not actually pursuing it, then there's a problem. However, the narrative suggests that they did agree to the details, so the husband is acting within the bounds of their agreement. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
