My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nSo, the author and his wife had an agreement five years ago. When they were planning their future, they agreed that they would have kids once the author finished his medical training. The wife didn't want to be a mother, so they came up with this alternative plan where the author would have children with other people through his friends, with the wife's consent. Now, five years later, the author has two friends who agreed to this, but the wife is upset and wants to back out of the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of their agreement. They made a deal when they were both in a different place in their lives. The wife might have thought that the author would change his mind about having kids, but he didn't. Now that he's in a position to do this, she's uncomfortable with the reality. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting her to stick to the original agreement.\n\nThe wife's argument is that she never expected her husband to actually go through with this. Maybe she thought that the author would find a way to compromise or that the friends would refuse. The author, on the other hand, believes he's fulfilling the agreement they made. But agreements can sometimes be influenced by changing circumstances or misunderstandings. \n\nI should also think about the ethical implications. The wife is being asked to accept a situation where her husband is having children with other women. Even if there was an agreement, the emotional impact on the wife might be significant. Trust and emotional well-being in a marriage are important. If the wife is now appalled, it might indicate that the agreement wasn't fully thought through or that there was a misunderstanding about the terms.\n\nAnother angle is that the wife might not have anticipated the author's determination to have children through this method. Maybe she felt pressured into the agreement initially because she didn't want to face a divorce. It's possible that the agreement was made under emotional stress and not a fully considered mutual decision. \n\nAlso, the author is suggesting that he's not going to be the father but just a visitor, which might not align with the wife's expectations. Perhaps she thought the author would find another way to have children without involving third parties, but the plan was to use his friends. \n\nLegally, such an agreement might not hold up, but the question is more about moral wrongness. Ethically, the wife might feel that the agreement was too extreme, and the author is holding her to it even though her feelings have changed. In relationships, mutual respect and understanding are key. If one party's needs have changed or were misunderstood, the agreement might need renegotiation.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering his wife's changed feelings and the emotional impact. The agreement, while made in good faith, might not account for the complexities and emotional aspects of such a decision. The wife's distress indicates that the agreement might not be sustainable, and the author's insistence on following through could be seen as disregarding her current well-being.\n"
