My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me look at the key points.\n\nThe author and his wife made a deal five years ago where he would have children with other people after becoming a physician, while she wouldn't be a mother. Now, he's found two friends willing to go along with this, but she's upset and wants a divorce. \n\nFirst, the initial agreement was made under certain circumstances. When they were together, she agreed to the plan because he was in med school and wanted to have children later. But now, she's changed her mind. The question is whether he's at fault for expecting her to stick to the old deal.\n\nThe wife's current reaction is that she never really wanted him to go through with the plan. She might have thought it was a way to avoid divorce but didn't expect him to follow through. The author, on the other hand, sees it as a valid agreement they made when they were both in agreement. \n\nLegally, agreements like this aren't enforceable, but the emotional aspect is the issue here. The wife might feel betrayed because the situation is different now. She might not have considered the emotional impact on herself or the other women involved. The author is prioritizing his desire to have children, which is important to him, but it's causing significant conflict. \n\nEthically, there's a question of consent and the long-term validity of agreements made under different circumstances. The wife might have agreed to the plan under the assumption that it was a temporary measure during their marriage, not that she would have to accept him having relationships with others. The author's solution might also have emotional consequences for the children and the other mothers involved. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as not considering his wife's changing feelings and respecting the original agreement's context. Even though they made the deal when they were both in agreement, people's perspectives can change over time. The wife's current distress suggests that the agreement might not have been a stable or sustainable solution. \n\nIn terms of who is at fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong for following through on an agreement, but the wife's right to change her mind and the emotional impact of the situation could tip the scales. The problem is that the agreement was based on mutual trust and future expectations, which have now been disrupted. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's expectation that the wife would stick to the original plan despite her current feelings might be unreasonable. The wife's reaction highlights the complexity of such agreements and the importance of ongoing communication. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing her changed circumstances and the emotional toll it's taking on her.\n"
