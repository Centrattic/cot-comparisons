My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The key points are that the author and his wife made an agreement five years ago where the author would have children with other people once he became a doctor, so his wife wouldn't have to be a mother. Now, he's found two friends willing to do this, but his wife is upset and wants to divorce because she didn't expect the plan to actually work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement they made. They both agreed to this plan, right? The author wanted kids, his wife didn't, so she suggested this alternative. So from a legal standpoint, they had a mutual agreement. But maybe there's an emotional aspect here that's missing. The wife is now appalled, saying she never thought the author's friends would agree. But she did agree to the plan, even if she thought it was unlikely. \n\nHowever, making such an arrangement isn't just about mutual consent. There are ethical and emotional implications. The wife might feel that this agreement is unrealistic or that the author is putting her in a position where she has to be okay with his relationships with other women. Also, the fact that the friends are married or single might complicate things. The author's plan to not be a father but just an uncle could be another point of contention. \n\nAnother angle is the expectation versus reality. The wife might have thought the plan was a way to avoid the issue, but now that it's feasible, she's uncomfortable. Maybe she didn't fully consider the emotional impact on herself when they made the agreement. On the other hand, the author followed through on his part of the deal, which he believed they both agreed upon. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the wife changing her stance after agreeing to the plan. If they had a mutual agreement, and the author fulfilled his part, then the wife breaking the agreement could be seen as her being in the wrong. However, if the agreement was based on a misunderstanding or if the wife never truly intended for it to happen, that's different. \n\nI should also think about societal norms and relationships. Having children with others outside of the marriage is unconventional and could be seen as infidelity. Even though it's a planned arrangement, it might not align with traditional marital expectations, which could strain the relationship regardless of the initial agreement. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author followed through on his part of the agreement, the emotional and ethical complexities might mean he's not entirely in the right. The wife's reaction could stem from unanticipated consequences, but she did agree to the plan. It's tricky because consent was given, but the reality might have been more burdensome than anticipated. The author might be in the wrong for pushing through with the plan without considering his wife's feelings upon execution, even if they agreed initially.\n"
