My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex. Let me break it down.\n\nSo, the author and his wife made an agreement five years ago. At the time, they were both in a relationship where the author was in med school, and they agreed that having children would happen when he was established in his career with a 9-5 job. The wife was a bank teller with good hours, so they agreed to stick with that plan. Then, a few years later, the wife confessed she didn't want to be a mother. The author wanted children, so they considered divorce but then came up with an alternative agreement: the author would use other women to have his children, with the wife's consent. The terms were that the author wouldn't be the father but could visit as an uncle, and the wife would handle child support.\n\nNow, five years later, the author has found two friends willing to be the mothers (one with a sterile husband, another single woman). He presents this to the wife, but she's upset, appalled, and wants the agreement to not go through. The author is now considering divorce again because the wife is breaking the original agreement.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points.\n\nFirst, the original agreement was based on the wife's hope that the author would change his mind about children. She didn't want to be a mother, so they made a compromise. But maybe the wife's agreement was under different circumstances. At the time, she might have thought that the author wouldn't find willing partners, or that she could avoid motherhood. Now that he's found people, she's reconsidering.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, agreements between partners can be complex. They might be based on mutual understanding and trust. However, this agreement is unusual. Using friends for surrogacy or sperm donation without the wife being involved could be problematic. Also, the wife's change of heart might be due to realizing the implications of the agreement. Maybe she didn't foresee the emotional impact on herself or the children. \n\nThe author's perspective is that he honored the agreement by finding two friends. The wife, however, is now against it. The author's actions might be considered respecting the agreement, but the wife's change of heart could be due to realizing the agreement's flaws. \n\nAnother angle: the agreement might not have been fully thought out. Five years is a long time, and people's feelings can evolve. The wife might now feel that the agreement was made under the assumption that the author would never find willing partners, but now she's facing a reality she's not comfortable with. \n\nAlso, the author's approach of having children with other women while married to his wife, even with her consent, raises questions about the nature of the relationship. Traditional marriage norms suggest that both partners agree on such significant decisions. The wife might feel that the agreement was a temporary solution, not a binding contract. \n\nLegally, such agreements aren't enforceable for personal relationships. Ethically, the wife's current stance might be valid because personal circumstances and emotions can change. The author might be expecting her to stick to a past decision without considering her evolving feelings. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author was committed to having children, and the wife initially agreed to the compromise. But now, she's reevaluating, which is her right. The key issue is whether the original agreement was realistic and ethically sound. Using friends in this way could strain those relationships and have long-term consequences. \n\nThe author might argue that he followed through on his part, but the wife's refusal to accept the outcome now could be seen as her rethinking a decision made under different emotions or expectations. It's possible that the wife didn't anticipate the author finding partners, leading her to feel cornered. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong for expecting the agreement to hold, but the wife's current stance might be a valid change of heart. However, the situation is morally ambiguous. The author's actions could be seen as respecting the agreement, but the wife's right to change her mind is also important. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the agreement was a binding contract or a mutual understanding that could be revisited. Since it's a personal relationship, agreements can be fluid. The wife might have the right to reconsider, making the author not necessarily in the wrong, but the situation is complex. However, the author's expectation that the wife would stick to the agreement might not account for her changed perspective, which is a human aspect. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he followed through on the agreement made at the time. However, there's a strong argument that the wife's change of heart is valid, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Given the parameters of the question, the answer might be B.\n"
