My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is complex. The author and his wife had a five-year agreement where they would have a child not with each other but through the author having a child with his friends, with the wife's agreement. Now, after five years, when the author presents the friends who agreed, the wife is upset and wants a divorce.\n\nFirst, the key points are the original agreement. They agreed that when the author becomes a full-time physician, he would seek a child with friends, not with her. The wife's reasoning was that she didn't want to be a mother. The author wanted to pass on his genes. They made a deal to avoid divorce. Now, the wife is breaking the agreement, which the author is upset about.\n\nBut wait, is this agreement valid? Legally, maybe not, but the question is about moral blame. The wife might have thought she was being reasonable, but she made a deal. The author followed through when he had the means. However, the wife's reaction is that she never really agreed to this. She might have thought it was a hypothetical or a way to avoid divorce, not an actual plan she wanted to follow through. \n\nThe problem here is communication. The wife might not have fully understood the implications of the agreement. She might have made it to keep the marriage, not expecting the author to actually go through with it. The author, on the other hand, took the agreement seriously and made actual plans. \n\nEthically, is it fair for the wife to change her mind? If they had a mutual agreement, then breaking it could be seen as the wife being in the wrong. But if the agreement was based on a misunderstanding or if the wife was coerced (to avoid divorce), then maybe she's not at fault. \n\nAlso, the concept of having children with others is unconventional. The wife might have agreed under the idea that it was a temporary solution, not a permanent plan. The author might have taken it as a binding agreement. \n\nAnother angle: the wife's initial refusal to have children was a major issue. The author wanted children; she didn't. They couldn't resolve it, so they made a compromise. But the compromise itself is ethically questionable. The author is planning to have children with others while married, which could be seen as a breach of trust or marriage vows. However, they had the agreement, so maybe it's different. \n\nIn many cultures, having a child with someone else while married is considered adultery or infidelity. Even if it's a mutual agreement, it's legally and ethically murky. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife agreed, then the author is following through. However, if the agreement was not clear or if the wife is now realizing the full implications, she might feel trapped. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wanted his genes passed on, and he made a deal to achieve that. The wife feels betrayed because she didn't expect actual agreements to be made. The question is whether the author's actions are reasonable given the agreement. If the agreement was explicit and both parties understood and agreed, then the author is not in the wrong. However, if the agreement was based on a misunderstanding or if the wife was trying to avoid divorce at the time without fully committing to the plan, then the author might be in the wrong for proceeding. \n\nAlso, considering that the wife is now upset because she thought no one would agree, but the author actually found people who did. The wife's original solution might have been a way to avoid divorce, but she didn't anticipate the author being able to follow through. The author might be in the wrong for taking the agreement too literally, not considering the emotional impact on the wife. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because the agreement, while made in good faith, might not have been fully understood by both parties. The wife's change of heart could be due to realizing the reality of the situation, which the author didn't account for. The author's actions could be seen as proceeding with a plan that the wife didn't truly accept, leading to her current distress.\n"
