My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a couple who made a five-year-old agreement about having children. The husband, a med student at the time, wanted to wait until he had a stable career, and the wife agreed. However, the wife later didn't want children. They decided to stay married but made a plan where the husband would have children with his friends, and the wife would raise them as if they were her own. Now, five years later, when the husband is ready and his friends have agreed, the wife is against it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. Both parties agreed on a plan, so the husband expected her to stick to it. But the wife is now changing her mind. The key issue here is whether the agreement was valid and binding, and if the wife is justified in her change of heart.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, personal agreements between spouses aren't enforceable unless there's a legal contract. So the husband can't force her to follow through. However, ethically, it's more complex. The wife might have felt pressured to agree initially, or she might not have fully considered the implications. On the other hand, the husband believed in the agreement and made plans based on it.\n\nAnother angle is the nature of the agreement. The wife wanted to stay married, so she might have seen this as a compromise. But now, she's upset because the plan is moving forward. The husband's actions could be seen as following through on a promise, but the wife's emotional response is valid too. She might have felt it was a way to keep the marriage without actually committing to the child-rearing aspect.\n\nAlso, the husband's motivation for wanting children (passing on his genes) is personal, but the wife's refusal to have children is also her right. The agreement they made was a way to reconcile these conflicting desires. However, the wife's current stance suggests she might not have fully committed to the agreement from the start, or she's realized she can't support it.\n\nIn terms of fault, the husband isn't wrong in expecting the agreement to hold, but the wife's change of heart is also understandable given the emotional and practical challenges. Both parties might have misjudged their own long-term feelings. The husband's proposal to have children with others is unconventional and might not have been something the wife truly accepted, even if she agreed at the time.\n\nThe answer would depend on whether the agreement was a serious, mutual commitment or a temporary solution. If they made a formal agreement, the husband is justified. But if the wife's agreement was more of a reluctant acceptance, then her change of heart is valid. However, given the scenario, the author (husband) might be in the right in expecting the agreement to be honored, but the wife's emotional response is also valid. But since the wife is now going against the agreement, the husband isn't in the wrong for following through.\n"
