My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation he described. Let's break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife were in a relationship when he was in med school. They agreed that having children would come after he finished school and residency when he had a stable job. The wife agreed to this plan. They got married, and the plan stayed the same. Then, years later, the wife admitted she didn't want to be a mother. The author then considered divorce but decided against it because he loved her and wasn't sure he could love someone else. So they made an agreement: in five years, when the author was a full physician, he would have children with his friends using donor arrangements. The wife would receive child support from him, and he wouldn't be the father, just an uncle if allowed. Now, five years later, the author has two friends who agreed, but the wife is upset and wants a divorce, saying she never expected him to follow through.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the initial agreement and the wife's current reaction. The author is upset because he thought they had a deal. But wait, was the agreement realistic? The wife might not have truly agreed to that arrangement. The problem is, when they made the agreement, the wife might have thought it was a hypothetical or a temporary solution, not that he would actually proceed. Also, the agreement involves her husband impregnating other women, which is a significant ethical and emotional issue. Even if they agreed to it, maybe the wife didn't fully consent or understand the implications. Also, in many cultures, this kind of arrangement is not socially acceptable, and it's possible that the wife felt pressured or didn't realize how serious he was.\n\nAnother aspect is the author's expectation. He expected his wife to stick to the five-year-old agreement, but she might have felt it was a last-ditch effort to avoid divorce and not a binding contract. The fact that she was \"appalled\" when he told her the friends agreed suggests she didn't take it seriously. So maybe the author made an unrealistic agreement without considering her deeper feelings or the practicality. The wife's refusal now could be because she never truly agreed to the specifics, especially the part about him fathering children with others. Even if they had an agreement, such arrangements can be legally and emotionally complex, and it's possible she didn't realize the extent of what she was agreeing to.\n\nAlso, the author is prioritizing his desire to have children over his wife's current objections. Even if they had an agreement, people's feelings can change, and the wife is now clearly against the idea. The author might be holding her to an old arrangement that she's no longer comfortable with, which could be unfair. The fact that she is now seeking a divorce indicates that the situation is untenable for her.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for expecting the wife to go along with an agreement that she now finds unacceptable, especially if the agreement was made under emotional pressure or without full understanding. The wife has the right to change her mind, and the author's insistence on following through despite her current objections could be seen as disregarding her autonomy and emotional well-being. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
