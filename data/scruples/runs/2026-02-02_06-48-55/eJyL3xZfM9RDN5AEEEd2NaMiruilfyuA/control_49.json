My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his wife made a deal five years ago where he would have children with other people once he became a doctor, and she would be okay with that. Now, he has two friends who agreed, but his wife is upset and wants a divorce because she didn't expect the friends to agree. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the original agreement. They both agreed that when he became a doctor, he could have children with others. She didn't object at the time. But now, she's changing her stance. Maybe she thought it was just a hypothetical or not something he would actually follow through on? The problem here is whether the agreement was clear and mutual, and if she's now breaking it by objecting later.\n\nThe author wants children, which is his personal desire. He's using his resources (friends who are willing) to fulfill that. His wife, on the other hand, is the one who initially agreed but now is backing out. That's conflicting. But does the wife have a right to change her mind? Or was the agreement binding?\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of emotional impact. The wife is appalled, which suggests she didn't actually expect the situation to come to fruition. Maybe she agreed in theory but not in practice. The author might have thought she was okay with it, but maybe she wasn't fully on board. \n\nEthically, creating children without being in a relationship with the mothers could have implications. The author is not the legal father, but he's offering child support and visits. However, the wife's agreement was based on him having children without her, which is a significant arrangement. If she's now against it, it's a breach of their prior agreement. \n\nBut maybe the wife didn't realize the practical aspects. She might have thought it was a long shot or not something he would pursue. Now that it's a reality, she's upset. The author argues that he followed through on their agreement, so he's not in the wrong. The wife, however, is now changing her position, which might be her mistake. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the original agreement was flawed. The wife might have agreed under different circumstances or misunderstandings. For example, she might not have considered the emotional impact on her or the complexity of the situation. If she's now unhappy, it's her responsibility to address that. The author could be in the right by sticking to the deal, but maybe he should have checked in with her periodically to ensure mutual consent. \n\nHowever, the key point is whether the agreement was valid and if the wife is now violating it. Since they both agreed and he followed through, the author isn't necessarily at fault. The wife's change of heart could be her issue, not his. But there's also the question of whether such an agreement is ethical or enforceable in the first place. \n\nGiven all that, the author might not be in the wrong because he honored their agreement. The wife's problem is with his friends agreeing, which is beyond his control. So, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
