My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is complicated. So, the author and his wife made a deal five years ago where he would have children with other people through friends, and the wife wouldn't be the mother. Now, when he finds out that his friends are willing to go along with it, the wife is upset and wants a divorce. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the agreement they made. They had a plan where he would father children with others, and she would not be involved. But when he actually goes to implement this plan, she backs out. Is the problem that he followed through on the agreement they made, or is there something else? \n\nThe wife's perspective is important. She might feel that the agreement was made under different circumstances or that she didn't fully understand the implications at the time. Maybe she was hoping he would change his mind or that the plan was just a last resort. Also, the emotional aspect: she's the one who initially didn't want children, but now she's upset about the method he's using. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and whether the agreement was a genuine mutual understanding. If the wife made the agreement under pressure or because she thought it was the only way to keep the marriage, that could be a factor. Also, the fact that he's using friends, who might have their own feelings about this, adds another layer. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he wanted to fulfill his desire to have children, and the wife agreed to this setup. However, when it comes time to execute the plan, she's against it. So, who is breaking the agreement? If the agreement was clear and mutual, then the wife is going back on her word. But if the agreement was never clear or if she felt coerced, then maybe the problem lies with the agreement itself. \n\nAnother angle: the author is using his friends as sperm donors, which could have significant implications for them and any resulting children. This might not be ethically sound, even if both parties agreed. Also, the author's insistence on having biological children might be conflicting with the wife's original stance on not wanting to be a mother, but now she's upset about the method. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for following through on an agreement. If the agreement was valid and both parties understood the terms, then the wife is in the wrong for not honoring it. But if the agreement was based on misunderstandings or if the wife's consent was not fully informed, then the author might be at fault for not recognizing that. \n\nAdditionally, the emotional impact on all parties involved\u2014friends, the wife, and any future children\u2014should be considered. The author's approach might be causing harm that he didn't anticipate. \n\nIn conclusion, it seems like the author made a plan that he believed was agreed upon, but the wife's change of heart suggests that the agreement might not have been as solid as he thought. The key issue is the validity and mutual understanding of the original agreement. If the wife genuinely agreed and then reneged without valid reasons, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the agreement was flawed from the start, the author might share some responsibility for not ensuring mutual consent and considering the ethical implications.\n"
