My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the author (the person writing the scenario) is in the wrong. The story is about a married couple who made a deal five years ago regarding having children. The husband is a doctor who wanted kids in the future, but his wife didn't want to be a mother. They agreed that he could father children with other women once he was a full-time doctor, as long as he wasn't the father and just an uncle. Now, after five years, the husband finds two friends willing to participate, but the wife backs out of the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The initial agreement was made under specific circumstances. The wife, a bank teller, wanted to avoid motherhood. The husband wanted to pass on his genes but didn't want to have children with her. The agreement was that he would find other women (friends) to have his children, with the understanding that he wouldn't be the father, just an uncle, and he'd provide child support. \n\nNow, the wife is rejecting the agreement because she didn't expect the friends to agree. She's upset and considering divorce again. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for expecting her to stick to the deal.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the husband is justified in expecting his wife to honor the agreement. There are several angles to consider here. Legally, agreements like this aren't enforceable in most cases, but that's not the main point here. The question is about moral or ethical responsibility.\n\nFrom the husband's perspective, he believed he had an agreement. He went through with the plan, found two friends, and now the wife is reneging. He's upset because he thought they had a mutual understanding. However, the wife's change of heart might stem from emotional or psychological reasons. Maybe she didn't foresee the emotional impact of him fathering children with others. Also, such an arrangement is unconventional and could lead to complex family dynamics, which she might not have considered when she agreed initially.\n\nAnother angle is consent. Did both parties fully understand the implications of the agreement at the time? The wife might have agreed under different circumstances or with different expectations. Human emotions and desires can change over time, so her current feelings might be valid even if they contradict the original deal.\n\nAdditionally, societal norms and personal ethics play a role here. The husband's desire to have children through this arrangement could be seen as problematic, especially if it causes distress to his wife. Even if they had an agreement, the wife's well-being and emotional state matter. She might feel trapped, used, or that the agreement was made under pressure or without fully considering the consequences.\n\nThe husband's actions could also be viewed as self-serving. He's using his position of power (being a doctor with financial stability) to push forward with a plan that benefits his desire for children, potentially at the expense of his wife's comfort and emotional health. This could indicate a lack of empathy or understanding on his part.\n\nThere's also the aspect of trust and commitment in the marriage. Marriages require ongoing communication and mutual respect. The wife might feel that the original agreement was made in a specific context and that circumstances have changed. The husband's insistence on following through could be seen as disregarding her current feelings and the evolving nature of their relationship.\n\nIn summary, while the husband might feel he's acting on a prior agreement, the wife's emotional response and current stance are valid. The situation highlights the importance of ongoing dialogue in relationships and the fact that agreements made under certain conditions might not hold when circumstances change. The husband's expectation that the wife adhere to a five-year-old agreement without considering her current feelings could be seen as the wrong, making him in the wrong (Answer A). However, there's also an argument for the wife changing her mind, but the key here is whether the husband is in the wrong for expecting her to follow through without addressing her current concerns.\n"
