My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to stick to an agreement they made five years ago.\n\nFirst, the background: The author and his wife made a deal when he was in med school. He wanted kids when he was a full-time doctor, and she agreed. However, she later revealed she didn't want children. They ended up making a compromise where he would have children with friends while she would be a mother figure in some way. Now, five years later, when he's ready, he tells her the friends have agreed, but she's upset and wants a divorce.\n\nSo, key points here. The initial agreement was based on the wife's desire for the author to have children, but she didn't want to be a mother herself. They came up with an alternative. However, the author now wants to proceed with this plan, but the wife is against it now, even though they had agreed to it before.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider possible angles. The wife might feel that the agreement was made under pressure or in a different emotional state. Also, the plan involves the author having children with others, which could be seen as a betrayal or a significant change in their relationship. The fact that she's appalled now might indicate that she didn't fully consider the implications of the agreement five years ago, or maybe she felt she had no other choice at the time.\n\nOn the other hand, the author believed in the agreement and followed through as planned. He might argue that he honored their deal. But the wife's reaction suggests that the agreement was not as clear or consensual as he thought. Maybe the initial agreement was based on a temporary solution, and she expected him to find another way rather than proceeding with this plan. Also, the idea of the author having children with other women could be a breach of trust or emotional harm that she hadn't anticipated.\n\nAnother aspect is the wife's initial hesitation about the author having children. She didn't want to be a mother but allowed him to have children with others. However, when the time came, she might feel that the reality of the situation is different from her expectations. The author's assumption that she would accept the plan's execution now might be a misunderstanding of her true feelings or a change in her stance over time.\n\nAdditionally, the legal and emotional implications of such an arrangement are complex. Even if they had an agreement, the wife's consent might not be as binding as the author believes. Relationships can evolve, and people's feelings can change. The wife might now feel that the agreement was made under different circumstances and that she didn't fully consent to the specifics.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author expected the wife to stick to an agreement made in a past context, but relationships require ongoing communication and mutual consent. If the wife now feels uncomfortable with the plan, it's possible that the initial agreement wasn't as solid as the author thought. The author might be in the wrong for not considering her current feelings and for proceeding without her current consent.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because he expected the wife to uphold an agreement that she may not have truly agreed to in the first place, or her stance has changed. The relationship's foundation is built on mutual trust and respect, and the author's actions could be seen as disregarding her current feelings, leading to the possibility of the marriage breaking down.\n"
