My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. So, the situation involves a couple who made an agreement five years ago. The husband is a doctor who wanted to have children, but his wife didn't want to be a mother. They decided that when he became a full-time physician, he could have children with other women, and she would not be the mother. Now, after five years, he's found two friends willing to go along with this plan, but his wife is upset and wants a divorce because she didn't expect the plan to actually work out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple had a mutual agreement back when they were together. The husband wanted children, the wife didn't. They came up with a compromise where he could have kids with others, and she would not be involved. Now, the husband has followed through on that agreement by finding people willing to participate, but the wife is against it now. \n\nOne thing to note is that the wife's current reaction might be based on a change of heart or a realization that the original agreement was not realistic or acceptable to her. She might have been more open to the idea in the past but now sees it as unacceptable. The husband, on the other hand, is sticking to the agreement they made, believing he's fulfilling his part.\n\nBut wait, agreements between people can be subject to change, especially if circumstances or feelings evolve. The wife might have thought that the plan was a hypothetical or a temporary solution, and not something she actually expected to happen. The husband's expectation might have been valid based on their prior agreement, but the wife's current reaction suggests that she didn't really agree to the terms she's now backing out of.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. The wife's initial agreement might have been made under different circumstances or with a different understanding. Maybe she felt pressured to agree at the time, or she didn't foresee the actual logistics. Now, seeing the plan in motion, she's uncomfortable and wants to end the marriage. The husband is hurt because he believed they had a solid agreement, and he's now facing a potential divorce again.\n\nAlso, from a legal standpoint, such an agreement might not be binding, especially regarding matters like child support or custody, but the question here is more about moral responsibility rather than legal. The user is asking if the author is morally in the wrong, not whether it's legally enforceable.\n\nThe husband's actions are following the agreement, so he might not see himself as wrong. However, the wife's change of heart could indicate that the original agreement wasn't a clear mutual consent or that there was a misunderstanding. The husband might have assumed the agreement was valid, but if the wife now feels it's invalid, that could mean he's acting on a flawed premise.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The husband might have believed he was honoring the agreement, but the wife's current distress shows that the agreement might not have been as clear as he thought. There could be a lack of ongoing communication since the agreement was made five years ago, and circumstances have changed for both parties.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because he's proceeding with an agreement that the wife now rejects, indicating that maybe the original agreement wasn't as consensual or mutual as he believed. The wife's current reaction suggests she didn't truly agree to the terms in the way he interpreted them, which could mean he acted on an invalid understanding. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
