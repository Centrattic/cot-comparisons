My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The situation involves a couple who made an agreement five years ago about having children through friends. Now the wife is upset because the author has found friends willing to participate, and she's breaking the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to unpack the details. The author and his wife met during med school. The author's career path meant they agreed to have kids later when he was established. The wife didn't want kids, so they made an arrangement where the author would have children with other people through friends, acting as a sperm donor. Now, after five years, the author found two friends who agreed, but the wife is not okay with it anymore and wants to cancel the deal.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is wrong for expecting the wife to stick to their five-year-old agreement. Let's consider the ethical aspects here. The agreement was made under specific circumstances, but people's feelings and priorities can change over time. The wife's initial consent was based on her desire not to be a mother and the author's desire to have children. However, now she's appalled, which suggests she might not have fully considered the implications at the time or her feelings have evolved.\n\nThe author's perspective is that they had a deal, so he's not in the wrong for following through. But the wife's change of heart introduces a conflict. Agreements require mutual consent, but if one party's circumstances or feelings change significantly, the other might need to reassess. The wife might feel pressured or that the agreement was made out of desperation or at a time when she didn't fully understand the consequences. \n\nAlso, the nature of the agreement is unconventional. Using friends as surrogate parents and the author not being a father could have emotional and social complexities. The wife might now feel that the agreement was unrealistic or that the author's expectations were too high. Additionally, the wife's initial hope that the author would change his mind about children might not have been communicated clearly, leading to a misunderstanding.\n\nAnother angle: the author agreed to not be a father, just an uncle, but the children would technically be his biologically. The wife might have underestimated the emotional bond the author would have with the children, even if it's not legal. The author's commitment to passing on his genes and family line is a strong motivator, but the wife's role in facilitating this arrangement could lead to long-term emotional issues.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author might feel wronged because the wife is breaking a promise. However, the wife might feel that the agreement was made under different circumstances and that her current stance is valid. The key here is whether the agreement was fair and if both parties fully understood the implications. The wife might not have considered the possibility that the author's friends would actually agree, or she might now feel uncomfortable with the arrangement's complexity.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. The author isn't wrong for following through on an agreement, but the wife's change of heart is understandable. The problem is that agreements, especially those involving such personal and emotional matters, can't be set in stone. The author might need to acknowledge that people can change and that the wife's current feelings are legitimate. However, the author's dedication to having children and his career path were part of the initial agreement. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expecting the agreement to hold, the situation highlights the difficulty of making long-term decisions about such personal matters. The wife's change in perspective is a key factor here. Since the agreement was between two people with different values and evolving feelings, the fault isn't entirely on one side. But since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and given that the wife is breaking the agreement now, there might be an argument that the author isn't in the wrong for following through, but the wife's current stance is also a valid response to her changed circumstances. However, the answer might lean towards the author being in the right because he honored the agreement, while the wife's refusal now is the issue. But I need to make sure.\n"
