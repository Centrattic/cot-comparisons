My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who made an agreement five years ago regarding having children. The author (man) wanted to have kids but his wife didn't. To compromise, they agreed that he could have children with others once he became a doctor, without being the father. Now, after five years, he has two friends who agreed, but his wife is upset and wants to cancel the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. Legally, an agreement between two people about such a sensitive matter might not hold up, but the question is about moral wrongdoing. \n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement and the wife's reaction. The man was committed to having kids, so they made this unique arrangement where he'd father children with others. The wife agreed to this at the time. Now, when he follows through, she's against it. \n\nBut wait, maybe she didn't really mean to agree to such a drastic step. People might agree to things under pressure or in a specific emotional state. The wife might have thought it was a hypothetical or a way to avoid divorce, not an actual plan she was comfortable with. \n\nAlso, the man's desire to pass on his genes is personal, but the arrangement involves others and has significant emotional and ethical implications. The wife might feel that agreeing to this was a mistake, especially if she didn't fully realize the consequences. \n\nAnother angle: the man is using his friends as sperm donors, which could have serious implications for those involved. The friends might not consider all aspects, like the child's right to know their genetic origins or the emotional impact on the families. The wife's surprise suggests she didn't expect the plan to be taken so literally. \n\nThe man's actions could be seen as violating the spirit of the agreement. Even if they made the agreement, the wife's changing stance shows that she might not have fully considered the reality of the situation. Similarly, the man might have assumed she was okay with it, but her reaction indicates otherwise. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, both parties might share some blame. The wife agreed initially, but her later objection is valid. The man proceeded without checking in with her again, assuming she still agreed. The situation highlights the importance of ongoing communication and the limits of such agreements over time. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't account for his wife's evolving feelings and the practical implications of their agreement. Even though they had a deal, the emotional and ethical complexities might mean he overstepped by moving forward without her current consent.\n"
