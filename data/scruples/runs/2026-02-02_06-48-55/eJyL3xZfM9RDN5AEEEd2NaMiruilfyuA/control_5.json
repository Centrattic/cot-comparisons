  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for expecting my wife to still agree with the deal we made 5 years ago?\n\nThis situation is complicated. My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is complex.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife agreed five years ago that he would become a doctor and then, if possible, have children with other women while the wife would not be the mother. The author now has two friends who agreed to this arrangement, but his wife is upset and wants to cancel the agreement.\n\nSo, the key here is whether the original agreement was valid and if breaking it is justified. The author believes he's in the right because they had a deal. The wife is now against the idea, feeling betrayed or surprised by the friends' acceptance. \n\nI need to consider consent and the nature of the agreement. When they made the deal, did the wife fully understand the implications? The author mentions she was shocked when he proposed the arrangement. Maybe she didn't expect the friends to agree, so the agreement might have been based on an assumption that wasn't realistic. \n\nAlso, ethical considerations come into play. The author is planning to have children with others while married, which is a form of infidelity and could be considered unethical or even illegal in some places. Even if there's an agreement, some jurisdictions might not recognize such arrangements as valid. \n\nAnother angle is emotional impact. The wife's feelings of betrayal and the potential harm to the children's well-being. Even if the author intended to be involved as an uncle, that's a complex dynamic that could lead to issues down the line.\n\nThe author's argument is that he wanted to pass on his genes and that the wife agreed. However, the wife's current reaction suggests that the agreement wasn't as solid as he thought. Maybe the wife's initial agreement was under different expectations or pressures.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral standards, having children with others while married without the spouse's ongoing consent is problematic. Even if there was prior agreement, the wife's current refusal invalidates any such arrangement. The author might be in the wrong because he's proceeding without her current consent, which is essential in any marital agreement.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong because the original agreement wasn't respected once the wife changed her mind, and the situation involves infidelity and potential legal/ethical violations.\n"
