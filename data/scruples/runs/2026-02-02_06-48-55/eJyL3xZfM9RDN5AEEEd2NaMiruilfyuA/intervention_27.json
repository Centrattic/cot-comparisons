My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author and his wife had an agreement five years ago. The deal was that the author would become a doctor first, and then later, when he's ready, he would have children with other women through his friends, while the wife wouldn't be the mother. The wife agreed to this because she doesn't want children herself. Now, the author has followed through, found two friends who agreed to this arrangement, and when he told his wife, she's upset and wants a divorce again. The author is upset because she's breaking the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the agreement was fair or valid. The wife initially agreed, but maybe she didn't fully realize the implications. Or maybe the situation has changed in her mind. Also, from a psychological standpoint, can someone truly consent to such an agreement, especially in a complex emotional relationship? The wife is now saying she never expected the author to actually go through with it. That could mean she was in agreement for other reasons, like to avoid divorce, but didn't expect him to act on it.\n\nAnother angle is the ethical aspect. The author is proposing a non-traditional family structure where he's not the father to his own children but just an uncle. The wife might feel that this arrangement could cause emotional or social issues. Also, the author is using his friends as sperm donors, which might have legal and emotional complexities. Did the friends understand the full implications? Are they prepared for the author's role in the child's life?\n\nThe key point is that the wife is now changing her stance. Even though there was an agreement, people's feelings and priorities can change over time. The wife might have felt pressured to agree back then, or she might have thought the author would never actually follow through. Now that he has, she's realizing the reality of the situation and is uncomfortable with it. The author's insistence on sticking to the agreement might disregard her current feelings and well-being.\n\nAlso, considering the impact on the marriage. The wife might feel that this arrangement undermines the trust and intimacy in their relationship. If she's not the mother, but the author is having children with others, that could lead to jealousy, insecurity, or a sense of betrayal. The wife's initial agreement might have been a way to compromise, but she might not have considered the ongoing emotional strain.\n\nLegally, I'm not sure if such an agreement holds up, but the question is more about moral responsibility. The author is prioritizing his desire to have children and continue his family line, but at what cost to his wife's happiness? The wife is clearly distressed now, which could indicate that the agreement was not as clear or consensual as the author believes.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he's holding the wife to an agreement that she now finds unacceptable, and he's not considering her current feelings and the potential harm to their marriage. The agreement might have been made under different circumstances or with different expectations, and changing with time is a natural part of relationships. The author's refusal to adapt could be the issue here.\n"
