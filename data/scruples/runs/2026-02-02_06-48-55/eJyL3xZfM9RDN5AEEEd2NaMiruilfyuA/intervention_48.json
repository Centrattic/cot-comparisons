My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple who made a deal five years ago where the husband agreed to have children with other people if the wife didn't want to be a mother. Now, after the husband has become a doctor and two friends have agreed to this arrangement, the wife is upset and wants a divorce because she didn't expect her husband to actually follow through.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband wanted children, the wife didn't. They made an agreement where he would have kids with others, not being the father but possibly being an uncle. The wife thought this was a hypothetical deal and now is shocked when he's found people. The question is whether the author (husband) is wrong for expecting her to stick to the agreement.\n\nHmm. The wife's original agreement was under the condition that the husband would have kids with others. But maybe she didn't mean for it to actually happen. She might have thought it was a way to keep the marriage going without committing to children. Now, when he's actually pursuing this, she's appalled. So the issue is whether the husband's expectations were reasonable based on their agreement.\n\nBut agreements like this can be tricky. If it's a legally binding contract, maybe, but in personal relationships, things can change. The wife might have felt pressured at the time to agree to avoid divorce. Also, having children with other people is a significant ethical and emotional issue. The husband's commitment to having kids and passing on his genes might conflict with the wife's comfort and values.\n\nThe wife's reaction now could be because she realized the implications of the agreement. She might feel that the husband is treating her as a secondary parent or that the arrangement is emotionally exploitative. Also, the friends involved are other people, which adds complexity. The husband's friends agreeing to have his children could have their own motivations, and the husband's role as a non-father could lead to complications in the child's life.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the husband might have thought he was honoring the agreement, but the wife's current distress suggests that the agreement wasn't fully understood or accepted by her. People's feelings and circumstances can change over time, and maybe the agreement wasn't thorough enough. The husband's persistence in following through despite the wife's changed stance could be seen as not respecting her current wishes, hence putting him in the wrong.\n\nBut then again, if they made a mutual agreement years ago, the wife's later change of heart is also a factor. However, emotional and ethical considerations might outweigh the literal terms of the agreement. The husband's actions could be harming the wife and others, so maybe he is in the wrong for proceeding without considering the emotional impact.\n"
