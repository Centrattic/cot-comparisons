My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author and his wife made a deal five years ago where he would have children with other women once he became a doctor, while they stay married. Now that he's found two friends who are okay with this, his wife is upset and wants to break the agreement. The author is upset because he thought they had a clear agreement, but she's changing her mind.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They met when he was in med school, and they agreed that they would wait until he finished his education and had a stable career to have children. The wife didn't want children, so they made an agreement where he could have children with other women while they stay married. The key point here is that the author believes they had a mutual agreement, and now the wife is going back on it.\n\nBut there are some ethical and emotional issues here. The agreement itself is pretty unconventional. It's a form of contract that allows the author to father children outside the marriage, which is a big deal. Even though they are staying married, the wife is essentially giving up her role as a mother while allowing her husband to have children with others. That's a significant compromise from her side, given that she doesn't want children. \n\nNow, the wife is upset that the author actually found people willing to go through with this. She says she never expected her husband to follow through and that she had hoped he would give up. This could indicate that the wife might not have fully considered the implications of the agreement or that she was in denial about the reality of the situation. However, people can change their minds, especially in such a complex and emotionally charged scenario.\n\nThe author might feel wronged because he thought they had a binding agreement, but agreements in personal and intimate matters can be fluid. The wife might have felt pressured into the agreement initially, especially if she was in a vulnerable position or the author was being very insistent. Also, the author is using his wife's initial agreement as a justification, but the wife's current feelings might be valid if she's now realizing the emotional toll of such an arrangement. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and whether the agreement was truly mutual and informed. If the wife felt she had no choice given the author's strong stance on having children, that's a red flag. Moreover, the author is taking advantage of his wife's position without considering her potential emotional distress. Even if they had an agreement, the wife's right to change her mind later, especially regarding such a personal matter, is important.\n\nAdditionally, the legal and ethical implications of the agreement are questionable. Having children with other women while married to someone who doesn't want children could lead to legal complexities, especially regarding child support and the child's relationship with the parents. The author might be assuming that the wife's consent covers all these aspects, but that's not necessarily the case.\n\nIn summary, while the author believed they had an agreement, the wife's current reaction shows that such agreements in personal relationships can be unstable and influenced by changing emotions and circumstances. The author's insistence on following through despite the wife's change of heart might be seen as disregarding her feelings and the fluidity of their relationship dynamics. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not acknowledging the wife's right to reassess her position and for pushing forward with a plan that now causes her distress.\n"
