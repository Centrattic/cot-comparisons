My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a medical student who met his wife when he was in med school. They agreed that they would have children once he finished his training and had a stable job. His wife, at the time, was okay with this plan. Then, a few years later, the wife revealed she didn't want to have children. The author is very pro-children, so he considered divorce. However, he loved his wife very much and didn't want to leave her. So they came up with a compromise: in five years, when he's a full physician, he would ask his friends to have his child, with the author not being a father but possibly an uncle. The wife agreed to this five years ago. Now, when he's ready and two friends have agreed, the wife backs out, saying she never wanted him to have children with others and that she thought the deal was unrealistic. The author is upset and considering divorce again.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to stick to their five-year-old agreement. Let's look at the points from both sides.\n\nThe author's side: He made a plan with his wife to have children through alternative means if she didn't want to be a mother. He followed through with the plan, and the wife agreed to it. Now, she's backing out, which he sees as breaking their agreement. He wanted to have children and pass on his genes, which is important to him. He's also an only child, so there's emotional weight there.\n\nThe wife's side: She initially agreed under the assumption that maybe he would change his mind about children. She didn't expect the friends to agree. She feels betrayed and shocked that he actually went through with the plan. She might have thought the deal was a temporary solution or a way to avoid immediate divorce, not a long-term commitment. Her not wanting children is a key part of her stance, and now she's facing a reality where her partner is having children with others, which she didn't foresee.\n\nNow, considering ethics and relationships. In a relationship, agreements need mutual consent and understanding. When they made the deal five years ago, the wife might not have anticipated the actual actions involved. Maybe she thought it was a hypothetical or a way to keep their marriage intact without fully considering the implications. The author, on the other hand, took it seriously and followed through, believing the agreement was binding.\n\nBut relationships can change over time. People's feelings and priorities might shift. However, the author's main issue is that he expected the wife to hold up her end of the deal. The wife now sees it as unrealistic or something she never truly agreed to. Maybe she agreed under pressure to avoid divorce, not fully committing to the plan. In that case, she's not in the wrong for changing her mind.\n\nBut the author's expectation was that they had a valid agreement. The problem is that the wife's change of heart is causing conflict. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting her to stick to the deal.\n\nAlso, the method of having children through friends introduces other ethical issues, like the friends' consent, the potential child's well-being, and the dynamics with the wife. However, the main focus here is on the agreement between the author and his wife.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if they made a deal in good faith, then both should honor it. However, if the wife's agreement was not fully informed or if she didn't understand the consequences, then she's not at fault. The author might have assumed the agreement was clear, but the wife's perspective is that she thought it was a hypothetical solution, not a real plan. This could mean the author didn't properly vet the agreement's terms with her, leading to misunderstandings.\n\nAnother angle is that the author placed a significant emotional and ethical burden on his wife. Expecting her to accept a situation where her husband has children with others, even if he's not the legal father, might be more than she's willing to handle. Her initial agreement might have been based on a different understanding of what the future would hold.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he assumed the agreement was binding without ensuring that the wife fully understood and accepted the terms. Alternatively, if the agreement was clear and mutual, then the wife is in the wrong for breaking it.\n\nBut since the wife's statement after five years is that she never thought he'd actually get friends to agree, it suggests that the original agreement wasn't as concrete as the author thought. Therefore, the author's expectation might be misplaced, making him at fault for not considering her perspective and the realistic challenges of the plan. The wife had the right to change her mind once she realized the plan's implications, especially if she never truly agreed to it.\n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to uphold a deal that she didn't fully commit to at the time.\n"
