My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple who made an agreement five years ago, but now the wife is upset when the husband follows through with it after fulfilling the conditions. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple met while the husband was in med school. They agreed that having kids would wait until he finished his training. The wife didn't want children, but they made a deal: he'd have kids with other people once he's established as a doctor. Now, five years later, he's able to do that and found two friends willing to participate. The wife is appalled and wants to divorce because she didn't expect him to follow through.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. The husband believed they had an agreement. He followed through once he became a physician. The wife, however, didn't anticipate he'd actually find people to agree. She argues that she didn't truly consent to this arrangement, maybe thinking it was a hypothetical solution.\n\nPossible angles: Was the agreement mutual and clear? Did the wife understand the full implications? Maybe she thought it was a fallback plan, not a serious commitment. The husband might have thought he was honoring their deal, but the wife feels betrayed because the reality is different from her expectations. Also, the arrangement itself is ethically questionable, involving third parties and lack of paternal involvement. \n\nAnother point is emotional vs. practical consent. The wife might have agreed to the concept in theory but not the actual execution. The husband's actions could be seen as violating trust, even if there was a prior agreement. The wife's change of heart now might be about the emotional impact of the situation rather than the initial agreement.\n\nIn terms of moral or ethical responsibility, even if there was an agreement, the wife's current feelings and the potential harm to the relationship are important. The husband's desire to have children is personal, but imposing this on his wife and involving others could be problematic. The fact that the wife is now appalled suggests that the agreement wasn't fully understood or accepted by her.\n\nAlso, the husband's solution of using friends as sperm donors without being present as a father raises questions about the children's well-being and the ethical implications of such an arrangement. The wife might feel that this isn't a responsible or sustainable solution, leading to her opposition now.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions might be seen as violating the spirit of their agreement, even if they thought they had an explicit deal. The wife's reaction indicates that the agreement wasn't as binding as the husband believed. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for proceeding without considering his wife's true feelings and the ethical consequences.\n"
