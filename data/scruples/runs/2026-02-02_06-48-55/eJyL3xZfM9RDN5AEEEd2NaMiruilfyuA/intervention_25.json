My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nSo, the author is a doctor who's been married for a few years. They made a deal five years ago when they got married. The original plan was to wait until he finished school and residency to have kids. His wife didn't want kids at all, but they agreed that he could have kids with other people once he was a full physician. Now, five years later, he found two friends who agreed to this arrangement. But his wife is upset and doesn't want to go through with the deal anymore. She says she never expected him to actually find someone who would agree, and she's appalled. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong for expecting her to honor the deal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of consent and agreements in a marriage. When they made the deal five years ago, both parties were in agreement. The wife agreed at the time. So, from a contractual standpoint, he's following through on what they agreed. However, relationships can change, and people's feelings might evolve. The wife might have thought that the deal was a way to avoid divorce but didn't expect him to actually implement it. There's a question here about whether the agreement was a serious, binding commitment or a temporary compromise during a difficult time.\n\nAnother angle is the nature of the agreement. Having children with other people is a significant life decision, and the wife's current reaction suggests she's uncomfortable. Even though she agreed before, maybe she misunderstood the full implications or thought it was a hypothetical. The emotional aspect is important here\u2014does the wife's current discomfort make the author in the wrong?\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning: he chose this option because he loves his wife and doesn't want to leave her, but he wants children. The wife now sees this arrangement as unacceptable. There's a lack of communication here. Did the author check in with her after making the arrangements with his friends? Or did he proceed without discussing the details again?\n\nEthically, the author might be in the wrong if the agreement was made under pressure or during a crisis (the divorce threat). If the wife felt coerced into agreeing, then the author's expectation for her to honor it now is unfair. On the other hand, if the agreement was mutual and clear, then the author isn't wrong for following through.\n\nBut the wife's current reaction indicates she didn't foresee the practicality of the deal. Maybe she thought it was a joke or a hypothetical solution. The author, however, took it seriously and acted on it. So, the question is whether both parties had a shared understanding of the agreement's terms.\n\nIn terms of legal perspective, if they had a written agreement, it might be enforceable, but since it's a verbal agreement, it's more about mutual consent. The problem is that one party is now backing out, possibly due to changed feelings.\n\nEmotionally, the wife's betrayal and discomfort are valid. The author's actions could be seen as violating the trust and emotional boundaries, even if there was an agreement. The children would be raised by others, but the fact that the author is funding them and visiting complicates things. The wife might feel that this arrangement undermines the sanctity of their marriage and introduces third parties into their personal matters.\n\nSo, considering all these factors: the original agreement was under pressure, the wife's current discomfort, the lack of ongoing communication, and the emotional impact. It's possible that the author overstepped, expecting a verbal agreement made during a crisis to be binding without considering the wife's evolving feelings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
