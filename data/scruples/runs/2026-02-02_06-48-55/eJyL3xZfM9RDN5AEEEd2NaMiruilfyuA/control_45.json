My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and his wife made a deal five years ago. The deal was that since he wanted kids and she didn't, he would have children with other people through his friends, with specific terms like not being a father but maybe being an uncle, and providing child support. Now that he's a physician and has two friends who agreed, his wife is upset and breaking the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The original agreement was made under the premise that the wife didn't want to be a mother but wanted to stay married. The author wanted to have children, so they came up with this alternative. Now, the wife is going back on the agreement, which the author finds unfair. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the agreement itself, there's something odd. The wife agreed to not being a mother but allowed the husband to have children with others. But when the time came and the husband had friends who agreed, she was appalled. She claims she never expected him to actually go through with it. The author feels betrayed because she broke the agreed-upon plan.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, they made a private agreement. But in terms of ethics, there are a few factors. The wife's initial agreement was under the conditions where the husband was in med school and not in a stable position. Maybe she thought he would change his mind or that the situation would resolve differently. Now, five years later, she's changed her stance. But did she have the right to expect the situation to change? The husband might argue that he was following through with the plan they mutually agreed upon.\n\nHowever, the proposal involves him having children with other people. That's a huge ethical issue in itself. Even if there was an agreement, the husband using his friends as sperm donors for children he's not going to be a father to but will pay for sounds problematic. The friends' consent might be there, but the wife's emotional and psychological well-being is also a factor. She's in a marriage, and this arrangement could be seen as violating the trust and exclusivity that a marriage typically entails.\n\nAlso, the fact that the wife didn't anticipate her husband following through suggests that she might not have fully considered the terms when she agreed. Maybe she thought it was a hypothetical discussion, not a binding agreement. The husband, on the other hand, took it seriously and acted on it. That could mean the wife was in the wrong for changing her mind, but the husband's actions also have ethical implications.\n\nAnother angle: the husband's desire to pass on his genes is valid, but the method he chose is unconventional and potentially harmful. The wife's refusal to be a mother is her choice, but enabling him to have children with others might not be a fair compromise. It's possible that the original agreement was a temporary solution that both parties didn't fully commit to. Now, with the reality of the situation, the wife is realizing the consequences and backing out.\n\nIn terms of fault, maybe both parties have some responsibility. The wife agreed to terms she didn't fully consider, and the husband proceeded without checking if those terms were still acceptable. But the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. The author is following through with a plan that the wife initially agreed to, even if she later changed her mind. However, the fact that the husband is using non-consenting third parties (even if friends consented) might be ethically wrong regardless of the agreement. The wife is now objecting, which could mean the husband is overstepping by enforcing the agreement without considering her changed perspective.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the agreement itself is ethically questionable, and the wife's right to change her mind after five years should be respected. The husband's actions could be seen as pressuring his friends into a situation that's not standard and ignoring his wife's current feelings despite the prior agreement.\n"
