My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author and his wife are in a long-term relationship. They made a deal five years ago when he was in med school. The deal was that once he finished his training and had a stable job, he would have children with other people, while the wife wouldn't be the mother. They agreed on this so the author could have children (since he wants to pass on his genes) and the wife wouldn't have to be a mother. The author is okay with not being a father, just an uncle-like figure, and he would provide child support. Now, five years later, he's ready, found two friends willing to go along, but his wife is upset and breaking the agreement.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points.\n\nThe original agreement was made under certain circumstances. At the time, the wife agreed because she didn't want children and the author wanted to have them. But now, when the time comes to execute the plan, she's backing out. The author is following through on his end, but she's not honoring the deal. \n\nHowever, there are some complexities. The author is in a committed marriage, and this arrangement involves having children with other people. This is not a typical situation. The wife initially agreed, but her feelings might have changed, or she might not have realized the implications. Also, the author is entering into relationships with friends to have children, which could affect those friendships and the friends' families. The husbands of the female friends might have issues, even if they agreed. Also, the author's wife is now upset about the situation, perhaps because she didn't expect the friends to agree, or she's uncomfortable with the reality of the plan.\n\nLegally and ethically, this is a gray area. The agreement was between the couple, but involving third parties complicates things. The wife might feel betrayed because the plan was theoretical, and now it's becoming real. The author might feel wronged because he's following through on a promise made to him. However, the wife's consent now is crucial. Even if they made a deal, if she's not comfortable now, does he have the right to proceed?\n\nAnother angle: the wife never wanted to be a mother, but she might have agreed under the assumption that the author would find another way to have children. But the method they agreed on\u2014using other women\u2014might not have been fully thought through. The wife might not have considered the emotional impact of the author having children with others while they remain married. That could be a breach of trust or expectations of exclusivity in the marriage.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about wanting to pass on his genes is personal, but it's important to consider the wife's feelings. The marriage is a partnership, and major decisions like this require mutual agreement. If the wife is now against it, even if they had an agreement, the author might need to reconsider. But the author might feel that the wife is breaking the agreement, hence considering divorce again.\n\nThere's also the aspect of legal and social norms. Having children with others while married is not typical and could lead to complications. The author's friends might have their own reservations when it comes to the actual execution, even if they agreed in principle. The author is also offering child support, which is good, but the arrangement's legality and the emotional impact on all parties involved are factors.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is following through on a prior agreement, but the wife is now changing her stance. The author's actions might be seen as fulfilling a promise, but if the wife's consent was not fully informed or is now withdrawn, it could be problematic. The key here is whether the agreement was mutual and if both parties are still in agreement now.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the wife agreed five years ago but now feels differently, the author might be acting in bad faith by proceeding. The wife's current discomfort might indicate that the original agreement wasn't fully considered, or that she didn't realize the implications. The author might be expecting her to stick to an agreement she's no longer comfortable with, which could be seen as unfair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her current feelings and the situation has evolved beyond their original understanding.\n"
