My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out who's in the wrong here. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for expecting his wife to honor the deal they made five years ago. \n\nFirst, let's recap the situation. The couple got married five years ago. The husband was in med school and didn't want kids until he was established. The wife agreed. But later, she revealed she never wanted kids. They didn't break up because they love each other. Instead, they made an agreement: the husband would have children with other women (friends) while staying married to his wife. The wife would handle the children, and he wouldn't be a father. Now, after five years, the husband has two friends willing to be mothers, but the wife backs out of the deal, and the husband is upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are the agreement between them. The wife agreed to the deal, but now she's backing out. The author is upset because she's not following through. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the husband's perspective: He wanted kids but his wife didn't. To reconcile this, they made a deal where he could have kids with others, and she would support it. He followed through, found friends, and now she's rejecting the agreement. He feels she's breaking their agreement.\n\nFrom the wife's side, she agreed five years ago but now realizes she's uncomfortable with the idea. Maybe she didn't fully understand the implications back then, or she changed her mind. She might feel pressured or that the deal was made under different circumstances. She could be re-evaluating her own values or the reality of the situation.\n\nEthically, agreements between spouses can be tricky. While they made a deal, it's important to consider if both parties understood and consented to all terms. The wife might have agreed under the assumption that the husband wouldn't actually go through with it, or she might not have considered the emotional impact. Also, involving third parties in such a personal matter raises questions about consent and the well-being of the children.\n\nAnother angle is that the husband is using his wife to fulfill his desire for children without her being a mother, which could be seen as exploitative. The wife might not have realized she would be solely responsible for the children, and the husband's desire for offspring might not consider her feelings now. Additionally, the children would have a complex family situation, which could have long-term effects on their upbringing.\n\nThe husband's argument is that the wife agreed, so he's not wrong. But the wife's argument is that the situation is now unacceptable to her. The problem here is whether a verbal agreement made in a specific context (when both were in agreement) can be binding, especially when it involves such personal and ethical decisions.\n\nAlso, the fact that the wife is now \"appalled\" suggests that she might not have fully considered the implications at the time. Maybe she thought the deal was a way to avoid divorce but didn't intend for it to be carried out. The husband might have taken her agreement at face value, but her change of heart now complicates things.\n\nIn terms of legal standpoint, such an agreement isn't legally binding, so the wife can change her mind. But ethically, the husband is relying on a past agreement to justify his actions. The wife's change of heart might be reasonable, especially if she didn't anticipate the emotional or practical challenges.\n\nSo, considering all this, the husband might be in the wrong because he proceeded with plans that the wife is now against. Even though they had an agreement, it's possible that the wife's consent wasn't fully informed or that the situation has evolved in a way that makes the original agreement invalid. The husband's actions now could be seen as pressuring his wife into a situation she's not comfortable with, which isn't fair.\n"
