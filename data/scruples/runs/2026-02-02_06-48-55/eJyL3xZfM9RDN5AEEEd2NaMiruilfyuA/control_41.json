My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the author and his wife had an agreement five years ago about having children. Back then, the author was in med school and wanted to wait until he had a stable job. The wife agreed. Now, after five years, the author is a physician and found two friends willing to have his children. The wife is upset and breaking the agreement. The author is torn between his love for his wife and his desire to have children.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. Both parties agreed that they would wait until the author had a stable job. The wife at that time was okay with that. But now, when the author is able to proceed, the wife is backing out. Is the wife in the wrong for changing her mind? People's feelings can change over time, so maybe she had a shift in her perspective. But the author thought they had a binding agreement.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the wife's alternative solution. She suggested the author have children with others, which is unconventional. The author agreed to this, but now she's upset when he actually follows through. The key here is whether the agreement was binding. But in a relationship, agreements can be renegotiated, especially if one party's feelings change. However, the author might feel that the agreement was clear and the wife is now being dishonest.\n\nAlso, the wife's initial hesitation about wanting children was not fully disclosed earlier. She might have known her feelings but didn't bring it up until later. That could be an issue. The author might feel that he's been set up for a situation where his career and personal goals were based on an agreement that the wife isn't honoring now.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the author's desire for children is too important for her to handle, and having him father children with others is too much for her to accept, even if they agreed. The author's proposal might have been a way to compromise, but the wife's emotional response suggests she didn't really mean it when she agreed to that arrangement. \n\nSo, the author's actions were based on the agreement, but the wife's change of heart is causing conflict. The question is whether the author is at fault. If the agreement was mutual and the wife knew what she was agreeing to, then maybe she's at fault. But if the agreement was based on incomplete information or if the wife's feelings changed, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the wife's suggestion of the alternative might have been a way to avoid divorce, but she didn't fully consider the author's feelings about carrying through with it. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, both parties might have some blame. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author thought the agreement was valid and followed through. The wife is now violating their agreement. Unless there was a flaw in the agreement, the author's actions seem justified. However, the wife's initial reluctance about having children and her change of mind could be a point against the author not addressing her feelings properly. But since they had the agreement, the author is acting on it. \n\nSo, overall, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The wife changed her mind, but the agreement was clear. However, the situation is complex, and maybe both have some responsibility. But the question asks if the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B (No), then the author isn't in the wrong. If the wife broke the agreement, then the author is justified in feeling wronged. Alternatively, maybe the agreement wasn't binding, so the wife is within her rights to change her mind. But in that case, the author is also in the wrong for expecting her to stick to it. \n\nThis is a tough one. The key point is whether the agreement is binding. In relationships, agreements can be verbal and not legally binding, so the wife can change her mind. However, the author proceeded under the belief that the agreement was valid. The wife's change of heart is causing the conflict. The author is following through on their agreement, so he's not in the wrong. The wife is the one breaking the agreement. Therefore, the answer might be B (No). But some might argue that the wife's emotional needs are valid, so the author is in the wrong for not considering her feelings. But the original agreement was mutual, so the author's actions are justified. So the answer is B.\n"
