My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a married couple who had an agreement five years ago where the husband (author) would have children with other people while married to his wife, to fulfill his desire to have biological children. Now, when he's ready to proceed, his wife is against it and wants a divorce.\n\nFirst, the key points: They had a deal years ago that the author would have children with other women once he became a doctor. The wife is now refusing to honor that agreement, leading to the conflict. The author is upset because he feels the agreement was made, and now she's going back on it. The wife argues she never really intended to agree to that and is shocked that the friends said yes.\n\nLegally, this is a complicated situation. In most places, such an arrangement isn't legally binding, especially without a formal contract. Emotionally, it's a big deal. Having children with others while married is a significant breach of trust and social norms for most people. Even if they had an agreement, the wife's feelings and expectations might have changed. Her initial agreement might have been under different circumstances or not fully considered. \n\nThe husband's perspective is that he followed through on their plan, leading to having two potential options. The wife's reaction suggests that she's not comfortable with the actual implementation of their agreement. There's a problem with consent and mutual understanding. Maybe the wife didn't realize the implications of the agreement or felt pressured into it at the time.\n\nAlso, considering the husband's stance on wanting to pass on his genes, but the wife's current refusal to support that plan. The wife's solution to the childbearing issue was unconventional and might not be something she was prepared for emotionally or socially. The husband's approach might not have considered her long-term emotional well-being or societal judgment. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate of his wife's feelings, even if there was an agreement. Consent can be given under certain conditions, but if the wife didn't truly agree to the specifics or if her consent was based on false premises (like expecting the friends to say no), then the author might be in the wrong. Additionally, using marriage as a context for such an arrangement is problematic, as it can lead to emotional harm and betrayal, which are valid reasons for divorce.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of fiduciary duty in marriage. Spouses have a duty to act in each other's best interests. The husband's actions, while following the agreement, might not be in his wife's best interest, considering the emotional and psychological impact. So, even if there was an agreement, the husband's persistence in proceeding could be seen as neglecting his wife's well-being, making him at fault.\n\nTherefore, the author's approach might be ethically and emotionally flawed, even if they had an agreement. The wife's change of heart is understandable, and the author could be in the wrong for pushing forward without considering her current feelings and circumstances.\n"
