My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The story is pretty complex. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife met when he was in med school. They agreed that having kids would be after he finished training. The wife agreed to this. Then, after a few years of marriage, the wife reveals she doesn't want kids. The author is heartbroken because he wants to have children. They make a deal: to avoid divorce, he'll have kids with other people when he's a full-time doctor. They worked out the details 5 years ago. Now that he's a doctor and has two friends who agreed, his wife is upset and says she never expected to accept that. He's upset she's going back on the agreement.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the original agreement and the current conflict. The author is upset because his wife is breaking the deal they made. But why did she agree to that deal in the first place? It seems like they were in a tough spot where both wanted to stay together, but had conflicting desires about children. The wife didn't want kids, but the author wanted them. The compromise was this unconventional arrangement.\n\nNow, the wife is saying she never really wanted that. Maybe she thought he would give up, or maybe she didn't fully agree. But they did make a formal agreement. However, maybe the agreement was made under pressure or wasn't realistic. For example, would having kids with other people actually work? The author is supposed to not be a father, just an uncle. But does that hold up? What if the mother changes her mind? Also, the wife's perspective is important. She might have agreed to avoid divorce but not actually be okay with it. \n\nAnother angle: the author's solution seems a bit unethical or legally complicated. Having children with friends to get his genes passed on while his wife is not the mother. That's a very specific arrangement that might not be legally recognized or protected. Also, the emotional impact on all involved\u2014his friends' families, the child, etc.\u2014could be significant. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to stick to the deal. The wife says she never expected him to find people willing to agree, so she didn't really accept the deal. So he went ahead and found people, thinking the deal was valid. Is the problem that the deal itself is unethical or impractical, or that he's holding her to it despite her changing her mind?\n\nI think the main issue here is that the agreement they made might not have been a realistic or healthy compromise. The wife might have agreed to avoid divorce but didn't truly consent to the terms. Now, when the author is following through, she's realizing the implications and is backtracking. The author expected her to stick to the agreement, but her initial consent might have been under duress or not fully thought through. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for pushing forward with something that she later realizes she can't live with, even if they made a deal. It's also possible that the agreement was based on a misunderstanding, and the wife's current stance is valid because the situation is more complex than they thought. So the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong, because forcing this arrangement on his wife, even under agreement, might not be fair, especially if her consent was not fully informed or if the deal is inherently problematic.\n"
