My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife had an agreement five years ago. The original deal was that they wouldn't have children until he finished his medical training, when he'd have a stable job. The wife agreed back then. However, the wife later revealed she doesn't want children at all. They had a conflict, and to avoid divorce, they made a new agreement where he would find other women (friends) to have his children, using donors, and he wouldn't be the father but could visit. Now, when he's ready and has two friends who agreed, the wife is upset and says she never expected him to go through with it.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the original agreement and the new one. The author is upset because the wife is breaking their agreement. The wife argues that she never really thought he'd find willing women and is now against the plan. \n\nBut wait, when they made the agreement, the wife might have agreed hypothetically, but didn't consider that he'd actually find people. Or maybe she misunderstood the terms. The author believed he was following through on their agreement, but the wife's change of heart now is causing conflict.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the agreement was made under specific circumstances. The wife might have thought it was a way to avoid divorce without fully committing to it. The author, on his part, acted on the agreement. However, there's a lot of ethical and emotional aspects here. The wife's consent might have been under pressure to avoid divorce, so it's possible the agreement wasn't fully voluntary. Also, creating children in this way might have unanticipated consequences. The wife's current reaction might be valid if she realizes the plan's implications that she didn't foresee before.\n\nBut legally and morally, once an agreement is made, both parties should honor it. However, if the wife's consent wasn't genuine or if the agreement was based on a misunderstanding, then the author might not be entirely at fault. It's a complex situation with both sides having valid points. However, the wife's feelings and the reality of the situation now matter. The author might be in a position where he's following the agreement, but the wife's change of heart is understandable given the circumstances. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's nuance. But according to the question, should he be in the wrong? If the agreement was made in good faith and both parties agreed, then he's not in the wrong. But if the agreement was based on a misunderstanding or if the wife's consent was not fully informed, then maybe he is. It's tricky.\n"
