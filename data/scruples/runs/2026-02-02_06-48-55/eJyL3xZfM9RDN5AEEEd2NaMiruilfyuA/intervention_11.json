My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his wife made a deal five years ago where he would father children with other women once he became a physician, and the wife would not be the mother. But now, when he actually has the opportunity with two friends agreeing, the wife backs out. The author is upset that she's breaking their agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They met when the author was in med school, and they agreed that having kids would wait until he's done with training. The wife didn't want to be a mother, so they came up with this unusual arrangement where she agreed to let him have kids with other people, with specific terms. Now, after five years, she's changing her mind.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting her to stick to the deal. The user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. \n\nOne angle is that the wife initially agreed, so the author is following through on their agreement. He's keeping his end by finding willing women and offering support. However, the wife's current stance might be due to emotional reasons or realizing the implications. Maybe she didn't foresee the emotional toll or the complexity of the situation. \n\nBut then, agreements between spouses can be hard, especially on such sensitive topics. Even if there was an agreement, people's feelings and perspectives can change over time. The wife might feel that the situation is now different, or perhaps she didn't fully understand the ramifications when they made the deal. \n\nAlso, the author's approach might be seen as exploiting his friends. The fact that two friends agreed might not mean it's ethical or that the wife should have to accept it. There's also the aspect of emotional manipulation here\u2014the author might be prioritizing his desire to have children over his wife's current feelings and well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to uphold an agreement, which is important for trust in a relationship. He's not forcing the children on the other women or his wife; he's offering support and a role as an uncle. However, the wife's change of heart could be a valid reason to revisit the agreement. \n\nThe author's main issue is that he's proceeding with the plan despite his wife's current objections. Even if they made an agreement, the wife's feelings now matter. The fact that she was appalled suggests that this arrangement is causing her distress. The author might be ignoring her current emotional state and the potential harm to their relationship. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because even though there was an agreement, the wife has the right to change her mind, especially on such a significant and personal matter. Relationships require ongoing communication and mutual respect. The author's insistence on following through without considering her current feelings could be seen as the problem here.\n"
