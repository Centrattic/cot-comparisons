My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding a situation where they made an agreement with their wife five years ago about having children through other women, and now she's backing out.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple agreed that the husband, who's in med school, would focus on his career, and they would have children later when he's a full-time doctor. But the wife doesn't want children. They made a compromise where the husband would have children with other women, acting as a sperm donor, and not a father, while the wife would be the mother figure. Now, after five years, the wife is upset that he found willing friends, and wants to reconsider the agreement.\n\nSo, the author (the husband) is asking if he's in the wrong for expecting the wife to stick to the agreement. The possible angles here are about consent, changing circumstances, and the nature of the agreement itself. \n\nFirst, consent is crucial. Did they both agree to the terms, and is the agreement valid? At the time, they both agreed, so he might think he's not in the wrong. However, agreements in personal relationships can be tricky. People's feelings and circumstances can change. The wife might feel that the situation is different now, or that the agreement was made under different understandings. \n\nAlso, the wife's perspective is important. She might feel that she never truly agreed to the part where he has children with others. Maybe she thought it was a hypothetical or a temporary solution. The fact that she's appalled now suggests she might not have fully considered or accepted the implications at the time. \n\nAnother point is the nature of the agreement. It's a unique situation\u2014using friends as surrogates. Even if they agreed, five years might have passed, and people's views can evolve. The wife's hesitation could be due to emotional or ethical reasons she didn't foresee before.\n\nThe husband's stance is that they made a deal, so he's standing by it. But the wife's current reaction shows she's not comfortable now. This is a conflict between honoring a past agreement versus addressing current feelings and circumstances. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's subjective. Legally, such agreements might not hold up, but morally, it's about mutual respect and understanding. The wife might now feel that the agreement was not fully thought through, or that the husband's expectations were unrealistic. The husband might feel wronged because he followed through as agreed. \n\nHowever, in a relationship, both parties need to communicate and adjust as needed. If the wife feels that the agreement is no longer acceptable, even if it was made in good faith, then the husband might need to reassess. The fact that she's now appalled suggests that the agreement might not have been as clear or acceptable as they both thought. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong if the agreement wasn't fully mutual or if the wife's current feelings are valid and legitimate. The situation is complex, but the key is that both parties need to renegotiate if circumstances have changed. The wife's change of heart might not be a betrayal but a reflection of her current values. Therefore, the author expecting her to stick to the original deal could be seen as not respecting her evolving perspective. \n\nBut I need to be careful here. The user is asking for a choice between A and B. The answer depends on whether the agreement was valid and if the wife's current stance is a legitimate change of heart. If the agreement was made with full understanding and both parties still agree, he's not in the wrong. However, if the wife's feelings have genuinely changed and the agreement wasn't a firm, binding contract, then the author might be in the wrong for expecting her to honor a past agreement that she now disagrees with. \n\nGiven that the wife said she never expected any of his friends to agree, perhaps she didn't take the agreement as seriously as the husband did. This could mean the agreement wasn't as solid as he thought. In that case, the husband is in the wrong for assuming the agreement was binding and not considering her current feelings. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
