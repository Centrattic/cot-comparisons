My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. The scenario involves a married couple who made an agreement five years ago about having children. The husband is a doctor who wanted kids, but his wife doesn't. They decided that once he's a full-time doctor, he would have children with his friends through a sort of arrangement where he isn't the legal father, just an uncle. Now, when he goes through with it, the wife is upset and wants a divorce again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband and wife made an agreement when they were married. The wife agreed to let him pursue fatherhood through other women once he's established in his career. But when he actually presents the option, she backs out. The question is, is the husband in the wrong for expecting her to uphold the deal?\n\nHmm. The wife's perspective is important here. She might have agreed under certain circumstances or with different expectations. Maybe she didn't realize how serious he was about this arrangement. Also, emotional and psychological factors come into play. Even if they made a deal, relationships can change over time. The wife's feelings about the situation might have evolved, and she might feel uncomfortable or violated by the actual execution of the plan.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband trusted the agreement they made. He followed through on his part by securing the friends' consent. He's acting on the understanding that she was okay with this arrangement. The problem is that their initial agreement was based on her not wanting children, but perhaps she didn't anticipate the emotional impact of her partner having children with others, even if it's not a traditional setup.\n\nAnother angle is the nature of the agreement itself. Was it a binding contract or just a verbal understanding? In marriages, agreements can be tricky. Also, the husband's approach involves third parties and child support, which adds complexity. The wife's reaction might stem from feelings of betrayal or insecurity, even if she initially agreed. Trust issues might arise because she's not comfortable with him having biological children with others, even if they're not legally his.\n\nI need to consider societal norms and ethical standards. Having children with friends while married is unconventional and might be seen as unethical or disrespectful to the wife. Even if there was an agreement, the husband might have prioritized his own desires without fully considering the emotional toll on his wife. The wife's change of heart could be a valid response if she feels the agreement was made under pressure or without full understanding.\n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning about wanting to pass on his genes is personal, but it's important to respect the other person's boundaries and evolving feelings. The wife's current distress suggests that the agreement might not have been fully thought through. She might have felt she had no choice at the time, leading to resentment later.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband had an agreement, the wife's emotional response and change of heart might indicate that the original deal wasn't as firm as he thought. The husband might be in the wrong for not recognizing that such a significant life decision requires ongoing communication and mutual consent, not just a past agreement. The wife has the right to her feelings now, even if they differ from the past.\n"
