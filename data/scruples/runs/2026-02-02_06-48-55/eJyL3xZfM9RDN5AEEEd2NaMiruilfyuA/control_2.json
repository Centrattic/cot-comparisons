My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the couple met when the author was in med school. They decided to have kids once he finished residency and had a stable job. The wife agreed. They got married, and years later, she revealed she doesn't want kids. The author wanted children and proposed a divorce, but the wife suggested an alternative: he could have kids with other people using her as the surrogate, with no father role. They made an agreement 5 years ago that if the friends agreed, he could proceed, and he would handle child support. Now, after 5 years, he has two friends who said yes, but the wife is against it now.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the agreement they made and the current conflict. The author is upset because the wife is breaking their agreement. The wife is shocked that the friends agreed, implying she never expected them to. She's now backing out of the original deal.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, I don't think their agreement would be enforceable. Marital agreements about such matters might not hold up, especially if it involves third parties. But the question is about moral wrong, not legal.\n\nMoral considerations: The author wants to have children, which is a personal desire. The wife didn't want kids but agreed to the compromise. However, now she's objecting because she didn't expect the friends to agree. Is she in the wrong for changing her mind? Or is the author wrong for expecting her to stick to the agreement, even if she might have misunderstood the likelihood of friends agreeing?\n\nThe wife might feel betrayed that the author is pursuing this arrangement, which could be emotionally complex. The author might feel the wife is breaking their agreement. But maybe the wife never truly intended to go along with it, thinking it was a hypothetical solution. If the author relied on her agreement, he might feel wronged. However, the wife's emotional response is valid too; she might not have considered the reality of the situation.\n\nAnother angle: The author is using his wife to fulfill his desire for children, which could be seen as selfish. Even if they agreed, the wife's current objection might indicate she's not comfortable with the arrangement anymore. The agreement was made under certain circumstances (maybe desperation to stay married), and now she's reevaluating.\n\nAlso, the author is offering financial support but not a father role. The mothers would be raising the child, which is a big commitment. The wife might feel she's being used as a surrogate, even if they agreed. There's a lack of third-party consent here; the friends' willingness doesn't mean the wife is okay with it now.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author expected the wife to honor the agreement, but if the wife's feelings were not fully considered or if the agreement was made under emotional stress, it's possible she's justified in changing her stance. The author might be in the wrong for not considering her potential discomfort once the situation became real.\n\nAlternatively, the author is acting on a prior agreement and the wife is backing out, which could mean she's in the wrong. But the complexity is that the agreement might have been based on unrealistic expectations (assuming friends would agree). The wife might have thought it was a theoretical solution, not an actual plan.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because the wife's current objection is valid, especially if the agreement was based on a misunderstanding of her true feelings. Or maybe the wife is in the wrong for breaking the agreement. It's a tough call, but the answer likely depends on the intention behind the original agreement and the wife's genuine feelings now.\n"
