My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to stick to a five-year-old agreement where they agreed he would have children with other people, given that she now objects.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband is a doctor who wanted children but his wife didn't. They made a deal where he would have children with others once he was established, and she agreed. Now, when he's ready and found willing partners, she's backing out. The key issue here is consent and the validity of the agreement over time.\n\nAgreements between spouses can be tricky, especially when they involve such personal and emotional decisions. Even if both parties agreed initially, circumstances and feelings can change. The wife might have had a change of heart or realized the implications of the agreement more clearly over time. Also, the nature of such an agreement\u2014allowing the husband to have children with others\u2014is inherently complex and can lead to emotional issues for everyone involved.\n\nThe husband is now upset because the wife isn't honoring the agreement. But the wife's reaction suggests she didn't anticipate the situation playing out as it did. She might have thought the probability of friends agreeing was low, or she might have re-evaluated her comfort level with the arrangement. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the husband's expectation that the agreement remains valid without considering her current feelings might be the problem. People's values and desires can evolve, and expecting someone to stick to an agreement from years ago without reassessing could be seen as unreasonable. The wife's change of heart isn't just about the agreement itself but also about the emotional and ethical aspects of the situation now that it's becoming a reality.\n\nAdditionally, the husband's plan to have children with other people while married, even with agreements about not being a father, is unconventional and might not have been fully considered by the wife in the long term. It's possible that the initial agreement was made under different circumstances, and the wife didn't foresee the emotional impact of the husband successfully finding partners.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties might share some blame. The husband might have pushed for the agreement without fully considering her potential future discomfort, and the wife might not have communicated her reservations earlier. However, the key point is that the wife is now objecting, and the husband is holding her to an old agreement. This suggests that the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her current feelings and for not recognizing that her initial agreement might not have been fully informed about the long-term implications.\n"
