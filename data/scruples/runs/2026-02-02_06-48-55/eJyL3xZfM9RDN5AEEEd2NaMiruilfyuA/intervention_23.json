My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The story is about a couple who made an agreement five years ago where the husband would father children with other women, and now the wife is upset that he actually arranged for two friends to do this.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The key points are that the author (the husband) wanted children, but his wife didn't. They agreed to a deal where she would let him have children with others once he became a doctor. Now, after five years, he's approached two friends who agreed, and the wife is against this. She feels betrayed and wants to divorce again.\n\nI need to consider ethics here. The author is using his friends as sperm donors, even though he's married. The wife's agreement was under the condition that he wouldn't proceed with this, but now she's against it. The problem here might be that the agreement itself was unethical or unrealistic. Maybe the wife didn't truly consent to such an arrangement, or the author didn't consider the emotional impact on everyone involved, including the friends who agreed to be sperm donors. Also, the author is using his friends in a way that might exploit their willingness to help, especially since the author is offering child support but not being a father. The friends might be in a vulnerable position because of their relationship with him.\n\nAnother angle is the initial agreement. The wife might have felt pressured into the deal when she was in a vulnerable position, maybe during a time when she was trying to maintain the marriage. The author might have taken her agreement too literally and not considered her feelings over time. The wife's change of heart could indicate that the agreement wasn't a solid one, and she didn't mean to fully go through with it. The author's actions might be violating the trust and emotional boundaries, even if there was a verbal agreement.\n\nAlso, the author's friends agreeing to this could be problematic. They might not have considered the long-term implications or the emotional dynamics. The author might be putting his friends in a complicated situation, and the children involved could face identity issues later. The author's approach seems to prioritize his own desire for children without fully considering the ethical implications on all parties.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, while there might be some legal agreements (like child support), the ethical issues are more about consent and emotional well-being. The wife's current stance suggests that the agreement was not thought through properly. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't foresee how the situation would play out and went ahead with it despite the wife's apparent discomfort.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions seem ethically questionable. He made an agreement based on a complex and sensitive issue, but didn't account for the possibility that the other party (his wife) might not have fully intended to follow through. Additionally, involving friends in such a personal and emotional matter without fully considering their well-being and the potential consequences could be seen as wrong.\n"
