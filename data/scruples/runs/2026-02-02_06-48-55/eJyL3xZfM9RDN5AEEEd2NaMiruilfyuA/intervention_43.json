My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple who had an agreement five years ago about having children. The husband wanted kids, the wife didn't. They agreed that the husband would have children with other people when he becomes a doctor, and the wife would handle the pregnancy and child-rearing, with him acting as an uncle. Now, after five years, the husband found two friends who agreed to this arrangement, but the wife is upset and wants a divorce again.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethics here. The couple made a specific agreement, and the husband followed through. The wife is breaking their agreement now, which seems to be the crux of the problem. But there's more nuance. The wife initially didn't want children, so the compromise was for her to be the mother and the husband to have no fathering role. Now, she's rejecting the plan because she thought it was unrealistic, but she went along with it five years ago. That's a key point.\n\nThe husband's actions seem to adhere to the agreement they made, even though the method (using friends) is unconventional. The wife's change of heart might be due to new moral considerations she hadn't considered before. But she agreed to the plan then, so why the change now? It's possible that she realized the emotional and social complexities of the arrangement, which might not be feasible in reality. However, the agreement was mutual, so the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for following through. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's plan could be seen as manipulative. He's using his wife to carry his children, which could lead to emotional distress for all parties involved. The wife might have felt pressured into the agreement initially, thinking it was a temporary solution. Now, after five years, she might have realized the long-term implications and feels trapped. \n\nBut the original agreement was mutual, so the husband isn't violating any promises. The wife's current stance might be more about a change of heart rather than the husband's fault. However, the ethical issue here is whether the agreement was fair in the first place. Surrogacy and such arrangements usually require legal and emotional agreements, which they might not have properly addressed. The husband's friends agreeing to this could also have their own reasons, and the situation might be more complicated than they anticipated.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband followed through with the agreement he and his wife made. The wife is now changing her mind, which might be a result of unforeseen circumstances or a deeper reflection on the agreement. The husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for adhering to their original plan, but the situation is ethically complex. The answer is B (Not in the wrong), but there's a lot to unpack here.\n"
