My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for expecting his wife to honor a 5-year-old agreement about having children through other women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. The couple made an agreement when they were in a different life phase. The wife didn't want children, and the husband did. To compromise, they agreed that in five years, he would have children with his friends, not being the legal father but possibly involved as an uncle. Now, when the time came, the wife is upset that he's following through with the plan.\n\nThe key points here are consent and the nature of the agreement. Initially, the wife agreed to the plan, but maybe she didn't fully understand the implications or had a change of heart. However, agreements made in the past can be revisited, especially if circumstances have changed. The wife might feel that the agreement was made under pressure or misunderstanding, especially since she later found out she didn't want children at all. The husband's desire to have children is valid, but the method might be problematic. Using friends as sperm donors without a legal or emotional framework could lead to issues for all parties involved. The wife's reaction now suggests she feels the agreement is unrealistic or unethical. The husband might be in the wrong if the agreement was based on false premises or if the wife's consent was not fully informed. Alternatively, if the agreement was mutual and the wife is breaking it, he might not be in the wrong. But considering the ethical implications and the wife's change of stance, it's possible the author is overstepping by proceeding without her current consent.\n"
