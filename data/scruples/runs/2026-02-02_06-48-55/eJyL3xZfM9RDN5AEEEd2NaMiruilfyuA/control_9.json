My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on a complex situation. The author and his wife made a deal five years ago where she agreed he could have children with other people once he became a doctor. Now, she's upset when he actually follows through with the plan.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple made an agreement based on their future plans. The wife initially agreed to the plan when he was in med school, so she knew this might happen. But now, after five years, she's changed her mind. That's a big point. Agreements can be broken, but the author is frustrated because she's going back on what they both agreed to.\n\nThe wife's current reasoning is that she never expected him to find people willing to go along with this. But the author did find two couples who agreed. The wife's shock now suggests that maybe she didn't take the agreement seriously or thought he wouldn't follow through. However, the author did keep his end of the deal.\n\nAnother angle is the ethical aspect. The author wants to have children, which is his personal choice, but using his friends in this way might affect their relationships. The friends in question are either married (with infertility issues) or single and planning to use a sperm donor, so maybe they are more open to the idea. But the author is considering being a sperm donor without being a father, which might be a different dynamic.\n\nThe wife's main issue is that she didn't realize how feasible the plan would be. She might have thought he'd give up when it didn't work out. But since he found people, she's upset. The author is now considering divorce again because she's breaking the agreement.\n\nIn terms of fault, the author kept his part of the deal, but the wife is changing her position. However, the original agreement might have been based on mutual understanding, but perhaps the wife's expectations weren't clearly communicated. She might have thought the plan was just a hypothetical or that he wouldn't actually proceed. The author, on the other hand, took the agreement seriously and followed through.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the agreement was mutual and the wife knew the plan, then she might have a responsibility to honor it. But if the agreement was flawed or based on misunderstandings, then maybe the wife isn't wrong. However, the author's actions are within the bounds of their original agreement, so he might not be in the wrong. The wife's change of heart complicates things, but the author isn't violating any terms he agreed to.\n"
