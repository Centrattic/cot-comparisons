My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is complex. So, the author and his wife married after he was in med school. They agreed that having kids would wait until he's a full-time physician. The wife later revealed she doesn't want kids. He wants to have children, so they made a deal five years ago where he would father children through friends, with the wife handling the child support and not being a father. Now, two friends agreed, but the wife is upset and wants a divorce because she says she didn't expect him to go through with it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the agreement between them. They made a deal five years back, but the wife is now going back on it. The author is upset because he followed through and found people who agreed. But the wife's initial agreement might not have been fully understood. Wait, when they made the deal, the wife's main issue was not wanting to be a mother. She might have thought that by letting him have children outside the marriage, she could avoid that role. However, she now claims she never expected him to actually find people to agree. That's a problem because if the agreement was made in good faith, then both sides should honor it unless there's a valid reason to rescind it.\n\nBut there's another angle. The wife is now objecting to the actual execution of the plan. Maybe she didn't foresee the emotional or social implications of him having children with others. Also, the original agreement might have been based on her hope that he would change his mind. She confessed she hoped he would, which complicates things. So, maybe the author shouldn't have assumed her agreement was final when she had reservations all along. \n\nAnother point: the wife is now appalled that the friends agreed. She might feel betrayed or that the situation isn't as simple as he thought. The author's solution of not being a father but being an uncle could be seen as irresponsible or causing future complications. The wife might not have considered the long-term effects on the children or their own relationship dynamics. \n\nAlso, the author's motivation is about passing on his genes and family line. That's personal, but it's important to consider mutual respect in a marriage. Even if they agreed to the plan, if the wife is now against it, maybe the agreement wasn't as solid as he thought. The fact that she had reservations from the start and later agreed under the condition that it might not happen because she hoped friends would refuse? That seems like she might have been holding out, thinking it was a temporary solution.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is using his wife's initial agreement, but if she didn't really mean it and is now withdrawing, he might be in the wrong for pressuring her to stay in a marriage while he goes ahead with this plan. Also, involving other people's friends in this arrangement raises questions about consent and the potential for future issues. The wife might feel that the deal is unrealistic or that he's not considering her feelings now.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because the agreement was based on her initial reluctant agreement, and now she's withdrawing support. Plus, the plan itself is ethically questionable, involving third parties and not being a father, which could lead to complications. The wife's change of heart might be valid, especially if the original deal wasn't fully thought out or if she didn't realize the consequences.\n"
