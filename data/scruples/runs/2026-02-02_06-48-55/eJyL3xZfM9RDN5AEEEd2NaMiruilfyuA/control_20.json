My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his wife made an agreement five years ago where he would become a father through other people when he was a full-time doctor. Now, he's found two friends who agreed, but his wife is upset and wants to break the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics of their relationship. They met when he was in med school, and he was focused on his career, so they agreed children would come later when he had a stable job. The wife didn't want kids, but they made a deal where he would have children through his friends. Now, he's in a position to do that, but she's changed her mind and is against it.\n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong for expecting her to stick to the deal. From his perspective, they had an agreement, and he's following through. She's now backing out, which he sees as a betrayal. But she's saying she never really expected him to follow through, maybe because she thought it was unrealistic.\n\nI need to consider if agreements in relationships can be binding, especially when it comes to such a significant decision as having children. Also, there's the aspect of emotional honesty. Did the wife know the full implications of the agreement when she made it? If she agreed under the assumption that he wouldn't actually find people willing to go along with it, maybe she didn't fully consent to the possibility. On the other hand, the author believed he was honoring their agreement by making it happen.\n\nAnother angle is the ethical implications of the arrangement. The author is planning to have children with other women, which could be seen as infidelity or a breach of trust in the marriage. Even if it's agreed upon, the emotional impact on the wife could be significant. She might feel used or that her boundaries are being violated. The fact that she's appalled suggests that she didn't foresee the reality of the situation.\n\nAdditionally, the author's motivation to pass on his genes and his status as an only child plays a role. However, that doesn't necessarily override his wife's feelings and expectations. The key issue here is whether both parties fully understood and accepted the terms of the agreement. If the wife thought it was a hypothetical or a temporary solution, then the author might be in the wrong by taking it seriously. Conversely, if the agreement was clear and mutual, then the wife is reneging on her part.\n\nIt's also important to note that five years is a long time, and people's feelings can change. However, the author might argue that the agreement was meant to be binding. The problem is that such a significant decision as having children through another woman is not trivial and might require ongoing consent and communication. The wife's reaction indicates that she didn't anticipate the real-life implications, which might mean the author didn't consider her emotional state or the long-term effects of the agreement.\n\nIn summary, while the author might feel he's honoring the agreement, the wife's current reaction shows that she didn't foresee the actual consequences. This could mean that the agreement wasn't fully understood or consensual in the long term. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing that her initial agreement was based on unrealistic expectations or a different understanding of the situation.\n"
