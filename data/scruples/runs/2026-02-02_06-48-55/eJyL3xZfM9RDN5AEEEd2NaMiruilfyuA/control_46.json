My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the couple met when the author was in med school. They agreed that having children would wait until he was established in his career with a 9-5 job. The wife, a bank teller, was okay with this plan. After they married, the wife later confessed she didn't want children and they discussed divorce. Instead, they made an agreement: after five years when the author becomes a doctor, he would ask friends to have his child. The author would provide child support and possibly visit as an uncle, not a father. Now, five years later, the author has two friends willing to go along with this. But the wife is upset and wants a divorce now.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial agreement, the wife's change of heart, and the new agreement made five years ago. The wife is now backing out of that agreement. The author is upset because he thought they had a deal, but she's changing her mind again.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, a private agreement between spouses isn't binding unless formalized, but that's probably not the main point here. Ethically, the question is about mutual consent and whether the agreement was valid. The wife initially agreed, but now she's rejecting the outcome. The author is following through with the plan they had agreed upon, but the wife's current refusal is causing conflict.\n\nPossible angles: The author didn't force the wife to stay in the marriage against her wishes regarding children. They had a mutual agreement to resolve the issue of differing desires for children. However, the author's plan involves creating children through third parties, which the wife finds unacceptable now. The wife might feel that the original agreement was made under different circumstances or that she misunderstood the implications. The author might argue that he honored the agreement by not seeking other partners and providing support as discussed.\n\nBut maybe the core issue is whether the agreement was fair or realistic. The wife agreed to a non-traditional arrangement, but now she's not okay with the reality. It's possible that the author isn't at fault for following through, but the wife's change of heart is causing the conflict. Alternatively, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the emotional impact on the wife when the plan actually comes to fruition.\n\nAnother angle is the initial agreement's validity. Did they both fully understand the consequences? The wife might have thought the agreement was a temporary solution, not expecting the author to actually find willing partners. The author might have thought he was respecting her wishes by not having children with her but using third parties. However, the wife's reaction suggests she didn't anticipate the emotional strain of the author's children with others on their marriage.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a gray area. The author is following through on a mutually agreed plan, so he isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the wife's current feelings and the complexity of the situation might mean the author didn't consider the emotional aspects enough. But legally and ethically, if they both agreed to the terms, the author is acting within the bounds of that agreement. The problem arises because the wife is now retracting her consent after the plan is feasible. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong for expecting her to honor the agreement they made.\n"
