My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author and his wife made a deal five years ago where he would have children with other people once he became a doctor, and she agreed. Now, when he's ready and found friends who agreed, she's upset and wants to break the agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author wanted children, his wife didn't. They had a compromise where he would have kids with others, and she wouldn't be a mother. The key here is whether their agreement was legally binding or just a verbal understanding. Since it's a personal relationship, it's likely just an agreement they both verbally made. But agreements can change, especially in relationships, especially over time. Five years ago, they both agreed, but now circumstances or feelings might have shifted.\n\nThe wife's reaction is important. She's appalled that the author found people willing to go along with the plan. She might feel betrayed or that the plan was unrealistic. Maybe she didn't fully commit to the agreement because she thought it was a long shot, or perhaps she changed her mind about the arrangement. The author's expectation that she still honors the deal could be based on his belief in keeping promises, but people's perspectives can evolve, especially in personal matters.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust and communication are crucial. Even if a deal was made, if the wife now feels uncomfortable, the author should consider her current feelings. The arrangement might have been a temporary solution back then, but now she's voicing her concerns again. The author's shock at her reaction might stem from not anticipating that she would have lingering reservations. \n\nAlso, the ethical aspect: the author is willing to have children with others while staying married to his wife. This raises questions about the nature of their marriage and the ethics of such an arrangement. Even if they agreed, it's a non-traditional setup that might not align with societal norms or legal standards in some places. The wife's change of heart could be influenced by realizing the potential complications or emotional toll of such an agreement.\n\nAnother angle is the author's motivation. He values passing on his genes, being an only child. His wife's desire not to be a mother was known from the start. The compromise was to have children with others. But when push comes to shove, the wife's consent might not have been fully informed or lasting. People can misjudge their own feelings over time, and what they agree to in a moment of crisis might not hold up later.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have a role. The author made a promise, but the wife is entitled to reassess her stance. Relationships require ongoing communication and mutual respect for each other's evolving needs. The author's insistence on following the five-year-old agreement might overlook the wife's current well-being and happiness. If she's truly against it now, pushing forward could lead to more harm, like the potential divorce.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because he's holding the wife to an agreement that she's now reconsidered, possibly without fully understanding her current feelings or the ethical implications of the arrangement. The key is whether the agreement was a binding one or if both parties have the right to change their minds as circumstances change.\n"
