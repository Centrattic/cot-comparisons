My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The situation involves a couple who made an agreement five years ago about having children. The husband is a doctor, and the wife didn't want kids. They agreed that in five years, he would ask his friends if they wanted to have his child, and he wouldn't be the father but could visit. Now, two friends have agreed, but the wife is upset and wants a divorce because she didn't expect the friends to agree. The author is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The original agreement was five years ago. The wife thought the husband would change his mind about children, but he didn't. They made a deal where he would impregnate others, not have a father role, but be like an uncle. Now, the wife is breaking the agreement because the friends actually agreed. \n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The wife is going back on the deal after they made it. The husband followed through as per the agreement. But the wife is now upset because she didn't expect the friends to agree. \n\nBut wait, the wife's solution was for the husband to impregnate others. She agreed to that deal. Now, she's changing her mind because the deal actually worked out. That seems like she's contradicting the agreement they made. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the deal was unethical or that the wife didn't really mean it. But in terms of the agreement itself, if both parties agreed to the terms, then the husband is following through. The wife is now breaking the agreement, which could mean she's in the wrong. But the situation is complex. The husband's desire for children versus the wife's not wanting them. The wife's solution was unconventional, and now she's upset when it's implemented. \n\nIn terms of moral or legal wrong, it's about the agreement. If they both agreed, then the husband isn't in the wrong. The wife is the one breaking the agreement. However, some might say that such an agreement isn't binding, especially in real life, and that the wife has the right to change her mind. But in the context of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the agreement. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he followed the agreement they made. The wife is the one breaking it now. But I need to check if there's any aspect I'm missing. For example, maybe the agreement was coerced or not fully understood. The wife might have thought it was a hypothetical solution, not to be taken seriously. But according to the story, they worked out the details at the time, so it seems like a real agreement. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
