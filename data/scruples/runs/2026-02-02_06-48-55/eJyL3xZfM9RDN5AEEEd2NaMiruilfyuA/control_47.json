My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a couple who made an agreement five years ago about having children.\n\nFirst, looking at the context: The husband is a doctor, very dedicated to his career. They agreed that when he's done with school and residency (i.e., has a stable job), they would have children. The wife, however, doesn't want to be a mother and suggested an alternative plan. They made a deal where she would allow him to have children with other people through friends, with specific conditions like financial support and possibly visiting the child.\n\nNow, five years later, the husband has two friends who agreed to this arrangement. The wife is upset and appalled, going against the original agreement. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider a few points. First, was the original agreement valid and mutual? They both agreed to the terms at the time. The wife didn't express her discomfort until after the agreement was made. The husband followed through as per their plan, and the wife's reaction now seems to contradict the agreement. However, there's a potential issue of consent and changing circumstances. The wife might have had a change of heart or realized the implications after the fact.\n\nAnother angle is the ethical aspect. The husband is entering into a non-traditional family arrangement, which might be legally and emotionally complex. The wife's role in this is significant since she's part of the agreement. But she's now objecting, which could indicate that the original agreement might not have been fully thought through or that there's a misunderstanding about the terms.\n\nAdditionally, the husband's motivation to pass on his genes and having an only child background might influence his perspective. However, the wife's stance on not wanting to be a mother is also a valid personal choice. The conflict arises when the plan to circumvent that choice by involving third parties is now being rejected by the wife.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the wife's initial suggestion. She proposed this arrangement knowing her own feelings about motherhood. If she agreed to it then, her objection now could be seen as a breach of their agreement. However, human emotions and feelings can evolve, so maybe the wife's stance has changed, which complicates things.\n\nLegally, such agreements might not be enforceable, but in the context of their relationship, the question is more about moral or ethical wrong. The husband is acting on the terms they set, but the wife's current objection introduces a conflict. The husband might not be in the wrong if they had a mutual agreement. However, the wife's reaction might stem from realizing the implications of the agreement or a change in her feelings over time.\n\nAnother point is the nature of the agreement itself. It's unconventional and might not consider the emotional impact on both parties. The wife might have underestimated the emotional toll of her partner having children with others, leading to her current distress. The husband, in following through, might be prioritizing his own desires without considering how the situation affects his wife's feelings now.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are based on a prior agreement, so from that standpoint, he's not in the wrong. However, the wife's change of heart raises questions about the stability of their agreement and mutual understanding. The husband might not be wrong, but the situation highlights the complexities and potential pitfalls of such arrangements.\n"
