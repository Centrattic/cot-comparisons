My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is pretty complex. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author and his wife had a deal five years ago. The deal was about having children once he's a full-time doctor. But the wife didn't want kids, so they made an agreement where he would father children with other people (his friends) while she would be the one to raise them. The author wanted to have biological children, and since he couldn't have them with his wife, he proposed this alternative. Now, after five years, the author has found friends willing to participate, but the wife is upset and breaking the agreement.\n\nSo, the main question is: Did the author and his wife make a valid agreement, and is the wife now wrong to change her mind? Or is the author wrong for expecting her to stick to a five-year-old agreement?\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the nature of the agreement. They were in a committed relationship, married, and made a mutual decision. But the wife's objection to the implementation of the agreement might come from different values or feelings she has now. Maybe she didn't realize the implications back then, or perhaps she changed her mind about being involved in such a setup.\n\nAlso, legal aspects? In most places, such an agreement wouldn't be legally binding, but that's not the main issue here. The question is about moral or ethical wrongdoing. The author is frustrated because he believed they had a deal, and now the wife is going back on it. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that the situation is too extreme or that she didn't fully understand the consequences at the time.\n\nAnother angle: the wife might feel that the author's desire for children is so strong that he's willing to compromise the marriage's integrity. The author, in turn, might think that the wife is being selfish by not honoring their agreement. But is it fair to expect someone to stick to a five-year-old agreement that involves such a significant life decision as parenthood?\n\nAlso, the author is now in a position where he's expecting his wife to be the mother figure to other people's children, which could be emotionally complex for her. Maybe she didn't anticipate the emotional toll of raising a child with a different father, even if it's agreed upon. Or perhaps she's concerned about the societal implications or the child's well-being.\n\nThere's also the aspect of trust. If the author followed through with the plan, the wife might feel betrayed, even if they agreed initially. The initial agreement might have been made in a different context, with different emotions or understanding. People's feelings and values can change over time, especially regarding such a major life decision like having children.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's possible that the agreement they made was not fully thought through or was made under emotional duress. If the wife now feels that the agreement was not valid because of the circumstances or because she didn't fully understand, then the author's expectation might be unreasonable. However, if the agreement was mutual and clear at the time, the author might feel justified in expecting her to follow through.\n\nI need to consider the perspectives of both parties. The author wants to fulfill his desire for children and has a plan in place. The wife, however, is now uncomfortable with the plan's execution. The key issue here is whether the agreement they made was a binding one, both ethically and practically. Since it's a personal relationship, the answer might depend on the moral framework one applies. If the wife changed her mind for valid reasons, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her current feelings. On the other hand, if the agreement was clear and the wife is going back on it without good reason, the author might have a point.\n\nBut I think the main issue is that the agreement they made was based on a mutual understanding at the time, but circumstances and emotions can evolve. Five years is a long time, and people grow and change. The wife's current feelings might be more valid now. Also, the idea of the author fathering children with other women while married to his wife is a complex situation that could lead to ethical and emotional complications. The wife might feel that the original agreement was not realistic or sustainable.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the author is in the wrong because he expected the wife to stick to an agreement that might not have been fully considered or that she later found problematic. It's important to recognize that personal relationships involve ongoing communication and mutual respect for each other's changing circumstances and feelings.\n"
