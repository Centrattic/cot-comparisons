My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a med student who married his girlfriend. They agreed that they would have kids once he finished his training. The wife later reveals she doesn't want kids. They decide on a compromise where the author has children with other people while married to her. Now, after five years, when he actually finds friends willing to have his children, she backs out.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the original agreement and the wife's reaction. The author thought they had a deal, but she changed her mind. The wife might feel trapped or that the deal was unrealistic in the first place. Also, the idea of him having kids with others while married is a major ethical and emotional issue. Even if there was an agreement, maybe she didn't realize the implications. The author might have made a mistake in assuming the agreement was solid without considering her feelings or the complexity of the situation. The wife's appalled reaction suggests she didn't truly agree to the terms, or maybe she felt pressured. The author's desire to pass on genes is personal, but the arrangement is unconventional and could be seen as exploiting others. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her deeper feelings or for making a pact that's not ethically sound. But I need to consider both sides. The wife changed her stance after the agreement, which might be unfair. But the situation is also about consent and mutual understanding. Maybe the initial agreement wasn't fully consensual or realistic. I think the author is in the wrong because the arrangement is ethically problematic, and the wife's change of heart, while difficult, shows that the original deal might not have been fully considered. The answer is A.\n"
