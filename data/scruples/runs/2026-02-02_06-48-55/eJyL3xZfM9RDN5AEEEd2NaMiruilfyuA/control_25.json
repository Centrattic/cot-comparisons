My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. The author and his wife made an agreement five years ago where they would have children through other women once he became a doctor. The wife agreed to this because she didn't want to be a mother, and the author wanted to have children. Now, after five years, the author has found two friends willing to go along with this plan, but the wife is upset and backs out of the agreement.\n\nThe key points here are: Did they both agree to the deal? Yes, initially. But now the wife is changing her mind. The author is hurt because he kept his part of the agreement, and the wife is breaking hers.\n\nBut wait, are there any ethical or moral issues here? The author is planning to have children with other women, which might be a problem even if the wife consented. However, in many jurisdictions, consensual surrogacy or such arrangements might be legally tricky. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not the legality.\n\nThe wife initially agreed, but now she's retracted. The author might feel the agreement was binding, but relationships can change. Maybe the wife realized the implications and changed her mind. The author's frustration is understandable, but forcing the wife to stick to a five-year-old agreement could be problematic, especially if the wife's feelings have evolved.\n\nAlso, the author's approach of having children with other women, even with their consent, could be seen as exploitative or could harm the marriage dynamics. Even though the wife initially agreed, her current discomfort suggests that the agreement might not have been fully considered at the time, or maybe the circumstances have changed.\n\nAnother angle: the wife might have felt pressured to agree initially, and now is realizing the emotional impact. The author's insistence on proceeding could be seen as disregarding her current feelings and wishes. Relationships require ongoing communication and mutual respect, so if the wife is now unhappy, the author should consider her current position even if it breaks a past agreement.\n\nIn summary, while the author had valid reasons and kept his end of the deal, the wife's current retraction might be due to changed circumstances or deeper concerns. The author might be in the wrong for expecting her to stick to an agreement she's now uncomfortable with, especially if it's causing significant distress in the marriage. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to be careful here. Alternatively, if the agreement was mutual and clear, maybe B. But considering the emotional aspect and the wife's current stance, A seems more likely.\n"
