My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. The author and his wife had an agreement five years ago where they would put off having children until he became a full-time doctor. The wife didn't want kids, but the author did. They made a deal that he would have children with other people, and she would handle the marriage. Now, when he's ready to fulfill the deal, she's backing out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. They made a mutual decision when they were both in love and committed. The wife agreed to the deal because she didn't want to be a mother. The author thought they both understood and accepted this arrangement. But now, the wife is saying she never expected the deal to actually go through. That's a problem because agreements require mutual consent and understanding. If the wife's expectations were different, maybe she didn't truly agree at the time, or maybe there was a misunderstanding.\n\nAnother angle is the wife's current reaction. She's appalled that the author's friends agreed. Maybe she didn't realize how serious he was about this arrangement. Or perhaps she thought that the deal was a hypothetical or a way to keep the marriage going without pressure. The author's argument is that they had a clear agreement, so he's justified in moving forward. But the wife feels betrayed, thinking that the deal wasn't real.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. Having children with other people while in a marriage is unconventional and could be seen as infidelity, even if there's an agreement. However, the key here is the consent and the terms they both agreed upon. If both parties were in agreement five years ago, then the author might not be in the wrong for following through. But the wife's current objection suggests that maybe there was a lack of true understanding or that her feelings have changed over time.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is about wanting to have children and pass on his genes. The wife, on the other hand, values the marriage and doesn't want to be a mother. The author is trying to satisfy his desire without ending the marriage, but the wife isn't comfortable with the reality of the deal now. It's possible that the wife didn't anticipate the emotional impact of the situation or the social implications when the time came to act on the agreement.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the agreement was clear and both understood the terms, then the author isn't in the wrong for following through. However, if the wife's consent was based on unrealistic expectations or if there was a miscommunication, then the author might have a responsibility to reconsider. But since they both agreed at the time, and the wife hasn't mentioned any coercion, the author's actions are within the bounds of their agreement.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the wife's trust and emotional well-being. Even if the agreement was made, the reality of her husband having children with others might be more than she can handle. The fact that she's now appalled suggests that maybe the deal wasn't as consensual or realistic as they both thought. The author might have underestimated her feelings about the situation when it's time to execute the plan.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the clarity of their original agreement. If they both understood and accepted the terms fully, then he's not necessarily in the wrong. If there was a misunderstanding or if the wife's consent was based on false premises, then he might share some responsibility. But based on the information given, the author acted on a mutual agreement, so the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there are valid points on both sides.\n"
