My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple who made an agreement five years ago about having children. The husband is a doctor, and they agreed when he's established, he would have children with other women through his friends, while the wife would handle the mothering. Now, after five years, the wife is against the plan when the husband actually has friends willing to do this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The original agreement was made when they were in a different stage of their relationship. The wife had always wanted the husband to change his mind about children, but they compromised with this arrangement. The husband followed through, found two friends who agreed, and then the wife is upset now.\n\nSo the main issue is whether the wife is now breaking the agreement. The husband feels betrayed because they had the deal. But the wife argues that she didn't expect any of his friends to agree and that she never really thought he would go through with it. Now she's reconsidering her stance, which conflicts with the agreement.\n\nI should consider consent and mutual agreement. Both parties agreed to the terms at the time. The wife's current reaction might be due to a change of heart or a realization of the implications that weren't apparent before. However, agreements, even verbal, can be binding in a relationship. The husband fulfilled his part by finding willing partners, and the wife is now going against the plan.\n\nAnother angle is the nature of the agreement. It's a unique situation where the wife is allowing her husband to have children with other women while maintaining the marriage. This is unconventional and might not be something that can be easily upheld if emotions or circumstances change. The wife might feel pressured into the agreement initially, or perhaps she didn't fully grasp the reality of the situation.\n\nAlso, the husband's motivation is about passing on his genes and the importance of children. The wife, on the other hand, never wanted to be a mother and perhaps the compromise was a way to keep the marriage alive without having children. Now, when the plan is actually feasible, she's reconsidering. Maybe she feels the emotional toll would be too much, or she's realized the plan isn't viable.\n\nThe husband's actions might be seen as going against the spirit of the agreement if the wife didn't truly mean it. But if they both agreed and the husband acted on it, then the wife's current stance could be breaking trust. However, if the agreement was based on mutual understanding and she's now changing her mind, that's a conflict in communication.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author (husband) might not be in the wrong because they had an agreement. But the wife's change of heart complicates things. It's possible that the agreement wasn't fully thought through, especially considering the emotional and social complexities. So, while the husband followed through, the wife's current position might be difficult to uphold, but it's also her right to change her mind if the original agreement wasn't fully binding.\n\nBut in terms of fairness, if they both had a mutual agreement, and he acted on it, then the wife is going back on her word, which could make her at fault. However, if the agreement was based on her initial reluctance to get a divorce and she didn't truly consent, then the husband might be at fault for not recognizing her true feelings. It's a bit of a gray area. The key is whether the agreement was genuine and if both parties understood the implications. The wife might have agreed under the assumption that he wouldn't find anyone, but when he did, she's unhappy. That's a problem with the agreement's terms and expectations not being fully aligned.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are based on a prior agreement, so he might not be in the wrong. However, the wife's current stance could be seen as breaking that agreement. But considering the nature of the agreement and potential misunderstandings, it's a complex situation where both parties might have valid points. However, since the user is asking specifically if the author is in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether the agreement was valid and if the wife's change of heart is justified. Given that they made the agreement and he followed through, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
