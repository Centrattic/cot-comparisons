My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The story is about a couple who made a five-year-old agreement where the husband would have children with other women while married to his wife, who doesn't want kids. Now, when the husband is ready to follow through, the wife is against it, leading to a potential divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. Both parties agreed to this plan years ago when discussing having children. The wife was aware of the terms and agreed. But now, she's changing her stance. But wait, maybe the problem here is that the agreement was based on a misunderstanding or unrealistic expectations. The wife might have thought the plan was hypothetical or not something the husband would actually pursue. However, the husband took it seriously and found willing friends. \n\nAnother angle is the ethical and emotional aspects. Even if there was an agreement, can someone truly consent to such a scenario? The wife's reaction suggests she didn't anticipate the actual proposal happening. Maybe she didn't realize the husband was serious, or perhaps the agreement was made under pressure or in a different emotional state. \n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning is that he wants to have children, and he's willing to have a relationship with the child as an uncle, not a father. However, this raises questions about the children's well-being and the legal/ethical implications of such an arrangement. The wife might feel that this complicates their marriage and could lead to emotional issues down the line.\n\nThe key points here are consent, mutual understanding at the time of the agreement, and the feasibility of the plan. If the wife genuinely agreed to the terms at the time, then the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. But if there was a miscommunication or if the wife's consent was not fully informed, then the husband might be overstepping. \n\nAdditionally, societal norms and the potential for future regret are factors. Even if both parties agreed initially, the wife's current objection might be valid because the situation is more concrete now. The husband's actions could be seen as pressuring her into a lifelong commitment that she's now reconsidering. \n\nIn terms of the law, such an agreement isn't legally enforceable, and the wife has the right to change her mind. The husband's insistence on proceeding despite her current objections might be the real issue here. The initial agreement is in the past, and people's feelings can evolve. The wife's current stance is her right, and the husband should respect that, even if it's a difficult decision.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the husband might be in the wrong because he's pushing forward with an arrangement that the wife is now against. The core of the problem is that while there was an agreement, it's possible that the wife's expectations were different, and her current refusal needs to be respected.\n"
