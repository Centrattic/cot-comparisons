My wife and I met while I was just starting med school, and we fell in love and everything was great. I am very dedicated to my career, so early on the topic of children was always \"in the future, when I'm done with school and residency, so I will have a 9-5 job that pays well and supports a family.\" At that time, my wife (who was at the time just my girlfriend) agreed.\n\n\n\nThe summer before my final year of med school, we got married, and when we talked about future children, the plan was still \"in the future\" when I have a 9-5 job. My wife is a bank teller, so her hours were always good but I want to be around for my children, so we agreed to stick with the plan.\n\n\n\nA few years later, my wife confessed to me that she had always hoped that I would change my mind about children, and that she does not want to be a mother. I was shocked and heartbroken, and I told her that we should probably file for divorce, as I believe children are important and I want to pass on my genes and keep my family line alive. (I am an only child). My wife said we could avoid getting a divorce. Our relationship is otherwise fantastic, and I love her more than anyone. \n\n\nSo here is my wife's solution: I should ask my friends if I could have sex with them so they could have my child. At first I was resistant because I thought divorce was where I wanted to go, but when I reflected on the topic, I realized that I loved my wife, and I was unsure if I could love another woman as much as I love her. So, we made an agreement. In 5 years, when I was a full physician, I would ask my friends if they would agree to our situation. My wife and I worked out the details at that time. I would offer child support (because money is not a problem for us. I was blessed that between scholarship and my family's funds, I did not have to take out loans for my education), and I would not be a father to the child; however, if the mother would allow it, I could visit and be like an uncle.\n\n\n\nSo that was 5 years ago. I have the job I want, and I have two friends who said yes. One is my two good friends who med school. They are married, but the husband is sterile, so they were planning on finding a sperm donor, but they prefer me, and said yes. The second is a friend from my residency class. She is currently single and has no plans on ever getting married. Again, she was planning on finding a sperm donor, but when I offered, she said yes.\n\n\n\nWhen I told my wife the good news, she was appalled. She said she never expected any of my friends to agree to this sort of deal. Now, I am upset, and divorce is back on the table because she is going against the agreement we made 5 years ago. She states that it is ridiculous that I would think she actually would accept that I father children to other people. She says she hoped that none of my friends would accept and that I would have given up.\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author and his wife made a deal five years ago where they agreed that the author would eventually have children through other women, not his wife. The wife didn't want to be a mother, and the author wanted to have children. So they came to this agreement where he would use his friends as sperm donors, with the possibility of him being involved as an uncle but not a father. Now, the author has found two friends who agreed to this, but his wife is upset and wants to break the agreement, leading to possible divorce.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of the agreement. The author and his wife both consented to the plan when they were married. So, in theory, both agreed to the terms. However, agreements made under emotional stress or with incomplete understanding might be questionable. The wife now says she didn't think any of his friends would agree, which was her hope. That might suggest that her consent wasn't fully informed, or maybe she had hidden expectations.\n\nAnother angle is the nature of the agreement. Using friends as sperm donors raises issues of exploitation, consent, and the long-term implications for the children. Even if both parties agreed, the third parties (the friends) might have different considerations. The author mentions that one friend is married with a sterile husband, and the other is single. The ethical implications here could be significant, especially regarding the relationships with these friends and the potential impact on the children.\n\nAlso, the fact that the wife is now backing out after five years might be based on a change of heart or a realization she didn't foresee. However, agreements made in a marriage, especially life-changing ones, require mutual commitment. If she agreed at the time, but now is going back on it, that could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nBut the author's part in all this is key. Did he have the right to proceed with the plan he set out, given that his wife is now objecting? Even if they had an agreement, if the situation has changed or new information has come up, that might affect the validity of the agreement. However, if the agreement was clear and both parties knew the terms, the wife's objection might be seen as a breach.\n\nI also need to consider consent and the nature of marriage. Marriage involves mutual respect and ongoing consent. If the wife feels pressured or if the agreement was made under emotional distress (like the threat of divorce), then her consent might not have been voluntary. On the other hand, if the agreement was mutual and clear, and the author is following through as agreed, then he might not be in the wrong.\n\nAnother point is the children's well-being. The author plans to be an uncle but not a father, which could lead to complex family dynamics. The friends' consent might be given without fully understanding the long-term implications, or maybe they didn't realize the author's intentions. The wife's current concerns might be about the ethical implications of this arrangement.\n\nIn summary, the key issues are consent, the nature of the agreement, the ethical implications of using friends as sperm donors, and the change in the wife's stance. If the agreement was properly consensual and both parties understood the terms, the author might not be in the wrong. However, if the agreement was ethically problematic or based on incomplete information, then the author could be in the wrong for proceeding without considering the broader consequences.\n"
