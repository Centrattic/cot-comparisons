I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for raising her kid vegan and the situation with her boyfriend's mom. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is a 23-year-old single mom who has been vegan for ten years. She decided to raise her daughter vegan, which she's been doing with the help of her doctor to ensure the child is healthy. That part seems responsible. She's consulting a doctor regularly, so the health aspect is covered. So, from a health standpoint, she's not neglecting her child's needs.\n\nNow, the issue arises when they went to her boyfriend's mom's house for a family dinner. The author brought vegan desserts to share, and there was a mix-up where the mom served non-vegan desserts to the author's daughter. The author confronted the mom, who responded dismissively, even implying the author isn't feeding the child properly. The author then wants to address this with the mom again to express how upsetting it was.\n\nThe main points to consider here: Is it wrong to raise a child vegan? Well, as long as the diet is nutritionally adequate, which the author checks with a doctor, it's generally acceptable. The American Academy of Pediatrics and other health organizations state that with proper planning, vegan diets can be safe for children. So, the author isn't wrong in that aspect.\n\nThe other part is the interaction with the boyfriend's mom. The mom took it upon herself to serve non-vegan food to the author's daughter without consulting the author. That's where the conflict comes in. The author had communicated she would bring her own food, yet the mom didn't respect that, possibly undermining the author's parenting choices. The mom's comment about \"real food\" and \"meat on her bones\" is not only dismissive but also invalidates the author's dietary choices. The author's reaction is understandable; she wants to protect her child's diet and their values.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to address this with the mom again? Probably not. The mom's actions were disrespectful and crossed a boundary. The author isn't wrong for standing up for her choices and her daughter's well-being. The key here is that the mom overstepped, and the author is within her rights to express her feelings about it.\n\nSo putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong for either raising her child vegan (as it's medically supervised) or for addressing the mom's actions. The boyfriend's mom is the one acting disrespectfully here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
