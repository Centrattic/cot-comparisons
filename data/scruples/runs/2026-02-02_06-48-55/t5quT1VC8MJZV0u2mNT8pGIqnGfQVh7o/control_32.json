I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a woman who raised her daughter vegan, and her boyfriend's mom gave her daughter a non-vegan dessert without asking. The author is upset about it and considering confronting the mother-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the facts. The author has been vegan for 10 years and raised her daughter that way, consulting with doctors to ensure her health. She prepared vegan desserts and brought them to the Christmas dinner. She asked the mother-in-law if she wanted her to bring her own food, which the mother-in-law allowed except for the vegetables. The daughter initially started with the other kids but ended up eating the non-vegan dessert. The mother-in-law made a comment about \"real food\" and meat on her bones, which upset the author.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the rights and wrongs. The author is a single mom making a choice for her child's diet, which she's been doing for years with medical guidance. The mother-in-law, without consulting the author, gave the child non-vegan food, possibly against the author's wishes. The author's main issue is feeling disrespected and undermining her parenting choice.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the mother-in-law didn't do anything illegal. However, the ethical question is about respecting the child's dietary needs as chosen by the parent. The author had communicated her preferences in advance and prepared her own food. The mother-in-law's actions could be seen as disregarding the author's parenting decisions and possibly putting the child's health or values at risk, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe mother-in-law's comment about \"real food\" and meat on her bones is dismissive and could be seen as undermining the author's choice. The daughter was also upset about eating animal products, which the author had already discussed with her in an age-appropriate way. The mother-in-law's shushing the daughter adds to the disrespect.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is not in the wrong. She had a right to make decisions about her child's diet and communicate her preferences. The mother-in-law, on the other hand, crossed a line by acting against those preferences without discussion, leading to the daughter's distress. The author's anger is justified given the situation, and she has the right to address this with her boyfriend's mom to prevent future occurrences.\n"
