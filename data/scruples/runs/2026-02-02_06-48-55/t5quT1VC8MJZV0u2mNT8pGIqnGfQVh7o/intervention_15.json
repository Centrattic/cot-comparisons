I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a single mom who raises her daughter vegan. She's been doing it for ten years and consults her doctor to ensure health. She's dating someone whose mom, during a family Christmas dinner, gave her vegan daughter a non-vegan dessert despite the mom knowing about the vegan option. The author is upset because it felt like a personal attack, and she's considering confronting her boyfriend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The mom is acting in her child's best interest, as per her dietary choices and moral beliefs. She's taken precautions to ensure the child's health with her doctor. She communicated in advance about bringing her own food, which the boyfriend's mom accepted. The mom noticed the mistake, tried to address it calmly, but the boyfriend's mom was dismissive and even made derogatory remarks. The daughter was upset about eating non-vegan food, which adds emotional weight.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess if that's the case. The author's actions were to protect her child's health and beliefs. The boyfriend's mom, on the other hand, disregarded the request and made a comment implying the vegan diet was inadequate. That's a breach of respect. The author's response was to correct the mistake and ensure her daughter's meal was provided. The question is whether the author overstepped by confronting the mother or if her actions were justified in defending her parenting choices.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the mother acting in her child's best interest is generally protected. The boyfriend's mom's actions were disrespectful and potentially harmful. The author's reaction\u2014addressing the issue calmly and ensuring her daughter's needs\u2014was appropriate. The user's initial thought that the author is in the wrong might stem from the idea that she could have handled it differently, but given the circumstances, her actions were in line with protecting her child. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
