I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mom who's raising her daughter vegan. She's been vegan for ten years and made sure her daughter follows that diet, with medical check-ups to ensure health. She's in a relationship with a guy who's not vegan but respects her choice. They went to his mom's house for a big family dinner on Boxing Day. The mom had prepared vegan desserts for the kids, including her daughter. However, when serving dessert, her daughter ended up eating a non-vegan dessert. The author confronted the boyfriend's mom, who responded dismissively, even implying that the vegan diet isn't proper for a child. The author is now considering confronting her again about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that she's making an ethical choice for her child, which she's discussed with a doctor. She made sure to bring her own food, communicated in advance, and assumed the host would respect that. When it didn't happen, she felt disrespected and was upset for her daughter. The boyfriend's mom, on the other hand, might have thought that it's a special occasion and that a vegan dessert isn't necessary, perhaps thinking that the child should experience \"real food.\" She might also have a bias against the vegan diet, which could stem from her own beliefs or lack of understanding.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's following her own values and medical advice, so that's on her side. She communicated her needs, so the onus was on the host to accommodate. The mother-in-law might have failed to respect that communication. However, the author could have been more proactive in ensuring the dessert was served correctly. Maybe she should have stayed with the kids during dessert to prevent the mix-up, but she was probably busy with the rest of the event. Also, the mother-in-law's reaction was dismissive and disrespectful, which could be the main issue here. \n\nThe author's intention was to protect her child's diet, which she has the right to do as a parent. The mother-in-law overstepped by commenting on her parenting choices in front of the child. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling upset and considering addressing the issue. Since the mother-in-law didn't respect the prior communication and the child's dietary needs, the author isn't in the wrong. The key here is the failure of the host to honor the request, not the parent's stance on veganism. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
