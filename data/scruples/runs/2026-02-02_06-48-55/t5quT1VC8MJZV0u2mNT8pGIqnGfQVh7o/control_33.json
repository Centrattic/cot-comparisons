I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a 23-year-old single mom raising her five-year-old daughter vegan. She's been vegan for ten years and made the choice to raise her daughter that way, consulting her doctor to ensure the diet is healthy. She's dating a non-vegan guy who's respectful and eats vegan at her house. They went to his mom's house for a family dinner on Boxing Day. The author asked in advance if she could bring her own food, which the mom agreed to except for the veggies, so she brought vegan desserts for everyone. The mother served other desserts to the kids, including the author's daughter, without serving the vegan ones. The author confronted the mother, who responded defensively, saying things like \"real food\" and \"meat on her bones,\" and the daughter found out she was given non-vegan food. The author is now upset and wondering if she should confront the mother again.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about raising a child vegan and the interaction with the boyfriend's mom. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Raising a Child Vegan**: The author is following a vegan diet and has chosen this for her daughter. It's important to note that in many places, as long as the child is getting proper nutrition, parents have the right to choose a vegetarian or vegan diet for their children. The author mentions consulting her doctor regularly to ensure the child is healthy, which is a responsible step. So, legally and morally, she's not necessarily in the wrong here. However, some might argue that a vegan diet for young children could be challenging, but the author is taking care to ensure it's nutritionally adequate.\n\n2. **Interaction with the Boyfriend's Mom**: The mom served non-vegan food to the author's daughter without permission. The author had brought vegan desserts specifically for her daughter. The mother's response was dismissive and condescending, implying that the vegan diet is inadequate. The author then had to correct the situation, which upset both her and her daughter.\n\n3. **The Author's Actions**: The author asked in advance about bringing her own food, which was mostly accepted. She brought the vegan desserts. When she noticed the substitution, she confronted the mother in a calm manner. The mother's reaction was rude and disrespectful. The author then informed her daughter, explaining the situation in an age-appropriate way. After the event, the author is considering confronting the mother again to express her feelings.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether the author's choice to raise her daughter vegan is valid, and whether her response to the mother's actions is appropriate.\n\nRegarding the vegan diet: As long as it's nutritionally sufficient, parents can choose this for their children. The author is consulting with a doctor, so that's responsible. Therefore, she's not in the wrong for that decision.\n\nRegarding the interaction: The mother acted unilaterally, serving non-vegan food without consent. The author had specific dietary needs for her daughter, especially since the mother had been informed in advance. The mother's actions were disrespectful and undermined the parent's authority. The author's response was to address it calmly and correct the situation, which is reasonable. The mother's defensive and dismissive attitude is problematic.\n\nThe author's consideration to address the issue again is about setting boundaries and ensuring her daughter's needs are respected. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to confront the mother. Since the mother's actions were the initial problem, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address it. The key point is that the mother acted without permission, and the author had a right to be upset about her child's welfare and the respect shown to her parenting.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's mom was disrespectful, and the author is asserting her right to make dietary choices for her child, which is protected as long as it's done responsibly. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
