I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by summarizing the situation. The author is a vegan mother who raised her daughter vegan. She's in a relationship with a non-vegan guy, and they went to his mom's house for a family dinner. The author prepared vegan desserts to bring along so her daughter could eat. The mom of the boyfriend served the other desserts to the kids, including her daughter, even though she had the vegan ones prepared. The author confronted the mother-in-law, who responded dismissively, implying that the vegan diet might not be good for the child and that she should eat \"real food.\" The author is upset because she feels disrespected and her daughter was upset too.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The mother is following a vegan diet for her child with medical clearance. She's prepared and ensured her daughter's health. The mother-in-law, without consulting the mother, gave the child non-vegan dessert, possibly against the mother's wishes. The mother-in-law made comments that undermined the mother's parenting choices. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The mother's actions are based on her dietary choices, which are approved by a doctor. The mother-in-law, on the other hand, acted unilaterally, without consent, and made derogatory remarks. The author's reaction is understandable given the situation\u2014she's protecting her child's health and values. The mother-in-law's actions could be seen as overstepping, as she's not the child's parent and shouldn't make decisions about her diet without consent.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a nuance I'm missing. Could the mother-in-law have had a different intention? The author assumed the mother-in-law was trying to sneak non-vegan food, but maybe it was just a mistake. But the response from the mother-in-law was confrontational, which adds to the tension. The mother's approach was to confront her politely, but the mother-in-law dismissed her concerns. \n\nAlso, the daughter was upset because she knows about the vegan lifestyle, so the mother's concern is not just about diet but also about her child's values. The mother-in-law's comments about \"meat on her bones\" suggest a judgment of the mother's parenting, which is disrespectful.\n\nIn terms of responsibility: The mother-in-law made a unilateral decision without consulting the child's parent, which is a breach of trust. The author is within her rights to be upset and to address the issue. The mother-in-law's actions have created a conflict, and the author's response is a legitimate reaction to being disrespected.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The mother-in-law's actions were the main issue here. The author tried to prepare in advance, communicated her needs, and when they were ignored, she had a right to address it. The question is whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong, and based on the situation, the answer is B (No).\n"
