I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a 23-year-old single mom who's been vegan for ten years. She decided to raise her five-year-old daughter vegan, which she's been doing with medical guidance to ensure her health. Then she started dating a non-vegan guy, and his mom didn't want any vegan desserts cut. The author's daughter ended up eating a non-vegan dessert, which upset her because it involved animal products. The author confronted the mom, who responded dismissively, saying it was Christmas and real food is better, etc. Now the author is considering bringing it up again to explain how it was upsetting.\n\nFirst, the author's decision to raise her child vegan. Legally, parents have the right to choose their child's diet as long as it's nutritionally adequate. Since she's consulting a doctor and ensuring health, that's covered. Ethically, some might question it, but the question is about being in the wrong, not just opinion. The boyfriend's mom's actions: she served non-vegan food to the daughter without the author's consent. The daughter is young, so the author expects her mom to honor the dietary preferences unless there's a medical issue. The mom's comment about meat and not knowing how to feed a child properly is disrespectful and undermines the author's parenting choices.\n\nThe author's reaction: she was angry and later discussed it with her daughter. She wants to address it with the boyfriend's mom. The key points here are consent and respect. The mom didn't ask the author if it's okay to serve non-vegan food to the daughter, even though the author had brought vegan options. The author's dietary choice is a personal one, and the mom's actions could be seen as a breach of trust. The author's intention was to provide the vegan dessert, and the mom's interference without consent is problematic.\n\nPossible counterarguments: maybe the mom didn't realize the impact, or it was a mistake. But the mom's dismissive attitude when confronted shows a lack of respect. Also, the daughter was upset, which could affect her emotional well-being. The author's approach was to inform her daughter about the mistake, which is honest and considers her feelings. Bringing it up again could be to set boundaries, which is reasonable in a family dynamic where the author might not be liked already. However, the author should handle it calmly to avoid conflict, but that doesn't mean she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the mom's actions, as they were disrespectful. Her parenting choice is valid with medical approval. The boyfriend's mom made an assumption and acted against the parent's wishes, which is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
