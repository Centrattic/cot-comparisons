I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author (a 23-year-old single mom raising her daughter vegan) is in the wrong here. The main issue is during a Christmas dinner at her boyfriend's mom's house. The mom brought vegan desserts for her daughter, but the boyfriend's mom served the non-vegan dessert instead, leading to the daughter eating it. The author is upset because she feels her dietary choices were undermined and that her daughter was given non-vegan food without her consent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Raising a child vegan is a personal choice, but parents should ensure the child's nutritional needs are met. The author mentions consulting a doctor, so that's covered. Legally, unless there's a court order or specific medical requirement, parents have the right to choose their child's diet. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making that choice.\n\nNext, the situation at the boyfriend's mom's house. The author brought vegan desserts and made her intentions clear. The boyfriend's mom, however, decided to serve the non-vegan dessert. The key here is whether the mom had the right to override the parent's dietary decision. Since the child is under the author's care, the grandmother doesn't have the authority to make that choice. The grandmother's actions could be seen as overstepping, especially without consulting the parent. Her comments about \"real food\" and \"meat on her bones\" are dismissive and disrespectful, which adds to the tension.\n\nThe author's reaction is understandable. She was trying to protect her child's diet and values, and the grandmother's actions undermined that. The author didn't confront her aggressively but asked calmly later. The daughter was upset about eating non-vegan food, showing that the mother's intentions were to instill certain values, which the grandmother dismissed.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. She had communicated her needs in advance, prepared accordingly, and ensured her daughter's health. The grandmother's actions were disrespectful and possibly harmful to the child's dietary needs. The author's decision to address the issue isn't about being right but about standing up for her parenting choices. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
