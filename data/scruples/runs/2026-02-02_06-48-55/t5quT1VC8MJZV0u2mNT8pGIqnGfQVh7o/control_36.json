I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for raising her daughter vegan and the situation with her boyfriend's mom. \n\nFirst, the author is a single mom who's been vegan for 10 years and chose to raise her daughter vegan. She consults her doctor to ensure her child's health. That part seems responsible. She's making sure the diet is healthy, so from a health standpoint, she's doing what she's supposed to.\n\nThen, they visited the boyfriend's mom for Christmas. The author brought vegan desserts, expecting them to be served. The mom-in-law served non-vegan desserts to the child, leading to the author's frustration. The key points here are that the author communicated her needs in advance, prepared her own food, and the mom-in-law didn't honor that. The mom-in-law's comments about Christmas and real food suggest a lack of respect for the author's parenting choices.\n\nThe author confronts her calmly, explains the mistake to her daughter, and gives her a vegan slice. The mom-in-law doesn't seem to approve of the author, which adds tension. The author is considering addressing this again with the mom-in-law to express being upset.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether it's wrong to raise a child vegan. Since the author is consulting a doctor and ensuring the daughter is healthy, there's no evidence here that the diet is harmful. Thus, the parenting choice isn't inherently wrong. The mom-in-law's actions were disrespectful and potentially disregarded the child's dietary needs. The author's anger is justified given that she made her preferences clear and the mom-in-law acted against her wishes and the child's preferences (the daughter loves animals and was upset).\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No), because she's acting in her child's best interest and the mom-in-law's behavior was the issue. The author isn't doing anything wrong here.\n"
