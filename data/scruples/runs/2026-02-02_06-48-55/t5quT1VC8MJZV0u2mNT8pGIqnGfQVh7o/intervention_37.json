I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old single mom raising her daughter vegan. She's been vegan for 10 years and ensures her daughter's diet is healthy with doctor check-ups. She's dating a non-vegan guy who respects her choice, even eating vegan at her house. They went to his mom's house for Christmas, and the mom tried to feed the daughter non-vegan dessert, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the mom had communicated in advance about bringing her own food and vegan desserts. She even brought extras for others to try. The daughter ended up eating a non-vegan dessert, which upset the mom. The boyfriend's mom dismissed the dietary choice, suggesting it's Christmas and the child should have \"real food.\" The daughter was upset because she loves animals and was told to eat something that harms them.\n\nSo, the question is whether the mom is in the wrong. From a legal and ethical standpoint, parents have the right to make dietary choices for their children, especially if they're consulting with a doctor. The mom took precautions to ensure her child's health. The boyfriend's mom overstepped by giving the child food that went against the parents' wishes and then being dismissive. The mom's reaction seems justified given that she had communicated her needs and the other party ignored them, potentially undermining her parenting. The daughter was also upset, which adds to the mom's concern.\n\nThe key points here are the mom's efforts to ensure her child's diet is healthy and her communication about the dietary needs. The boyfriend's mom didn't respect those wishes and acted unkindly. The mom is defending her parental choice, which is her right. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
