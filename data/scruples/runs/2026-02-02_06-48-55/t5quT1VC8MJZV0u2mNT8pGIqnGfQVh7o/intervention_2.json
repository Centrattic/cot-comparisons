I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (a single mom raising her daughter vegan) is in the wrong in this situation.\n\nFirst, the mom is 23 and has been vegan for 10 years. She chose to raise her daughter vegan as a moral stance, which she's checked with her doctor to ensure it's healthy. That seems responsible. She even prepared her own vegan desserts for the visit to her boyfriend's mom's house. But when it came time for dessert, the boyfriend's mom didn't serve the vegan options, instead giving the child a non-vegan dessert. The mom confronted her, and the mother-in-law was dismissive, implying that the vegan diet isn't proper for a child and that it's Christmas time. The daughter was upset after eating the non-vegan dessert, and the mom now wants to address this with the mother-in-law again.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about my take. I need to decide if the mom is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nSo, the key points here: The mom is following a vegan diet for her child, which is medically approved. She brought her own food to avoid issues. The mother-in-law, despite being respectful, substituted the child's dessert without consulting, which the mom found disrespectful and potentially harmful. \n\nFrom a parenting perspective, the mom is making dietary choices she believes are healthy and ethical. The mother-in-law's actions might be seen as undermining her parenting decisions. However, the mother-in-law's intent could be questioned\u2014was she trying to \"correct\" the child's diet or just being careless? Also, the mom is concerned about the child's health and feelings, which is valid. \n\nBut maybe the mom's reaction is too harsh? She was angry and wants to bring it up again. However, the mother-in-law did cross a line by not following the request and making a comment about meat. The mom had already taken steps to ensure her child's diet was safe, so she has a right to be upset about the substitution. \n\nConsidering all this, the mom isn't in the wrong. Her actions were in good faith, and she had the right to expect her child's dietary needs to be respected. The mother-in-law's behavior was the issue here. So the answer should be B.\n"
