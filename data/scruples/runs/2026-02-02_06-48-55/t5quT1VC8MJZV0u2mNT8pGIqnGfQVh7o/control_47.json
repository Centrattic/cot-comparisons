I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mom raising her daughter vegan, and then her boyfriend's mom gave the kid a non-vegan dessert despite being told about the vegan options. The author is upset and considering confronting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The mom has been vegan for 10 years, is single, and is taking care of her daughter's health with doctor check-ups. That shows she's making an informed choice. She communicated with her boyfriend's mom in advance about bringing vegan food, which she did. The mom's intention was to have her daughter follow a vegan diet, which she believes is healthy and moral. \n\nThe conflict arises when the boyfriend's mom serves non-vegan desserts. The key points here are communication and respect. The mom had already taken the initiative to bring vegan options. The mother-in-law, however, didn't honor that, possibly to sneak meat into the child's diet. The mom is upset because it's a breach of trust and undermines her parenting choices.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the mother's choice to raise her child vegan, after consulting doctors, is her right as a parent. The mother-in-law's actions seem to disregard this decision without consent, which could be seen as overstepping. The mom's reaction is about protecting her daughter's dietary needs and respecting her parenting choices. \n\nHowever, the mom might be in the wrong if her approach to confronting the situation is confrontational. But in this case, she's considering a respectful conversation to address the issue. The main issue isn't about the vegan diet itself but respecting the boundaries set by the parent. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the situation. Her actions were about protecting her child and standing by her parenting choices. The mother-in-law's actions were disrespectful. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
