I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a vegan mom bringing her daughter to her boyfriend's mom's house for Christmas, where the boyfriend's mom served non-vegan dessert to the child without asking, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The mom has been vegan for ten years and is raising her daughter vegan, with a doctor's approval. She brought vegan desserts to share, and when she noticed the daughter eating non-vegan dessert, she confronted the mother-in-law. The mother-in-law responded dismissively, implying that the child should try \"real food\" and even insulted her feeding habits. The daughter was upset because she knows about the vegan values and the harm to animals.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The mom is following her own values and ensuring her child's diet is healthy with medical supervision. She was prepared to provide vegan options, and the mother-in-law acted without consulting her, which could be seen as disrespectful. The daughter's feelings were hurt, which adds emotional impact. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mother-in-law was just trying to feed the child and maybe didn't realize the importance of the vegan diet. But the mom had already communicated her request in advance, bringing her own food, and the mother-in-law ignored that, even going to the extent of sneaking non-vegan food. That seems intentional. \n\nThe author's actions were to address the situation calmly, explain to the daughter, and correct the mistake. They're now considering bringing it up again to the mother-in-law to express their hurt feelings. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the mom is advocating for her child's dietary choices, which are medically approved. The mother-in-law's actions crossed a line by disregarding the prior arrangement and making a comment that undermined the mom's parenting. So the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for her child's needs and her own parenting decisions. The mother-in-law is the one who acted disrespectfully. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
