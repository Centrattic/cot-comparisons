I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The scenario involves a vegan mother who took her daughter to her boyfriend's mom's house for dinner. The mom had brought vegan desserts, but the daughter ended up eating a non-vegan dessert. The mother confronted the boyfriend's mom, who dismissed her concerns. Now the mom is considering confronting her again.\n\nFirst, let's consider the mother's actions. She raised her daughter vegan, which is her choice as a parent. She consulted her doctor to ensure her daughter is healthy, which shows she's responsible. She also prepared her own vegan options for the family, which is logical to avoid dietary issues. The key issue here is that her daughter ended up eating non-vegan food, which the mother found upsetting, especially because her daughter is upset about animal welfare.\n\nThe boyfriend's mom's actions are questionable. She didn't serve the vegan desserts prepared by the mother and instead gave the child non-vegan dessert. Her comments about \"real food\" and \"meat on her bones\" suggest she's undermining the mother's parenting choices. This could be seen as disrespectful, especially since she had been informed beforehand about the dietary needs. The mother's desire to address this with the boyfriend's mom is understandable, given that the actions affected her child and their beliefs.\n\nThe mother isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect her daughter's diet and values. She had taken precautions, and the other party didn't respect that. The boyfriend's mom's behavior was dismissive and possibly harmful to the child's understanding of her dietary choices. The mother's reaction is a response to being disrespected and wanting to correct the situation for her daughter's sake.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She's standing up for her parenting decisions and her child's well-being.\n"
