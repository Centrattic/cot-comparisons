I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a 23-year-old single mom raising her daughter vegan, and her boyfriend's mom giving her daughter non-vegan dessert during a family gathering, despite the daughter's vegan diet. The main conflict is about the mom feeling disrespected and wanting to address it with the boyfriend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The mom has been vegan for 10 years and is raising her daughter vegan. She consults her doctor to ensure her daughter is healthy. That's important because it shows she's taking care of her child's health. The boyfriend's mom didn't give the vegan dessert and instead gave the non-vegan one, even when the mom had brought vegan options. The mom approached the situation calmly, explained it to her daughter, and gave her a vegan dessert. However, she's upset about the incident and considering confronting the boyfriend's mom.\n\nNow, considering the mom's perspective: she put effort into ensuring her daughter's dietary needs were met, communicated in advance, and prepared vegan desserts. The boyfriend's mom dismissed her concerns and made comments that undermined her parenting. The daughter was upset about eating animal products, which the mom had been careful to explain in an age-appropriate way. This suggests the mom is consistent in her parenting and values her daughter's choices.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's mom's actions could be seen as disregarding the mom's wishes and the agreed-upon arrangements. Even if the mom's mom didn't agree with the vegan diet, she should have respected the parent's decision, especially since the mom is consulting with a doctor and ensuring health. The comment about \"meat on her bones\" implies a belief that the vegan diet is unhealthy, which conflicts with the mom's medical consultations.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The mom made efforts to communicate and prepare, and the boyfriend's mom didn't adhere to the agreed-upon plan. The boyfriend's mom's actions and comments were disrespectful. The mom's reaction to address the situation calmly and correct the mistake seems reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's mom is the one who didn't respect the arrangements. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
