I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mom raising her daughter vegan and an incident at her boyfriend's mom's house where the kid ended up eating non-vegan dessert. The mom is upset because the grandmother substituted the vegan dessert with non-vegan, which the mom found disrespectful.\n\nFirst, the mom is a single parent who's been vegan for 10 years and decided to raise her daughter that way. She checks with the doctor to ensure her daughter is healthy, so there's a conscious effort to provide a balanced diet. That seems responsible on her part. She brought vegan desserts to the event, and the grandmother served a non-vegan one instead. The mom confronted her, but the grandmother dismissed her, making comments about \"real food\" and \"meat on her bones,\" which the mom found offensive.\n\nThe question is whether the mom is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points:\n\n1. **Parental Rights and Child's Diet**: Parents have the right to make dietary choices for their children, especially when those choices are vetted by doctors. Since the mom is ensuring her daughter's health is maintained, her decision to raise her vegan isn't inherently wrong. However, the mom's choice isn't the issue here; the incident at the family gathering is.\n\n2. **Respect and Boundaries**: The mom brought vegan desserts, which implies she communicated her needs. The grandmother, despite that, replaced the vegan option, possibly without consent. This action disregards the mom's dietary preferences and the child's needs. The grandmother's comments were disrespectful, attacking the mom's parenting choices. That's a red flag.\n\n3. **Conflict and Communication**: The mom approached the situation calmly, trying to understand the mistake. The grandmother's response was dismissive and condescending. The mom then took action to correct the situation for her daughter. This shows she was proactive in protecting her child's dietary needs. \n\n4. **Aftermath and Feelings**: The mom felt disrespected, which is valid given the grandmother's attitude. The daughter was also upset, adding emotional weight to the situation. The mom's desire to address the grandmother is understandable, especially to prevent future issues.\n\nNow, considering if the mom is in the wrong. If the grandmother went against the mom's explicit request and substituted the food, that's a clear violation. The mom had taken precautions (bringing her own food) and communicated her needs. The grandmother's actions were inconsiderate and possibly harmful, especially without consulting the mom. The mom's reaction was a response to being undermined, which is a natural response when someone challenges your parenting choices in front of your child.\n\nHowever, one might argue that the grandmother's intention was to feed the child \"real food,\" but that doesn't justify disrespecting the parent's decisions. The mom's right to make dietary choices for her child is paramount, especially when those choices are healthy and vetted by professionals.\n\nIn terms of the mother's actions post-incident, wanting to confront the grandmother is about setting boundaries and preventing future occurrences. It's about protecting her child's health and her own parental authority. The mom isn't in the wrong for wanting to address this; in fact, she's advocating for her child's needs.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The grandmother's actions were the problem. The mom acted appropriately by bringing her own food and addressing the issue when it occurred. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
