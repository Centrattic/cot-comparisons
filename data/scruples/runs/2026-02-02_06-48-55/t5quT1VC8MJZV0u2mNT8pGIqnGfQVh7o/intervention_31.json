I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mom who's raising her daughter vegan, and during a family gathering, the boyfriend's mom served non-vegan dessert to the daughter despite being given vegan options. The author is upset about this and considering confronting the mother-in-law.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that she's been vegan for ten years and that she raises her daughter vegan with a doctor's approval. So, from her perspective, she's making a conscious, informed decision that's in her child's best interest. She also prepared vegan desserts to bring along, which shows she tried to accommodate the occasion without compromising her values. \n\nThe issue arises when the daughter ended up eating non-vegan dessert. The author noticed this and confronted her boyfriend's mom, who responded dismissively, even making comments about the child needing \"meat on her bones.\" The daughter was upset because she loves animals, which the author had explained in a way that's age-appropriate. \n\nFrom the author's side, she felt disrespected and that her parenting choices were undermined. The mother-in-law's actions could be seen as overstepping, even if unintentionally. However, the author did mention that she might be paranoid and assumed the worst intentions. But when confronted, the mother-in-law didn't apologize or take responsibility, instead making derogatory remarks about the vegan diet. \n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong for raising her child vegan? The key points here are whether the diet is safe (which she confirmed with a doctor) and the mother-in-law's interference. Raising a child vegan isn't inherently wrong if it's done properly and medically monitored. The author did that. The conflict here is more about the mother-in-law's actions and the author's response to them.\n\nThe author's anger and decision to confront the mother-in-law could be seen as justified because the mother-in-law not only disregarded the arrangement but also insulted her parenting. However, the author did prepare alternatives, which shows she tried to prevent the issue. The mother-in-law's response was the main problem. \n\nSo, based on the information given, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing a vegan diet for her child, especially since it's medically approved. The issue lies with the mother-in-law's actions and response. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
