I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a single mom raising her daughter vegan, and during a visit to her boyfriend's mom's house, there's an incident where the daughter is given non-vegan dessert despite the mom bringing vegan options.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mom has been vegan for 10 years and ensures her daughter's diet is healthy with doctor supervision. She prepared vegan desserts to avoid any issues. However, the boyfriend's mom served non-vegan dessert to the daughter, which upset the mom because she thought it was intentional.\n\nThe key points here are: the mom planned ahead, the daughter was given non-vegan food despite the vegan options, and the boyfriend's mom made comments about the vegan diet. The mom confronted her but was dismissed. Now, she's considering bringing it up again, but is she in the wrong?\n\nFrom the mom's perspective, she's trying to respect her daughter's dietary needs, which are based on her moral beliefs and health. She went to the effort to provide vegan options. The boyfriend's mom's actions could be seen as disregarding those choices. However, maybe the mom overreacted? Did she assume the worst without confirming? She noticed the dessert wasn't being cut, assumed the worst, confronted, and then the mom snapped. But the daughter ended up eating non-vegan, which upset her because she loves animals.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's mom might have thought it's okay to let the child try \"real food,\" not realizing the impact. But the mom had clearly communicated the dietary needs beforehand. So, the BF mom might be at fault for not respecting that. However, the original question is about whether the author (the mom) is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to decide.\n\nThe author's actions: She asked in advance if they needed separate food, which they did except for veggies. She brought her own. She noticed the problem, confronted politely, got a rude response, then later tried to address it with her daughter. She's now considering bringing it up again. Was her confrontation appropriate? She didn't accuse immediately but checked first. Then, after the incident, she's upset. But bringing it up again might escalate tensions. However, she's also trying to protect her daughter's beliefs. \n\nThe BF mom's comments about \"real food\" and \"meat on her bones\" are problematic. The author's concern is valid in ensuring her daughter's diet is respected. However, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like not bringing it up again but ensuring next time. Or maybe she's justified in wanting the BF mom to know her actions were hurtful.\n\nIn terms of medical advice, the author says she consults the doctor and her daughter is healthy. So the vegan diet isn't harmful. The BF mom's comment implying otherwise could be ignorant. The daughter was upset because she likes animals, which shows she's aware of the ethics, so being forced into non-vegan food might contradict her values.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's protecting her child's health and beliefs, communicated her needs, and the BF mom didn't respect that. The author's reaction is understandable. Therefore, answer B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
