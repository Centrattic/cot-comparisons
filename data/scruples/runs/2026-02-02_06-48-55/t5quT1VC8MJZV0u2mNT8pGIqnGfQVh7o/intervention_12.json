I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about her daughter eating non-vegan dessert at her boyfriend's mom's house. The author is a vegan mom who made sure her daughter follows a vegan diet, and she prepared vegan desserts to take along. The boyfriend's mom served the non-vegan dessert to the daughter, which upset the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author's reasoning: she's been vegan for 10 years, consulted doctors to ensure her daughter's health, and the boyfriend's mom took it upon herself to serve non-vegan food without consulting the author. The author might have communicated her preferences in advance, but the mom didn't respect that. \n\nThe author's mom-in-law's actions could be seen as overstepping. She changed the plan, which the author had set up, and maybe even intentionally tried to undermine her dietary choices. The daughter was upset later when she found out, which adds emotional weight.\n\nBut wait, maybe the author should have been more vigilant. She did bring the desserts, but perhaps she didn't stay close enough to ensure the right one was served. However, the mom-in-law didn't ask the author before serving the non-vegan dessert. The author's main issue is feeling disrespected and that her parenting choice was undermined.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If someone else in the family, especially a non-guardian, decides to override the parent's dietary choices for the child without consent, that's a problem. The author isn't the one who served the non-vegan food; the other mom did. The author's reaction seems reasonable given the context. She tried to prepare in advance, and the other person didn't respect that. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author overreacted. But considering the daughter's well-being and the effort to keep her diet vegan, it's about respecting parental decisions. The other mom's comments about \"real food\" and \"meat on her bones\" are dismissive and possibly harmful. The author is defending her parenting choice, which is valid. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The mom-in-law's actions were the issue. The author's response in addressing the situation seems justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
