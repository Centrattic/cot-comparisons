I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, a young single mom, raised her daughter vegan for 10 years. She's been doing this with her doctor's approval, so the child's health is taken care of. Now she's dating a non-vegan guy, and they went to his mom's house for a holiday dinner. The mom had asked the author to bring her own food, which she did. However, during dessert, the boyfriend's mom served the daughter a non-vegan dessert instead of the vegan one the author had brought. The mother confronted her, and the mom-in-law was dismissive, making comments about the child needing meat to \"put some meat on her bones\" and implying the author's parenting was wrong.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong for being upset and considering confronting the boyfriend's mom? The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the facts. The author is a single parent making a conscious decision to raise her child vegan, which she's done with medical oversight. That's important because it shows she's prioritizing her child's health. The boyfriend's mom, despite being told to prepare non-vegan food for the author and her daughter, ends up serving the daughter non-vegan food. The author confronts her, and the mom responds disrespectfully. The daughter is upset because she loves animals and didn't want to eat animal products.\n\nNow, should the author be in the wrong? Well, she's acting in her child's best interest based on her dietary choices and values. The mom-in-law's actions were a breach of the agreed-upon arrangement. The author had even prepared the vegan desserts in advance, so the mom-in-law's actions were a deliberate choice, not a misunderstanding. The author's reaction is understandable because she's trying to protect her child's well-being and values. The mom-in-law's comments are not only rude but also undermine the author's parenting choices. \n\nThe key points here are: the mother's right to make dietary choices for her child under medical guidance, the agreement to bring her own food, the mom-in-law's breach of that agreement, and the subsequent disrespectful comments. The author's desire to address this with the boyfriend's mom is a reasonable response to being disrespected and ensuring her child's needs are met. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
