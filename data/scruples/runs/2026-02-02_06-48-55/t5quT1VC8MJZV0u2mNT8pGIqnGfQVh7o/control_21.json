I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a mom who's raised her daughter vegan for five years, and she's a single mom who's been vegan for ten years. She's careful to check with the doctor that her daughter is healthy. Now, when she goes to her boyfriend's mom's house for Christmas, she brings her own vegan desserts to avoid cross-contamination. The boyfriend's mom serves non-vegan desserts to her daughter, and when the author confronts her, the mom is dismissive and makes rude comments about the diet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is a parent who made a deliberate choice to raise her child vegan, which she's maintained for years and ensured is healthy with medical guidance. That's a responsible approach. The boyfriend's mom, on the other hand, took it upon herself to feed the child non-vegan food despite being informed in advance about the dietary needs. This could be a breach of trust or respect for the parent's decisions. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author communicated her daughter's dietary needs beforehand. 2) The boyfriend's mom disregarded that by serving non-vegan desserts. 3) The mom made derogatory remarks implying the author's diet is inadequate. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong for being upset and considering confronting the mother. From a legal and ethical standpoint, parents have the right to make dietary choices for their children, provided they're safe. The author's approach seems valid here. The boyfriend's mom overstepped by interfering without consent and making judgmental comments. The author's reaction is about standing up for her parenting choices and ensuring her child's diet is respected. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a perspective where the author could have been more vigilant in monitoring the situation, but given that she had asked to prepare her own food and desserts, it's reasonable to expect that the host would accommodate. The mom's actions were not only disrespectful but also potentially harmful if the non-vegan desserts had something that could affect the child's health. \n\nAlso, the daughter was upset after learning she ate animal products, which aligns with the mother's values. The boyfriend's mom's behavior might stem from disapproval, but that doesn't justify her actions. The author's intent to confront her is about setting boundaries, which is understandable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She had a valid reason for being upset, and the boyfriend's mom's actions were the main issue here. The author was protecting her child's dietary needs and her own parenting decisions.\n"
