I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the scenario where she raised her child as a vegan and her boyfriend's mom gave her daughter non-vegan food without her consent.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The mom is vegan and has been for 10 years. She's a single mom, raised her daughter vegan. She consults a doctor to ensure her daughter is healthy. Now, when visiting her boyfriend's mom, the mom didn't feed the child vegan food, even though she was supposed to. The author noticed and confronted her, leading to a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are parental rights and responsibilities. As a parent, you have the right to make decisions about your child's diet, including dietary restrictions for health, ethical, or moral reasons. The boyfriend's mom, without consulting the author, changed the child's meal, which could be seen as overstepping. The author had even brought vegan options, indicating her intent to stick to her dietary choices. The mother-in-law's comment about \"real food\" and \"meat on her bones\" suggests disrespect towards the author's parenting choices.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical standpoint: In many places, parents have the legal authority to make dietary decisions for their children. Unless a court has granted custody or decision-making rights to someone else, the mother has the right to choose her child's diet. The mother-in-law's actions could be seen as violating that trust and the child's rights to the diet the parents have chosen.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of communication. The author had discussed bringing her own food, so the mother-in-law was aware of the dietary restrictions. Despite that, she still altered the meal. This shows a lack of respect for the mother's wishes and could be considered negligent, especially if the child has health considerations tied to her diet.\n\nThe author's reaction\u2014confronting the mother-in-law calmly and explaining the mistake\u2014seems reasonable. The mother-in-law's defensive response adds to the tension. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to address the issue, especially since it affected her child's well-being and her relationship with her daughter.\n\nIn terms of the question, the author isn't wrong for raising her child vegan, provided it's nutritionally adequate, which she mentions checking with a doctor. The mother-in-law's actions are the problem here. The author's desire to address the situation to prevent future issues is understandable and appropriate. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
