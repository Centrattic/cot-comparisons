I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a mom raising her daughter vegan, and during a family gathering, the boyfriend's mom gave the daughter a non-vegan dessert instead of the vegan one the mom brought. The mom is upset and considering confronting the mother-in-law.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mom's perspective. She's a single parent who's been vegan for 10 years and is careful to ensure her child's diet is healthy. She prepared vegan desserts and expected them to be served. The mother-in-law, despite being told about the vegan options, gave the daughter a non-vegan dessert, making the mom feel disrespected. The daughter was upset too, not because of the dessert itself, but because she found out it wasn't vegan.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother-in-law might have had good intentions. She could have thought that the child needed more protein or that it was a special occasion to try \"real\" food. However, her approach was dismissive and possibly disrespectful towards the mother's dietary choices and parenting decisions. The way she snapped at the mom and commented on her ability to feed the child properly is problematic. She didn't consider the mom's values or her child's preferences, which could lead to a conflict.\n\nThe key points here are respect and communication. The mother-in-law had the opportunity to discuss the situation beforehand but didn't. Instead, she took it upon herself to make a decision that affected the child's diet without consulting the parent. The mom's reaction, while passionate, stems from wanting to protect her child's diet and values. She did take steps to ensure the child could still eat the vegan option, showing she's considerate of others but also firm on her stance.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the mother-in-law's actions were disrespectful and overstepped. The mom isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and addressing the issue. She's within her rights to defend her parenting choices, especially when her child's health and beliefs are involved. Confronting the mother-in-law could be necessary to prevent future misunderstandings and to assert her parenting authority.\n"
