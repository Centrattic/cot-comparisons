I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves a mom raising her daughter vegan, going to her boyfriend's mom's house, and the mom's mom serves non-vegan dessert to the child without permission.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The mom is 23, a single parent, vegan for 10 years. She ensures her daughter's diet is healthy with a doctor's help. She asked the boyfriend's mom in advance to bring her own food, which she did. The daughter ended up eating non-vegan dessert. The mom confronts the boyfriend's mom, who responds disrespectfully. The mom is upset because the grandmother didn't inform the child's parent before giving her non-vegan food, which conflicts with the mom's parenting choices.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to see if that's justified. Let's break it down:\n\n1. **Parenting Rights**: Parents have the right to make dietary choices for their children based on their values, as long as it's safe. The mom is following medical advice to ensure her daughter is healthy. The grandmother overstepped by feeding the child without consent, which could be a violation of the parent's authority.\n\n2. **Communication**: The mom did inform the grandmother in advance about bringing her own food, so the grandmother should have respected that. The grandmother's actions suggest she didn't take the mom's dietary preferences seriously, possibly out of disdain for the vegan lifestyle.\n\n3. **Child's Well-being**: The grandmother's comment about \"meat on her bones\" implies she believes the vegan diet is inadequate, despite the mom consulting a doctor. This undermines the parent's decisions and could affect the child's trust in her mother's choices.\n\n4. **Conflict Resolution**: The mom approached the grandmother calmly after the incident. The grandmother's dismissive response (\"shushed her\") indicates a lack of respect, which the mom is justified in feeling upset about.\n\n5. **Intentions**: The grandmother may have thought she was being kind by giving the child \"real food,\" but without permission, it's a breach of trust. The mom's anger stems from feeling disrespected and worried about her daughter's health and values.\n\nConsidering these points, the mother's actions in standing up for her parenting choices aren't in the wrong. The grandmother's actions were the issue. So the answer should be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
