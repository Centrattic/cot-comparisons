I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, a vegan mother, who took her daughter to her boyfriend's mother's house for a holiday meal. The author brought vegan desserts, but her boyfriend's mom served non-vegan desserts to the daughter. The author is upset and considering confronting her.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is a single mom who's been vegan for 10 years and has her daughter on a vegan diet, checked by a doctor. She's respectful of her boyfriend's non-vegan diet but he respects her choice. The issue arises when the daughter is given non-vegan desserts despite the author bringing vegan ones. The mother confronts her boyfriend's mom, who responds dismissively, leading to tension.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The mother's intention was to provide a vegan dessert for her daughter, which aligns with her parenting choices and medical advice. She communicated her needs in advance, bringing her own food. The boyfriend's mom, however, served non-vegan desserts, possibly without consulting the author. The author's reaction\u2014being upset and considering confrontation\u2014is about protecting her child's dietary needs and values.\n\nPossible arguments that the author is in the wrong: Maybe she overreacted, or her boyfriend's mom was trying to be kind. But since the daughter's diet is medically supervised, the author has a valid reason to ensure compliance. The boyfriend's mom's comment about \"real food\" and undermining the mother's choices is problematic. The author's decision to correct the situation and explain to her daughter seems reasonable. Confronting the mother-in-law might be necessary to set boundaries, especially if there's a pattern of disrespect.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did prepare her own food, which shows she made efforts to accommodate her diet and her daughter's. The boyfriend's mom's actions could be seen as disrespectful, given prior notice. The author's anger is about her child's well-being and her own parenting choices being undermined. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The mother-in-law's actions were inappropriate, and the author has a right to address it.\n"
