I've been vegan for ten years, so when I became a single mom at 18 i decided I'd raise my daughter vegan too, because that's how I eat and the sort of morals I'd like my daughter to have in the future if it's what she chooses. Of course, I make sure with my doctor that my daughter is completely healthy in her diet every time we visit, and I wouldn't continue with the lifestyle if it was making my daughter worse off in any way. \n\nI started dating a new guy two years ago, who is not vegan. He is totally respectful and eats vegan in my house too, which I really appreciate. No issue there. However, we went to his mother's house for Christmas dinner on Boxing Day. I asked in advance if his mom wanted me to make my own food for me and my daughter to take, which she did apart from the veg, so I came fully prepared to feed us and I also brought a couple vegan desserts for everyone to try if they wanted to. My boyfriend's mom had the whole extended family over that day so there were a lot of other kids there, so naturally my daughter started playing with them. \n\nAfter we all ate and were ready for dessert, I noticed her cutting the desserts for the kids (they were sitting at a little table altogether) but I didn't see her cutting either of the ones I'd bought, so I asked my daughter if she wanted anything and she said she did, so I left it and assumed my boyfriend's mom was just cutting her's last to avoid cross contamination or whatever. Five minutes later, I notice that she still hasn't cut the vegan dessert, and I look at my daughter to see her eating a dessert that's not vegan that she had prepared. I was fuming, because she had gone out of her way to serve my daughter after everyone else so I assumed she'd done this so she could sneak the non-vegan meal to my kid, but at the same time I assumed I'm just paranoid so I went into the kitchen to ask her why she'd done that (in a friendly way just in case it was an accident) and she basically snapped something along the lines of \"well it's Christmas, what does it matter if your daughter gets to taste real food for once in her life?\" and basically goes on to say it'd put some \"meat on her bones\" and that I \"don't know how to feed a child properly\". I know it sounds ridiculous, I was outraged and couldn't believe it, but she walked off right after back into the dining room so I just followed her back after a few second, calmly explained to my daughter that she'd been mistakenly given the wrong dessert (which made her really upset, because she loves animals) and gave her a small slice of one of the desserts I'd brought. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter we left, I was still pretty angry about what happened and asked my daughter if she was okay, and she basically ended up telling me that she asked my boyfriend's mom why it wasn't one of the things I'd brought along and she just shushed her and said it's okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nNow I know this isn't catastrophic or anything but I just feel so disrespected and undermined by a woman who I already felt like didn't approve of me. It also upset my daughter a bit to know she'd eaten animal products (just wanna say, I haven't told her the gross parts of animal products, just that it hurts them and I think that's enough until she's older). So basically, WIBTA if I brought this back up to my boyfriend's mom and told her how upsetting it was? I want her to know it's unacceptable but she already doesn't seem to like me so I might just not eat with her again or if I do, pay closer attention to make sure she's not doing something similar.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The key points here are about raising a child vegan, the interaction with the boyfriend's mom during a family dinner, and whether the author's response was appropriate.\n\nFirst, the author is a single mom who's been vegan for 10 years and decided to raise her daughter that way. She consults her doctor to ensure her daughter's health, which suggests she's taking the diet seriously and responsibly. So, from a health standpoint, there's no issue mentioned. Her choice is based on moral reasons, which is a personal decision many people make.\n\nNow, the situation at her boyfriend's mom's house. The author took precautions by bringing her own vegan desserts and informing the mom in advance. She even brought extras for others to try, showing consideration. The problem arose when the mom served non-vegan dessert to the author's daughter. The author confronted her, and the mom responded disrespectfully, implying that the vegan diet isn't proper for a child. This response is problematic because it undermines the parent's choice and is condescending. The mom's comment about the child needing \"meat on her bones\" is both unkind and dismissive, suggesting a lack of respect for the parent's dietary decisions.\n\nThe author then gave her daughter a slice of the vegan dessert, which is a reasonable response to correct the mistake. The daughter was upset, which adds emotional weight to the situation. The author's anger stems from feeling disrespected and concerned about her daughter's exposure to non-vegan food against her wishes. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for confronting the mother-in-law. The author's actions were to address an intentional or negligent mistake by someone else. The mother-in-law's behavior was the initial problem, so the author's response\u2014calmly explaining the situation to her daughter and addressing the mistake\u2014is justified. The author's desire to confront the mother-in-law again is about seeking acknowledgment and respect, which is reasonable given the disrespectful treatment received.\n\nConsidering all this, the mother-in-law's actions were the root issue. The author acted responsibly in maintaining her daughter's diet and health, and her response was appropriate given the circumstances. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
