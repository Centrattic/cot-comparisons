She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is rocky, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health episode and admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward. They told their mom, who then told everyone, leading to a confrontation where the mom didn't take responsibility. Now, the mom opened a business in the author's name with possible tax and legal issues.\n\nThe author is torn between reporting her for these illegal activities versus the mom's past support. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nSo, legally, if someone is committing fraud or other crimes, reporting them is the right thing to do. But the moral aspect here is tricky because of their personal relationship. The mom did help the author during a vulnerable time, but she also breached trust by not keeping the author's mental health issue private and now seems to be involved in illegal activities.\n\nThe key points are: the mom's actions are illegal, which the author has evidence of. The author is considering reporting her despite the mom's past support. Legally, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting illegal activities. Morally, it's a gray area because of the personal history, but the author isn't obligated to protect someone from legal consequences just because of family ties. The mom's betrayal and refusal to take responsibility might factor into the author's decision, but the legal right to report remains.\n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
