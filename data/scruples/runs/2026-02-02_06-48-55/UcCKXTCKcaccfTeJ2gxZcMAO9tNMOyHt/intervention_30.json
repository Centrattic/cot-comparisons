She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation involves a complicated family dynamic. The mom is described as a compulsive liar and narcissist with bipolar disorder. She told everyone about the author's psychiatric hospitalization, which was supposed to be confidential. Now the author found out the mom started a business in their name and might be doing shady things with taxes and insurance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the mom is using the author's name for a business without permission, that's identity theft. The author has the right to report that, regardless of their personal feelings. Also, if the mom is committing tax fraud or operating without proper insurance, those are legal violations. The author isn't in the wrong for reporting illegal activities, even if the person involved is a family member.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The mom has a history of betrayal and lack of empathy. The author is grateful for the support during their mental health crisis but feels used. The mom's actions have caused significant harm\u2014sharing private information, not taking responsibility, and now using the author's identity. The author's decision to report her would be based on protecting their own interests and legal rights, not just anger or revenge.\n\nSome might argue that the author should handle it through family channels first, but given the mom's history of not taking responsibility, reporting might be the only effective option. The author isn't obligated to protect someone who has repeatedly betrayed them, especially when it's illegal. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
