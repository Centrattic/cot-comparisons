She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is considering turning in their mom. The mom has a history of lying, narcissism, and bipolar disorder. The author told their mom about their psychiatric hospitalization, asked her not to tell anyone, but she did. Then the author moved in with her, and now the mom opened a business in the author's name and might be doing some shady stuff, like tax evasion or using the business account for personal expenses. The author is torn between reporting her and feeling grateful for her help over the past years.\n\nFirst, the mom's actions: she violated the trust of her child by sharing confidential information. She's also using the child's name for a business without their consent, which is illegal. The business has potential illegal activities like tax evasion and lack of insurance. The author is considering turning her in. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by doing so. The key points here are legality and ethics. Legally, if the mom committed a crime (using someone else's name without consent, tax fraud, etc.), the author isn't in the wrong for reporting her. It's the right thing to do to prevent illegal activities, even if it's a family member. However, there's the emotional aspect: the author is grateful for the help during their depression. But the mom's actions were harmful (betrayal of trust, illegal business practices), so the author has a right to protect themselves and others by reporting the crimes. \n\nThe mom's mental health issues might explain her behavior, but it doesn't make her actions right. The author isn't responsible for the mom's actions. The author is not in the wrong for choosing to report a family member when there's evidence of criminal behavior. The mom's past help doesn't obligate the author to stay silent about legal violations. So, the answer should be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
