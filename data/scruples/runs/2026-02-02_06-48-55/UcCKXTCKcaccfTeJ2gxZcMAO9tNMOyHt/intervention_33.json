She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The scenario is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as a compulsive liar and narcissist with bipolar disorder. The author has a strained relationship, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, told their mom, and then moved back in. The mom broke the author's confidentiality by telling others, and when confronted, gave a dismissive apology. Now, the mom started a business under the author's name with possible tax and legal issues.\n\nThe author is torn between the mom's past help and the potential legal wrongdoing. They're wondering if turning her in is wrong. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions.\n\nLooking at the elements: the mom's actions (opening a business in someone else's name, possible tax evasion, lack of insurance) are illegal. The author is considering reporting her, which is a legal and ethical action. However, the author is conflicted because the mom provided shelter and support during a vulnerable time. But the mom also violated trust and confidentiality before, which might justify the author's concern for their own integrity.\n\nThe key points are whether the mom's actions are indeed illegal, and if reporting her is justified despite the personal relationship. The author's decision to report might be about protecting their own reputation and preventing harm, not just revenge. However, the author could also consider other options like confronting the mom again or seeking legal advice before taking action. But based on the info given, the mom's actions seem to have crossed into illegal territory, so reporting might be the right thing to do. So the answer might be B (author not in the wrong), since they're acting against illegal behavior.\n"
