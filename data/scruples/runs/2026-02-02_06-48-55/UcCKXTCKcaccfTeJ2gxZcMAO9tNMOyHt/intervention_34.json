She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author had a mental health crisis and admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, then told their mom, who then spread that information. The mom also opened a business in the author's name without permission and might be doing shady tax stuff.\n\nFirst, the mom's actions are clearly problematic. Using someone's identity without consent for a business is illegal. The mom also violated the author's trust by sharing their personal health information, which breaches confidentiality. The mom's refusal to take responsibility and her manipulative apology add to the issue.\n\nThe author is considering reporting the mom despite the mom's past support (like letting them stay rent-free). The key factors here are the illegality of the mom's actions and the breach of trust. Even though the mom provided some support, the author's mental health and safety are important. Reporting illegal activities is a civic duty, and the author isn't obligated to stay silent due to past kindnesses, especially if those acts were harmful.\n\nHowever, there's a conflict between the legal wrongdoing and the personal relationship. The author might feel conflicted about betraying their mom, but the mom's actions are unlawful. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking justice or protecting themselves. The mom's past behavior (lying, narcissism) makes it less likely that she acted in the author's best interest when opening the business.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the mom. The answer should be B.\n"
