She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The author was in a psychiatric ward and told their mom, who then betrayed their trust by spreading the information. The mom also started a business in the author's name with possible tax and insurance issues.\n\nFirst, the author's mom violated their trust by telling others about the psychiatric stay. Then, she started a business using the author's name, which might involve illegal activities. The key points here are the mom's actions and the author's response. The author is considering turning her in because of these issues. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the mom used the author's name without consent and potentially committed fraud, the author has a right to report her for legal violations. The fact that the mom helped the author by letting them live rent-free doesn't negate the illegal actions. The author isn't being malicious; they're reacting to a breach of trust and possible crimes. \n\nOn the other hand, someone might argue that the author should forgive past transgressions, but legally and ethically, reporting illegal activities is a responsibility. The mom's past behavior justifies the author's lack of trust. So, the author isn't in the wrong for pursuing legal action here.\n"
