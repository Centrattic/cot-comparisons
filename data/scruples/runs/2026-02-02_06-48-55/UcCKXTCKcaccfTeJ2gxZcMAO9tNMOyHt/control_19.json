She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they'd be in the wrong for turning in their mom. The mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The user had mental health issues and admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward. They told their mom, who then spread the information, leading to a confrontation. Now, the mom opened a business in the user's name and is possibly doing shady things with taxes and insurance.\n\nFirst, the user is considering reporting their mom. They feel torn because the mom provided a place to live for free. The question is whether the user is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nI need to assess the ethics here. The mom violated the user's trust by spreading the information about their mental health, which is a breach of confidentiality. Then, the mom used the user's name without permission to open a business, which sounds illegal. The user is concerned about reporting her, possibly because of past support, but the mom's actions are harmful and possibly illegal.\n\nThe user isn't in the wrong for protecting themselves. The mom's actions are the issue here. Reporting illegal activities is a civic duty, even if it's a family member. The user was a victim of the mom's breach of trust and now of identity misuse. The mom's refusal to take responsibility and her manipulative behavior add to the justification for the user's actions. So the answer is B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
