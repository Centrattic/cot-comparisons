She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's mom did some shady stuff, like starting a business in the author's name without permission and possibly doing tax fraud. The author is considering turning her in but is conflicted because the mom has been helping them with housing after a mental health crisis.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the mom used the author's identity for a business without consent, that's identity theft, which is illegal. The mom is also engaging in possible tax evasion and not having proper insurance, which are also legal issues. The author has a right to protect their identity and report illegal activities, regardless of their relationship with their mom. So from a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the mom.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author is grateful for the housing but the mom has a history of lying and betraying trust. The mom also blamed the author for her own actions, which is toxic. The author might feel torn between gratitude and the need to report illegal behavior. However, the author's well-being is important. If the mom is a compulsive liar and narcissist, she might not change, so the author's mental health could suffer more by not taking action.\n\nAnother angle: the author was a victim of identity theft. They can report this legally without being in the wrong. The mom's actions are the main issue here. The author's decision to report is about rectifying the misuse of their identity and preventing further harm. The author isn't at fault for the mom's actions, so they don't owe her anything but to ensure justice is served.\n\nBut maybe some would argue that the author is being ungrateful because they're reporting someone who helped them. However, the help was under the condition that the author's mental health issue remained private, which the mom broke. The author's trust was already violated then, so the current situation is another breach. The author's priority should be their safety and legal rights, not just gratitude.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to turn in their mom for the illegal acts she committed. It's about protecting their identity and ensuring she faces consequences for her actions. The author's mental health and the mom's history of betrayal support the decision to report her.\n"
