She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Terrible for Admitting) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's mom, who has a complicated mental health history and a strained relationship with the author. The mom disclosed the author's mental health issues after being told not to, and now the author found out she started a business in their name with possible illegal activities.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the key points. The mom is a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is volatile, with long periods of silence. The author admitted to a psychiatric ward and told the mom, who then shared it with others, leading to a confrontation where the mom didn't apologize genuinely. Now, the mom used the author's name for a business without consent, which may have tax and legal issues.\n\nThe author is considering turning her in. The user thinks the author is in the wrong (option A), but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the mom's actions are unethical and possibly illegal, using her child's name fraudulently. On the other, the author had a troubled relationship, and the mom had done something for them (rent-free stay) which the author is grateful for, but the mom might be doing shady things.\n\nIs it the author's fault that the mom started the business? Probably not. The mom did it without permission. The author's decision to live with her after being in the ward was likely for their own benefit, and the mom's subsequent actions are hers to manage. The author's dilemma is between loyalty and legal/ethical responsibility.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The mom's actions are clearly problematic, but the author is considering reporting her. The author isn't being asked to ignore the law; if the mom is engaging in fraud or tax evasion, that's a legal issue. The author might be conflicted because of past support, but the mom's actions are her own. The author is not responsible for her mother's decisions to lie or engage in illegal activities. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking to report the mother. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
