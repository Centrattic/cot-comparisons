She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex. The mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author had mental health issues and ended up in a psychiatric ward. They told their mom about it, who then spread the information, leading to a confrontation. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with possible tax and legal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The mom used the author's name without consent, which is a serious issue. Using someone's identity for business, especially when it's illegal, is a crime. The author is considering reporting her, which would be the right thing legally. But there's the personal aspect: the mom helped the author during a tough time, providing a place to stay. However, the mom's actions here are harmful and potentially illegal. The author's trust was already broken, and the mom's betrayal in telling others about the mental health episode shows a pattern of dishonesty and self-centered behavior. \n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting their mom if there's evidence of fraudulent activity. Ethically, it's a tough call because of the personal relationship, but the mom's actions are wrong. The author might feel conflicted between gratitude and the need to act on their mom's misconduct. But the fact that the mom didn't get consent to use their name and is engaging in shady practices makes the author's potential action more about protecting themselves and upholding the law. So, the author isn't in the wrong for considering turning her in. The answer should be B.\n"
