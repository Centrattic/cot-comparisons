She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is complex. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar and narcissist, diagnosed with bipolar disorder. The author had mental health issues, went to a psychiatric ward, told their mom, who then broke their confidentiality by telling everyone. The author confronted her, but she didn't apologize genuinely. Then the mom opened a business in the author's name, which might have tax and legal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the mom is using the author's name for a business without their consent and it's illegal, then the author has a right to report it. Legal obligations might require reporting crimes, especially tax fraud or using someone's identity without permission. The mom's actions could be fraudulent, which is a crime. So legally, the author might not be in the wrong for reporting.\n\nEmotionally, the author is in a tough spot. They've had a strained relationship, but the mom did support them during a vulnerable time. However, the mom's betrayal of trust and the potential illegal activities complicate things. The author might feel conflicted between gratitude and the need to do the right thing legally.\n\nEthically, there's a balance between personal relationships and legal duties. While there's a personal obligation to the mom for the past support, the law doesn't typically consider past relationships when someone is committing fraud. So ethically, the author might be justified in reporting to prevent further harm or legal consequences for themselves, especially if the business is in their name.\n\nThe mom's lack of sincere apologies and history of manipulation might make the author feel that turning her in is necessary to protect themselves. The author could be protecting their own interests by ensuring they aren't implicated in the illegal activities.\n\nBut some might argue that the author is ungrateful for not considering the mom's past support. However, the mom's actions in opening a business under false pretenses might outweigh the previous support. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing legal compliance over personal feelings in this case.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
