She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation involves a complicated family dynamic with mental health issues and potential illegal activities.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as a compulsive liar and narcissist with bipolar disorder. She's been dishonest, like breaking the author's confidentiality about their mental health. Now she's running a business in the author's name that might be illegal. The author is torn between gratitude for her support and the desire to report her.\n\nThe key points to consider: Did the mom act illegally? If she used the author's identity without permission and engaged in fraudulent activities, that's a crime. The author might have the right to report her, especially if they were a victim of identity theft. However, the mom might argue she had permission since the author allowed her to use their name. But if the author didn't consent to the business in their name, that's a problem.\n\nMoral vs legal. Legally, if the mom committed fraud or tax evasion, the author could be complicit if they knew and didn't report. But since they found out after the fact, maybe not. Ethically, the author is conflicted between family loyalty and justice. The mom's past behavior complicates things\u2014her betrayal and lack of remorse might justify the author's decision.\n\nAlso, the author is grateful for the support during their mental health crisis, but that shouldn't override illegal actions. The mom's actions could harm the author legally if they're associated with the business. So, turning her in might be the responsible choice to protect themselves.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong legally if they report the mom's crimes. The complexity lies in their personal relationship, but legally, the mom's actions are the issue. The author is protecting their own interests and preventing further harm by reporting, which is understandable.\n"
