She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author's mom is described as a compulsive liar, a narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is strained, with periods of silence. The author had a mental health crisis, entered a psychiatric ward, and told their mom. They later moved back in with her. The mom broke confidentiality by telling others about the author's mental health, leading to conflict. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with questionable tax practices and lack of insurance. The author is considering reporting her.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. If the mom is using the author's name without permission for a business and engaging in tax evasion or other illegal activities, that's a legal issue. The author might be a victim here since their identity is being misused. Legally, the author has a responsibility to report fraud or illegal activities, especially if they're being used without consent. \n\nBut there's also the emotional and personal side. The mom helped the author by letting them live rent-free during a difficult time. The author is grateful but feels betrayed by the mom's past actions. The mom's behavior is manipulative and harmful, as seen in the broken confidentiality and lack of remorse.\n\nThe key question is whether turning in the mom is justified. Legally, yes. But morally, it's complex. The author might feel conflicted because of the mom's past support. However, the mom's actions are unethical and illegal, regardless of the personal relationship. The author isn't responsible for the mom's actions, especially since the mom acted without the author's consent. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for protecting their own legal standing and preventing further harm. The mom's actions are her own responsibility. So, while the emotional conflict is valid, the author isn't morally at fault for reporting the illegal activities. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
