She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: the mom is a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is strained, with periods of not speaking. The author had mental health issues and admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward. They told their mom, who then told everyone, which the author is upset about. The mom didn't apologize sincerely. Now, the mom opened a business in the author's name with possible illegal activities like tax evasion and lack of insurance.\n\nThe author is torn between gratitude for the mom's past support and the mom's betrayal and current illegal actions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they turn her in.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mom's actions: using the author's name without consent, engaging in shady business practices, and the mom's history of betrayal. The author is considering reporting her, which could have legal consequences. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if someone uses another person's name without permission for a business and commits tax fraud or other illegal acts, the person who owns the name (the author) might be liable. By not reporting, the author could be complicit. On the other hand, the author has a history of the mom betraying their trust, which adds emotional complexity.\n\nEthically, it's about whether the author has a duty to report illegal activities, regardless of the relationship. The mom's actions could harm the author legally if the business is linked to them. The author's gratitude for past support might conflict with their responsibility to prevent legal issues.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author might not be in the wrong because they're protecting themselves from legal repercussions. The mom's actions are the initial wrong, so the author is acting to mitigate harm. However, some might argue that the author should handle it through legal channels without \"turning in\" the mom, maybe by disavowing the business and reporting. But given the mom's pattern of behavior, the author might feel they have no choice but to report to prevent further issues.\n\nAlso, the mom's lack of sincere apology and history of betrayal could justify the author's decision to act in their own interest. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their well-being and legal safety over past favors. So the answer leaning towards B (No) makes sense here.\n"
