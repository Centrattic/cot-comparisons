She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The scenario involves a complicated relationship where the mom has issues like narcissism, bipolar disorder, and compulsive lying. The author told their mom about their mental health stay, which the mom then spread around, leading to a confrontation. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name and there are tax and insurance issues.\n\nFirst, the mom's actions definitely cross ethical and legal lines. Using someone's name without permission for a business is a serious breach of trust and potentially illegal. The shady tax practices and lack of proper insurance add to that. The author is considering reporting her, which is a valid response given the potential legal violations. However, the author feels conflicted because their mom provided a place to stay rent-free when they were struggling.\n\nBut the key here is that the mom is the one who acted wrongfully. The author didn't consent to the business being opened in their name. They didn't ask her to start a business, especially not under false pretenses. The fact that the mom lied before and showed no real remorse suggests she's untrustworthy and possibly manipulative. The author's decision to report her is more about protecting themselves and preventing further harm, not just revenge. Also, the author's mental health history might make them a victim here, using their vulnerability against them.\n\nSo even though the author might feel grateful for the shelter, the mom's actions are illegal and the author is within their rights to report her. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for doing so. The answer seems to be no because the mom initiated the wrongdoing. The author isn't taking advantage of their mom's generosity; they're addressing the harm done to them.\n"
