She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being dishonest and has mental health issues. She's a narcissist and bipolar, and they've had a strained relationship. The author told her about their mental health issues, and the mom broke that confidence by spreading it around. When confronted, the mom didn't take responsibility and gave a half-hearted apology. Then, the mom did something shady by opening a business in the author's name and engaging in questionable financial practices.\n\nThe author is now considering reporting their mom. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the facts.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for wanting to report their mom? Well, the mom's actions might be illegal\u2014using someone's name without consent, tax evasion, not having proper insurance. Those could be real issues. The author is in a tough spot, caught between gratitude for the mom's help and the need to address the illegal activities. \n\nBut does the author have a moral obligation to stay silent because their mom helped them? Or is it right to report crimes regardless of personal relationships? Also, using the mom's name for a business is a legal issue. The author might be protecting themselves from legal trouble by reporting this, since being associated with the business could affect them.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should try to resolve it directly first. But given the mom's history of not taking responsibility, that might not be effective. Also, the author might be a victim here, used without consent. \n\nSo, considering the illegal actions and the fact that the mom is the one who acted wrong, the author might not be in the wrong for reporting her. They're protecting their own interests and possibly preventing further harm. So answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
