She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar and narcissist, with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Their relationship is rocky, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health episode, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom about it. They moved back in with her, living rent-free, and were grateful. But the mom broke their confidentiality by spreading the information about the hospitalization. The author confronted her, and the mom didn't sincerely apologize. Then the mom opened a business in the author's name, which seems to be operating improperly with tax and insurance issues.\n\nNow, the author is considering turning her in. The key here is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the mom is engaging in potentially illegal activities by using the author's name without consent and running a business that's not compliant with tax and insurance laws. The author might be a victim here, as their identity is being used without permission. The author has a right to protect their identity and report illegal activities, regardless of their personal relationship with their mom. Also, the mom has shown a pattern of manipulative and dishonest behavior, which might justify the author taking action to protect themselves legally.\n\nOn the other hand, the author acknowledges that their mom has provided them with shelter and support during a vulnerable time. There's a sense of gratitude mentioned. However, the author is also in a position where they have been wronged multiple times\u2014broken confidentiality, lack of sincere apology, and now identity theft. The dilemma is whether the author has a moral obligation to overlook their mom's actions due to the past support, or if they have a right to seek justice for the current legal issues.\n\nAnother angle is the legal aspect. If the mom is indeed committing tax fraud or other illegal activities, the author isn't necessarily required to be the one to report her. However, if the author's identity is being used, they might be legally complicit or at risk if the business is found out. So, from a legal standpoint, the author might have a duty to report it to protect themselves from potential legal consequences. \n\nThe mom's actions in creating a business under the author's name could expose the author to legal liability if the business is involved in fraudulent activities. Therefore, the author might have a legitimate reason to report the business to avoid being implicated. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect their own interests and legal standing. The mom's past actions of betrayal and lack of remorse further support the author's decision to take action. So, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
