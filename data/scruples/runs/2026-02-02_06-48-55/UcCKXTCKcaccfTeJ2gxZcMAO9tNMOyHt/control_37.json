She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is considering turning in their mom because she started a business in the author's name and she's doing some shady things. The mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. They have a complicated relationship with periods of not speaking. \n\nThe author had a mental health crisis and admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward. They told their mom, who then told everyone, leading to a confrontation. The mom didn't apologize sincerely, which the author noticed. Now, the mom opened a business in the author's name, which might be illegal in terms of taxes and insurance. The author is torn about whether to report her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. If the mom used the author's name without permission and is engaging in illegal activities, then the author could be at risk. Legally, someone can't open a business in another person's name without consent, especially if it involves fraud. The author might be liable if they don't report it. \n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author is grateful for their mom's help in the past, but the mom has a history of betrayal and not taking responsibility. The author's mental health is also a factor here. They might feel trapped between their past gratitude and the current harm caused by their mom's actions.\n\nIs the author in the wrong if they report their mom? Well, if the mom's actions are illegal and the author is being used without consent, then the author isn't at fault. They might even have a duty to protect themselves and prevent being implicated in the crimes. However, the author might feel conflicted because of their mom's past support. But the mom's betrayal and lack of accountability could tip the scales. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is being harsh, but given the mom's history of dishonesty and the potential legal issues, the author isn't in the wrong for taking steps to protect themselves. The mom's actions could put the author in legal trouble, so reporting might be necessary regardless of personal feelings. \n\nSo, putting it together: the author is not in the wrong because they are protecting themselves from legal liability and the mom has a history of unethical behavior. The right answer would be B.\n"
