She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether turning in their mom is the right thing to do. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author's mom is described as a compulsive liar, a narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. They've had a complicated relationship with periods of not speaking. The author was in a psychiatric ward, told their mom about it, and moved back in with her. They asked her not to tell anyone, but she did, leading to a confrontation. Now, the mom opened a business in the author's name and might be doing some shady tax and insurance stuff.\n\nThe author is torn between turning her in and their gratitude for the support she provided. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they report her.\n\nI need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, if the mom is using the author's name without permission for a business and engaging in illegal activities (tax evasion, using business accounts for personal use, lack of insurance), then the author might have a legal obligation to report this. Using someone's identity fraudulently is a crime, so the author could be a victim here. In that case, reporting could be the right thing to do legally.\n\nMorally, it's more complex. The author is grateful for the support during a difficult time. However, the mom's actions of betraying their trust by spreading the information about the psychiatric stay and now using their identity for fraudulent business activities are serious. The mom's behavior is manipulative and harmful. The author might feel conflicted between their past gratitude and the current harm caused.\n\nThe mom's response to the betrayal was to deflect blame onto the author, which shows a lack of genuine remorse. The author has tried to confront her, but it's clear that the mom isn't going to change. The business in the author's name could lead to legal consequences for the author if it's exposed, so turning her in might be necessary to protect themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author has a duty to their family and that turning in a parent is a big step. But considering the mom's history of deceit and the author's potential victimization, the moral obligation to prevent further harm and protect themselves might outweigh the familial duty.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might not be in the wrong for reporting their mom because of the fraudulent activities being committed under their name, which could have legal repercussions for them if not addressed. The mom's actions are unethical and possibly illegal, so the author's decision to report her could be justified both legally and morally to prevent further harm and to protect their own interests.\n"
