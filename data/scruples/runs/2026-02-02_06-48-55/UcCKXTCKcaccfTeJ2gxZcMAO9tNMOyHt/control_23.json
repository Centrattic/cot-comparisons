She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mother. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions their mom is a compulsive liar, a narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is strained, with long periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health episode and was hospitalized, then told their mom. They moved back in with her, living rent-free. The mom promised not to tell anyone but did, which the author found out later. The mom didn't apologize properly and instead blamed the author for her feelings. Now, the author found out the mom opened a business in their name and possibly committed tax fraud or other shady practices.\n\nThe author is torn between reporting her and their gratitude for the support during their mental health struggle. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report their mom.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. If the mom is indeed committing fraud by using the author's name and not following tax laws, then the author might have a legal obligation to report it. However, the mom has a history of betrayal and manipulation, which complicates the situation.\n\nThe author's mental health history and the mom's behavior suggest a toxic dynamic. The mom's actions (breaking confidentiality, using the author's identity, possibly illegal activities) could be seen as exploitative. The author's decision to report could be self-protective and legally responsible, even if they feel conflicted about the mom's past support.\n\nBut maybe the author is being too harsh because of their personal feelings? The mom did help them during a vulnerable time. However, the mom's history of lying and not taking responsibility might make the author's actions understandable. Legally, if the mom is committing crimes, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting. The key is whether the mom's actions are illegal and if the author has a duty to report. If so, then the answer would be B (not in the wrong). If the author is overreacting or misinterpreting the situation, maybe A. But given the details, the author's intention is to stop illegal activities, which is the right thing to do.\n"
