She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated. The author is considering turning in their mom, who has a history of being a compulsive liar, a narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The mom told everyone about the author's mental health issues, which led to a confrontation. Now, the author found out the mom opened a business in their name and is doing shady things with taxes and insurance.\n\nFirst, the author is dealing with a difficult family relationship. The mom's actions of breaching confidentiality about the author's hospitalization and then not taking real responsibility are pretty serious. The mom's lack of sincere apologies and her narcissistic traits suggest she might not have the author's best interests at heart.\n\nNow, the mom started a business using the author's name without permission. That's a legal issue\u2014using someone's identity without consent can be fraud or identity theft. If the business is operating illegally (like tax evasion or lack of proper insurance), the author is liable because the business is in their name. The author might be at risk if the authorities come after them for these illegal activities.\n\nThe author is torn between reporting their mom and feeling grateful for her help during a tough time. But the mom's actions here could directly affect the author's legal standing. By not reporting the illegal activities, the author could be complicit or face consequences. The author's decision to report might be self-preservation as much as it is about upholding the law.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for reporting their mom? On one hand, they've been helped by their mom. On the other hand, the mom is using their identity for illegal purposes, which is a different issue. The author isn't being asked to forgive the mother's past actions, but to take action against ongoing potential crimes. The author isn't responsible for their mom's actions, so turning her in wouldn't be wrong. They're protecting their own legal and financial well-being while also addressing the misuse of their identity.\n\nSo, considering that the mom's actions are illegal and the author is a victim of identity theft and potential legal issues, the author is not in the wrong for reporting their mom. The answer should be B.\n"
