She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they report their mother. The situation involves a complicated relationship where the mother is accused of lying, narcissism, and possible tax evasion. The mother started a business in the author's name and might be doing shady things. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the mother used the author's name without permission to open a business, that's a legal issue. The author might have been a victim of identity theft or fraud. Reporting her could be the right thing legally, even if there's a personal relationship involved.\n\nThen there's the personal side. The author has a troubled history with their mom, who has mental health issues and a pattern of betrayal. The mother's actions of disclosing the author's mental health without consent and not taking responsibility are significant. The author feels grateful for the support during their mental health crisis but is also hurt by the mother's lack of accountability.\n\nEthically, the author is torn between gratitude and the need to report illegal activities. The mother's behavior, including the unauthorized use of the author's name and potential tax fraud, could cause legal trouble for the author if not addressed. The mother's previous denial of wrongdoing and her history of betrayal might justify the author taking action to protect themselves.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's decision to report their mother isn't about being in the wrong. They are protecting themselves from legal repercussions and exposing the mother's illegal activities. The mother's actions are the primary issue here, not the author's intent to report. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
