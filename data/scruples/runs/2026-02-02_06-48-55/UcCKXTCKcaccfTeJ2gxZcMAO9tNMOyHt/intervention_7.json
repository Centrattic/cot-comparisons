She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complex because it involves family, mental health, and potential legal issues.\n\nFirst, the author's mother is described as a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The relationship is strained, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis and ended up in a psychiatric ward. Afterward, they told their mom, which led to her sharing that information, which the author was upset about. The mom didn't apologize sincerely, which the author is used to.\n\nNow, the mom opened a business in the author's name and there are indications of possible illegal activities like tax evasion, using the business account for personal expenses, and lack of proper insurance. The author is considering turning her in.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author wrong to consider reporting their mom?\n\nFactors to consider: \n\n1. **Legal obligations**: If the mom is committing crimes under the author's name, the author might be legally implicated. Even if the author didn't know, being a named business owner without consent could lead to legal issues for them. In that case, reporting might be necessary to protect themselves.\n\n2. **Moral responsibility**: The author might feel morally obligated to report the illegal activities, especially if they could harm others or if the mom is exploiting the situation.\n\n3. **Family and past actions**: The mom has a history of betrayal, lies, and not taking responsibility. The author has been living with her and has been grateful, but the mom's actions have been harmful. The past favors might make the author hesitant, but the mother's ongoing unethical behavior could tip the balance.\n\n4. **Intent of the author**: The author's intention in reporting could be self-protection or to stop illegal activities. If it's the latter, it might be justified. If it's revenge, maybe not.\n\nLegal advice would be important here. If the author is being used without their knowledge, they might have no choice but to report to clear their name and prevent legal trouble. However, if they have some level of complicity (even unknowingly), that complicates things.\n\nBut since the author didn't consent to the business being opened in their name, they are not complicit. The mother's actions are fraudulent. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for reporting to protect themselves and prevent misuse of their identity. They might be right to take action given the mother's history of dishonesty and the potential legal risks.\n"
