She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they turn in their mom for starting a business in her name and possibly doing shady things. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author has a complicated relationship with their mom, who has mental health issues and a history of lying and narcissism. The author had a mental health crisis, told their mom about it, and then the mom spread the information. The author confronted her, but she didn't take responsibility. Now, the mom opened a business under the author's name and might be involved in tax fraud or other illegal activities.\n\nSo, the author is considering reporting their mom, despite her providing shelter. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if someone is using another person's identity for a business without their consent and is involved in fraudulent activities, that's a criminal offense. The author's mom used their name without permission, which could lead to legal issues for the author if not addressed. The author might be a victim here, so reporting the mom could protect the author from future legal problems.\n\nHowever, there's a personal angle. The mom did help the author during a tough time by letting them live rent-free. The author is conflicted between gratitude and the need to do what's right legally. But legally, the mom's actions are wrong regardless of past kindness. The author isn't obligated to stay silent about a crime, even if it's a family member.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could first try to resolve it privately, like confronting the mom again and threatening legal action if she doesn't stop. But if there's evidence of fraud, the author might have a duty to report it to prevent ongoing harm. Also, considering the mom's history of not taking responsibility, she might continue her behavior if not held accountable.\n\nSo, from a moral and legal perspective, the author might not be in the wrong for reporting their mom. The mom's actions are illegal, and the author is protecting their own interests and upholding the law. The past help from the mom is appreciated but doesn't excuse her current crimes. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
