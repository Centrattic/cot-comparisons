She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is considering turning in their mom because she opened a business in their name and seems to be doing some shady tax stuff. The mom has a history of lying, narcissism, and bipolar disorder. The author has a complicated relationship with her, living with her rent-free after a mental health crisis.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the mom used the author's name without permission to open a business, that's probably illegal. Identity theft or fraud could be involved here. The mom might be taking advantage of the author's identity, which could have serious legal consequences for the author if they aren't aware of the business's activities. So, from a legal standpoint, the mom is at fault for using someone else's identity without consent.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author is in a vulnerable position, having recently been through a mental health struggle and relying on their mom for housing. The mom's betrayal by telling others about the author's mental health issues, which led to a loss of trust, adds to the complexity. The mom's actions in opening the business without permission and using the author's name could be seen as exploiting their son's situation.\n\nBut the author is considering turning her in. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so. The author might feel that despite the mom's past help, the illegal activities and betrayal justify reporting her. On the other hand, some might argue that the author should handle this privately first, trying to resolve the issue without involving authorities, especially given the mom's mental health issues.\n\nHowever, if the mom's actions are indeed illegal, the author has a responsibility to protect themselves. Reporting the mom might be necessary to prevent further harm, both legally and financially for the author. The mom's history of not taking responsibility and the author's lack of trust in her make it less likely that a private resolution would work.\n\nSo, considering the mom's wrongdoing and the potential legal repercussions for the author if they don't act, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting her. The mom's actions are the main issue here, and the author is trying to protect themselves.\n"
