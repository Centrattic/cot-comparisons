She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The person has been living with her rent-free after struggling with depression. They trusted her with a private mental health issue, but she told everyone, leading to a breach of trust. Now, the mom started a business in their name and might be doing some shady tax stuff. The author is torn between reporting her and the fact that the mom provided a place to stay.\n\nI need to consider legal, ethical, and emotional aspects. Legally, if the mom is engaging in fraudulent or illegal activities using the author's name, the author might have a duty to report it to protect themselves from liability. The business in their name could lead to legal issues for the author if the mom is caught. Ethically, the mom's actions are clearly harmful and manipulative, especially considering her history of betrayal. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their own interests and legal standing. However, there's also the aspect of gratitude for the shelter provided. But if the mom's actions are illegal and could harm the author, the moral obligation might be to report her despite the past kindness. \n\nIt's a tough call, but the mom's actions are self-serving and potentially harmful. The author's decision to report her would be a matter of self-preservation and legal responsibility rather than being in the wrong. So I think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
