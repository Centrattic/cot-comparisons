She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. They've had a strained relationship with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, was hospitalized, and then lived with their mom after. They trusted her with their personal information, but she betrayed that trust by telling everyone. The mom then didn't apologize sincerely but gave a passive-aggressive response. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name, which might involve tax issues and lack proper insurance. The author is torn between reporting her and the fact that the mom provided support when they needed it.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mom's past behavior\u2014lying, not apologizing, and now potential illegal business activities. The author is considering reporting her despite the mom's help. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nMoral and ethical considerations come into play. On one hand, the mom did help the author when they were in a vulnerable state. On the other, the mom might be committing fraud or other crimes by misusing the author's name and not following tax laws. The author's duty to report illegal activities versus their personal relationship.\n\nLegally, if someone is running a business under another person's name without their consent, that's identity theft and fraud. The author might be a victim here, so reporting could be their right. Ethically, is it right to report someone who helped you in need? But the mom's actions were unethical in using the author's identity and not following the law.\n\nThe author's mom's behavior has been manipulative and dishonest, which complicates the relationship. The author might feel conflicted because of the mom's help in the past, but the current situation involves potential crimes. The author isn't in the wrong for considering reporting the mom, especially since the mom's actions are illegal and the author's consent wasn't given for the business. The author isn't responsible for the mom's past issues; they're protecting themselves and possibly others from the mom's fraudulent activities.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
