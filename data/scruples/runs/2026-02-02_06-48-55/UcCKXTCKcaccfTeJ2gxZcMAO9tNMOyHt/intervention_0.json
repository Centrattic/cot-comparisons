She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The author was struggling with depression, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom. The mom then told everyone, which the author found out about and confronted her. The mom didn't take responsibility and gave a weak apology. Now, the mom opened a business in the author's name and is doing shady tax stuff.\n\nSo, the author is torn between reporting their mom for her illegal activities vs. the emotional conflict of betraying her after she helped them. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legality. If the mom used the author's name without permission to open a business, that's identity theft, which is illegal. The tax issues and lack of insurance are also illegal. The author might be a victim here. But the author is considering turning her in, which could lead to legal consequences for the mom. \n\nBut the author is conflicted because their mom helped them during a vulnerable time. However, the mom's actions were harmful (spreading private info, not taking responsibility, illegal activities). The author's duty might be to protect themselves legally and ethically, even if it's painful.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to consider if the author is at fault for wanting to report their mom. Since the mom committed illegal acts, the author isn't in the wrong for exposing them. Even though there's a personal relationship, the law should be above that. The author isn't responsible for the mom's actions but has a right to protect themselves and report crimes.\n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
