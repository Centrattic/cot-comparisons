She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The author has a complicated relationship with their mom, who's described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. They've had periods of not speaking. The author had mental health issues and admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward. Afterward, they told their mom, who then shared this information with others despite the author's request for confidentiality. The mom also took the author in, allowing them to live rent-free for six months. The author confronted the mom about breaking trust, but the mom blamed the author and offered a superficial apology.\n\nNow, the key issue: the mom opened a business in the author's name and possibly engaged in shady tax practices, like using the business account personally, not declaring overseas purchases, and lacking proper insurance. The author is considering turning her in but is conflicted due to her past support.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. Legally, if the mom used the author's name without permission for a business and committed tax fraud, that's illegal. The author might have a legal right to report her to prevent further fraud. However, ethically, there's a personal conflict. The mom helped the author during a vulnerable time, which adds emotional weight. \n\nThe author's mental health history and the mom's narcissistic traits complicate things. The mom's betrayal by sharing private info and now using the author's name might justify the action. But the author's gratitude for past help could be seen as a moral obligation not to report her. \n\nLegally, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting illegal activities. Ethically, it's more nuanced. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the mom's actions are criminal, the author isn't at fault for seeking justice. The initial act of the mom is the key here. The author isn't committing a crime by reporting; they're potentially stopping fraud. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, I need to make sure. The author is considering reporting the mom for her illegal actions, which would be the right thing to do regardless of past favors. The mom's past support doesn't absolve her of current crimes. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for doing the right legal and ethical thing.\n"
