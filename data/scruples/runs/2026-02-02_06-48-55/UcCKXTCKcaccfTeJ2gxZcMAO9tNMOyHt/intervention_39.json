She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar and a narcissist, and she's bipolar. The author has mental health issues and once admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward. They told their mom, who then told everyone, which the author is upset about. The mom didn't apologize sincerely. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name, and there are some shady practices involved, like tax issues and lack of insurance.\n\nThe author is torn between turning her in and the fact that the mom provided a place to live. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering this. \n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, if the mom is committing fraud or tax evasion by using the author's name without permission, then the author could be a victim. The author might be liable if they don't report it, especially since their name is being used. But the author is also in a personal relationship with their mom, which complicates things.\n\nOn one hand, the author's mom has betrayed them before, and the author's mental health is a factor. On the other hand, the author had a place to stay. But from a legal and ethical perspective, if someone is using your identity for illegal activities, it's generally expected that you would report it to protect yourself and prevent further harm. The mom's past behavior (lying, not apologizing) suggests she might not stop if not confronted. \n\nThe author's intention is to report the mom to stop the illegal activities, even though it's a family member. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their legal rights and preventing potential legal trouble for themselves. The mom's actions are the main issue here. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
