She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong if they turn their mom in. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the mom has mental health issues, is a compulsive liar and narcissist. The author has a strained relationship, with long periods of silence. The author had a mental breakdown and went to a psychiatric ward, told their mom, who then spread the information. The mom then opened a business in the author's name and seems to be doing shady things with taxes and insurance.\n\nThe author is torn between gratitude for the mom's support (living with her rent-free) and the mom's dishonesty and potential illegal activities. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for turning her in.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The mom used the author's name without permission for a business. If that business has tax evasion or false insurance issues, that's illegal. The author is being asked if they're in the wrong for reporting their mom. Legally, if the mom is committing fraud or tax evasion, the author is not in the wrong for reporting it. The author isn't the one breaking the law. The mom is. The author's past relationship issues don't make them responsible for her crimes. The fact that the mom might have mental health issues doesn't excuse her actions. The author has a moral obligation to prevent illegal activities, even if it's a family member. Also, the author's own trust issues with the mom (lying, betrayal) support the decision to report her. So the answer should be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
