She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is strained, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, told their mom about it, and moved in with her. The mom broke the trust by sharing the author's private information, leading to a confrontation where the mom didn't apologize sincerely. Now, the author found out the mom started a business in their name with possible tax and insurance issues.\n\nThe key points here are: the mom's past behavior includes betrayal and lack of accountability. The author is considering reporting her for illegal activities. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLegal-wise, if the mom is committing crimes (tax fraud, using business funds for personal use, no proper insurance), the author might have a duty to report. But there's also the emotional aspect of their strained relationship. The author feels grateful for the support during their mental health struggle but is conflicted because of the mom's past actions.\n\nHowever, the author isn't necessarily at fault for seeking justice against illegal activities, especially since the mom has a history of dishonesty and self-centered behavior. The author's decision to report could be seen as necessary to prevent further harm, even if it's difficult. On the other hand, considering the personal history, there's empathy for the author's dilemma.\n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report illegal actions. The mom's actions are the primary issue here. The author's gratitude doesn't obligate them to ignore potential crimes. So the answer is likely B (No).\n"
