She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is considering turning in their mom due to her using their name for a business and engaging in shady practices. They have a complicated history\u2014mom is a liar, narcissist, bipolar, and has breached trust before.\n\nFirst, the mom opened a business in the author's name without permission. That's a serious legal issue. Using someone's identity without consent for business purposes is illegal. Plus, the mom is doing things like mixing business and personal finances, not reporting purchases, and lacking proper insurance. These are all potential legal violations, like tax evasion or fraud.\n\nThe author has mental health issues and admitted this to their mom, who then spread it around. The mom isn't showing genuine remorse, which adds to the tension. The author is living with her rent-free, but feels betrayed again with the business matter.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning her in. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLegally, if the mom used the author's name without permission and committed fraud, the author has a right to report it. They aren't necessarily in the wrong for exposing illegal activities. However, there's the personal aspect\u2014mom did help them when they were struggling. But the author's duty to report crimes might outweigh past kindness. Also, the mom's previous behavior (lying, betrayal) might make the author more inclined to act in self-protection.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report their mom for illegal activities. The answer should be B (No).\n"
