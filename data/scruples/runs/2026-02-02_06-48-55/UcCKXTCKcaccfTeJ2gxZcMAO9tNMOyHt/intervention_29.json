She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is complicated.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The author had mental health issues and admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward. They told their mom, who then told everyone, leading to a confrontation. The mom didn't apologize sincerely. Now, the mom opened a business in the author's name with possible illegal activities like tax issues and lack of proper insurance.\n\nThe author is conflicted because their mom has helped them by letting them live rent-free, but the mom's actions might be illegal. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but others might see it differently. \n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical angles. Legally, if the mom is committing fraud or other crimes using the author's identity, the author might have a duty to report it to protect themselves and prevent further harm. However, there's the personal aspect of their strained relationship and the mom's betrayal. \n\nIf the author is being used without their consent, that's a serious issue. The mom could be facing legal consequences, which the author might have to accept as a necessary step. On the other hand, the author might feel guilt for betraying the mom despite her past actions. \n\nBut from a legal standpoint, the author isn't at fault for reporting illegal activities. The mom's actions are separate from their personal relationship. The author isn't responsible for the mom's choices, so turning her in could be a moral duty to prevent ongoing illegal behavior. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report the mom's illegal activities. The answer should be B (No).\n"
