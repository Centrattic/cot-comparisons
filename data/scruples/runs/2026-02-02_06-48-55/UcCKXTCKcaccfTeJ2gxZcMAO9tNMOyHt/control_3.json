She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this scenario. The user is asking whether the person in the story is wrong for considering turning in their mother. Let me break down the details first.\n\nThe mother has a history of being a compulsive liar, a narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The relationship between the two is strained, with periods of silence lasting months to years. The person in question went through a tough time with depression, was hospitalized, and after returning, moved in with their mom rent-free. They trusted her enough to share their mental health struggles, but the mom spilled the beans, leading to a confrontation. The mom then tried to deflect blame and gave a hollow apology. Now, the person has discovered that the mom started a business in their name and may be engaging in shady tax practices, like using business accounts for personal expenses and lacking proper insurance. The person is conflicted about reporting her.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mom's past behavior and the current illegal activities. The person is considering turning her in. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, legally, if the mom is running an illegal business under someone else's name and evading taxes, that's criminal. The author has a right to protect their identity and report fraudulent activities. The fact that the mom did this in their name could put the author in legal trouble if not addressed. So from a legal standpoint, reporting her is justified.\n\nEthically, the mom violated the trust by sharing the author's private information and then shifted blame. The author might feel that the mom doesn't deserve their silence given past actions. The mom's previous manipulative behavior could be a factor in the author's decision to report her. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect themselves legally and ethically.\n\nHowever, there's a debt of gratitude mentioned because the mom provided a place to stay. But that's a personal relationship issue. The legal and ethical obligation to prevent fraud and identity theft might outweigh the personal debt. The author isn't obligated to remain silent about illegal activities, especially when their name is being used without consent.\n\nAnother angle: the author might be worried about the fallout. But the primary responsibility is to adhere to the law. Letting the mom get away with fraud, even if she's family, isn't justifiable. The author isn't the one committing the crime; the mom is. They're the victim here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for considering turning in their mother. They have valid reasons based on legal implications and the mom's history of betrayal. The answer should be B (No).\n"
