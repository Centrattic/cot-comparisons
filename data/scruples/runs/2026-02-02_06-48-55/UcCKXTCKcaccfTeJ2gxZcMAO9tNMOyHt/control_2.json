She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation involves the mom being a compulsive liar, narcissist, and having bipolar disorder. She told others about the author's mental health, which was a breach of trust. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with some questionable practices.\n\nFirst, the mom's actions: she violated the author's trust by sharing private information and is now potentially engaging in illegal business activities. The author feels torn between gratitude for the support during their depression and the betrayal and illegal actions. \n\nThe key points here are the mom's breach of confidentiality, the unauthorized use of the author's name, and the possible illegal business practices. The author is considering reporting her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nEthically, if someone is using another person's identity for a business without their consent, that's illegal and unethical. The mom's actions could lead to legal consequences for the author if the business isn't properly registered in her name. Also, the mom's past behavior (lying, not apologizing sincerely) might indicate a pattern of self-serving actions.\n\nThe author's dilemma is between loyalty to family and taking a stand against illegal activity. Legally, the author might have grounds to report the mom, especially if they were not involved in starting the business. Emotionally, the author has a history of mental health struggles and a strained relationship with their mom. \n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect themselves legally and morally. The mom's actions are the primary issue here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
