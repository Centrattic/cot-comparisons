She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the mom has mental health issues: bipolar, narcissistic, and a compulsive liar. Their relationship is rocky, with periods of not talking. The person had a mental health crisis and admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, then told their mom, who then spread the information. The mom didn't take responsibility and gave a half-hearted apology. Now, the mom opened a business in the person's name with possible tax issues and other shady practices.\n\nThe person is conflicted because the mom provided a place to live rent-free after their mental health episode. They want to know if turning her in is wrong. \n\nFrom the mom's side, she's using her child's identity for business, which is illegal. The person isn't in the wrong for exposing illegal actions. Even though the mom helped them live rent-free, that doesn't justify illegal activities. The person is protecting themselves and others from her actions. Also, the mom's betrayal of trust by spreading the mental health info shows she's not trustworthy. \n\nSo, the person isn't in the wrong for turning her in. They're addressing a legal and ethical issue. The mom's actions have consequences beyond just their personal relationship. The person is prioritizing the law and their own well-being over past favors. Answer should be B.\n"
