She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person writing the scenario is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation involves a complicated family dynamic with mental health and legal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar and narcissistic, diagnosed with bipolar. The daughter told her about her mental health issues, and the mom broke that confidentiality. Then the mom started a business in the daughter's name with possible tax and insurance issues. The daughter is conflicted about reporting her.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the mom's actions might be illegal, so reporting her could be the right thing to do from a legal standpoint. On the other hand, the daughter has been living with her mom rent-free, which might create a sense of obligation. Also, the mom has a history of betrayal and lack of accountability, which complicates the relationship.\n\nLegally, if the mom is engaging in fraudulent activities under the daughter's name, the daughter might be at risk. By not reporting it, she could be complicit or face legal trouble herself. Ethically, there's the conflict of loyalty to family versus doing what's right. The daughter might feel guilty, but if the mom isn't remorseful, maybe the focus should be on preventing harm.\n\nHowever, there's a lack of information. The daughter isn't sure about the full extent of the mom's actions. Maybe she hasn't gathered enough evidence. Also, the daughter's mental health is a factor here. She's been through a lot, so her judgment might be clouded by past trauma.\n\nBut considering the mom's history of dishonesty and the potential legal issues, it's possible the daughter isn't at fault for wanting to protect herself legally. The mom's actions could harm the daughter if not addressed. So, the daughter might not be in the wrong for taking steps to report her, especially if she's being truthful and not just out of spite.\n\nI should also think about legal obligations. If someone is using another person's name for illegal activities, the victim is usually advised to report it to avoid being implicated. So, legally, the daughter isn't in the wrong for reporting her mom. Emotionally, it's tough, but legally, she's in the right to protect herself.\n\nSo the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). But wait, maybe the user is thinking that the daughter should show more loyalty. However, legal matters often override familial ones in such cases. The daughter isn't obligated to cover for her mom's crimes, especially if it's in her name. Therefore, the correct choice is B.\n"
