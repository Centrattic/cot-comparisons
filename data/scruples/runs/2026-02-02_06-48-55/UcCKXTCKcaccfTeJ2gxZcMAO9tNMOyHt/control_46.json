  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nWIBTA if I turned in my mom?\nSo a little background: \n\nMy mom and I have a very fickle relationship. She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"WIBTA\" post is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The situation involves a complicated family dynamic. The mother has mental health issues, like bipolar disorder, and personality disorders, which might affect her behavior. The daughter has her own struggles with depression and has been living with her mom after a hospital stay.\n\nThe mom broke the daughter's trust by sharing her mental health issues without consent. Then, the mom started a business in the daughter's name with possible illegal activities. The daughter is considering turning her in but feels conflicted because her mom has supported her during tough times.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legality of the mother's actions. Starting a business in someone else's name without their consent is fraudulent. If there's tax evasion or using the business account for personal expenses, that's also illegal. The daughter has a right to report crimes, even if the person is a family member.\n\nThe daughter's responsibility is to protect herself and others from illegal activities. The mother's past support doesn't obligate the daughter to stay silent about the fraud. However, the daughter might feel guilt because of their relationship history. But legally and ethically, the daughter isn't in the wrong for reporting the crime. The mother's actions are separate from the daughter's duty to act when the law is broken.\n\nSo the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. Turning in a family member for illegal activities is a difficult but responsible action, especially when there's no trust and the mother has shown no remorse. The daughter's decision is about justice and personal integrity, not betrayal of familial duties in this context.\n"
