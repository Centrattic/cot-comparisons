She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's mom is a compulsive liar and a narcissist with bipolar disorder. The author had a mental health episode, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom. The mom then spread the information, leading to a confrontation where the mom didn't really apologize sincerely. Now, the mom has opened a business in the author's name and is doing shady things like tax evasion and not having proper insurance. The author is considering turning her in but is conflicted because the mom provided a place to stay rent-free.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the mom is using the author's name without permission and engaging in illegal activities, that's fraud. The author's name is being misused, which can lead to serious legal consequences for the author if the business is found to be illegal. The mom's actions could be considered identity theft or business fraud. In that case, the author has a right to report this, especially if they weren't involved and are a victim. \n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author is dealing with a parent who has a history of betrayal and manipulation. The mom's actions have already broken trust, and the author has a right to protect their own name and legal standing. Even though the mom has supported the author in the past, that doesn't mean the author has to ignore illegal activities. The mom's past support doesn't justify her current fraudulent behavior.\n\nHowever, there's a potential conflict of interest here. The author is living with their mom and has a complicated relationship. Reporting the mom might have personal consequences, like losing their home or worsening the relationship. But legally, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting crimes committed against them. They have a responsibility to protect themselves from the legal repercussions of the mom's actions. \n\nThe author's decision to report the mom isn't about revenge but about preventing further harm and legal issues. The mom's failure to apologize or take responsibility in the past shows a pattern of manipulation, which the author has every right to address. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for turning in their mom for fraudulent activities. They have a right to protect their identity and legal standing, regardless of the past support. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
