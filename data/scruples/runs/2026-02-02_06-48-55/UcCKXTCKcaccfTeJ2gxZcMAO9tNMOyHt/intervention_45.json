She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. Let me break this down. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The author admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward and told their mom, trusting her not to spread it, but the mom did tell everyone. The author then confronted her, but she didn't apologize sincerely. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with possible tax issues and other illegal activities.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong to consider reporting her. The author is worried about being in the wrong despite the mom's past behavior. On one hand, the mom did help the author by letting them live rent-free. On the other, she committed fraud by using the author's name and engaging in illegal business practices. The author is torn between gratitude and the need to report wrongdoing.\n\nLegally, if someone uses another person's identity to start a business and commit tax fraud, that's a crime. The author has a right to protect their identity and report illegal activities. However, the moral aspect is complex due to their personal history. The mom's past betrayal and lack of genuine remorse might justify the author's decision to report her. But the user initially thought the author was in the wrong, so maybe they're considering the loyalty aspect. But legally and ethically, allowing illegal activities to continue, even against a family member, might not be acceptable. The author isn't just turning her in out of spite but to prevent further harm and protect their own interests. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
