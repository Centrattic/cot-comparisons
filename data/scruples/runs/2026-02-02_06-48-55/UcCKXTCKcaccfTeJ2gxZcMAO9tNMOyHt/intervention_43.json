She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex. The mom has mental health issues\u2014bipolar, narcissistic, and is a compulsive liar. The author had a mental health crisis, checked into a psychiatric ward, and told their mom, who then shared that information with others, which is a big breach of trust. The author moved in with her rent-free and seems grateful but is now finding out the mom started a business in their name and might be doing some tax evasion or other shady financial stuff.\n\nFirst, the mom's actions of opening a business in the author's name without permission\u2014that's definitely a legal issue. Using a business account for personal expenses and not declaring purchases could be illegal. The author is considering turning her in because of that. But they feel conflicted because their mom supported them during a vulnerable time. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if that's correct. So I need to evaluate the moral and legal aspects here. Legally, if the mom used the author's name without authorization, she might be committing fraud or identity theft, which the author has a right to report. But morally, the author is dealing with a difficult family situation and feels indebted. However, the mom's pattern of behavior includes betrayal and not being trustworthy. The author's decision to report her is about protecting themselves from legal liability and preventing further harm, not just revenge. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're not breaking any laws, and they're acting in self-defense against their mom's actions. The mom's past support doesn't obligate the author to cover up illegal activities. But some might argue that the author should handle it privately to avoid legal repercussions for their mom, especially if she has mental health issues. However, the mom's actions are deliberate and could be criminal, so the author isn't wrong for wanting to stop that. The answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
