She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong if they decide to turn in their mom. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as having some serious issues: compulsive lying, narcissism, bipolar disorder. They've had a complicated relationship with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, told their mom, who broke confidentiality by telling others. Then, the mom started a business in the author's name, which might involve tax evasion or other shady practices. The author is considering reporting her, even though the mom has provided some support in the past.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if the mom is committing fraud or other crimes by using the author's name without permission, the author might have a legal right to report her. But ethically, there's a conflict because the mom has helped the author during a vulnerable time.\n\nOn one hand, the mom's actions could be illegal, which would make reporting her a civic duty. On the other hand, the author might feel conflicted about betraying someone who has been a caretaker. However, the mom's history of betrayal (like sharing the author's private medical information) might justify the author's decision. The mom's refusal to apologize sincerely adds to the tension here.\n\nThe key points are: Did the mom act illegally? If so, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting her. Also, the mom's prior behavior (breaking confidentiality) might make the author's decision more about protecting themselves rather than betrayal. The author is torn between gratitude and the need to report misconduct. \n\nLegal obligations might outweigh personal relationships in cases of fraud. The author isn't the one committing the crime; the mom is. So, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting her, especially if the mom's actions are illegal. The past support doesn't absolve the mom of legal wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
