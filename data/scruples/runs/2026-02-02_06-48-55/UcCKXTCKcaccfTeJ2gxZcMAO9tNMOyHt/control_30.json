She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The context is complex. The mom is described as having mental health issues and a history of lying and betrayal. The author admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, told their mom, and she broke that confidence. Then she opened a business in the author's name with possible illegal activities.\n\nFirst, the mom's actions are definitely problematic. She violated the author's trust by spreading their mental health issues and now is using their name for a business with shady practices. The author is considering reporting her, which is a serious decision.\n\nBut the author is also living with the mom rent-free, which they're grateful for. They might feel conflicted about betraying the mom after she's provided housing. However, the mom's actions could lead to legal trouble for the author if the business is indeed fraudulent. The author might be protecting their own legal standing by reporting the mom, which is a responsible action.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the mom is committing potential fraud and tax evasion, which are criminal activities, the author has a duty to report it to prevent further harm. Even though they've had a strained relationship, the author isn't responsible for the mom's actions. The mom's past behavior doesn't justify her current illegal activities. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting the mom. The answer should be B.\n"
