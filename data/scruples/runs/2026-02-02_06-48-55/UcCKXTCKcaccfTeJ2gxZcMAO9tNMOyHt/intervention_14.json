She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether they should turn in their mom for illegal activities. The author has a complicated relationship with their mom, who's been diagnosed with narcissism and bipolar disorder. She's lied a lot and breached trust, like sharing the author's private information about their mental health.\n\nNow, the mom opened a business in the author's name and there are tax and insurance issues. The author is considering turning her in but feels conflicted because their mom provided a place to stay when they were struggling. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if they do report her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. Using someone's name without permission for a business is identity theft, which is illegal. The mom's actions could be fraudulent, so reporting her might be the right legal step. The author's well-being is also a factor. They were in a mental health crisis and living with their mom, but she violated their trust and didn't take responsibility. The author might feel they have a duty to protect themselves and others by reporting illegal activities.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom provided support during a difficult time. The author is grateful but also hurt. They might feel torn between loyalty and doing what's right. However, the mom's actions are criminal, so reporting her isn't just about the relationship but about legal compliance. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for protecting themselves and others from fraud. The mom's past behavior (lying, betrayal) also suggests she's unlikely to change, so the author might be justified in taking action despite their history.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for turning her in. They're addressing illegal actions that could harm others if left unchecked. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
