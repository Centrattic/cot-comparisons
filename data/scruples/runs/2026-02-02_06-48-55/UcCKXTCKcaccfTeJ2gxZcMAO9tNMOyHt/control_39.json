She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person's mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. They have a strained relationship, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis and went to a psychiatric ward, then told their mom. The mom spread the information, leading to a confrontation where the mom didn't apologize sincerely. The author is now living with the mom, rent-free, but just found out the mom opened a business in the author's name and is doing shady things with taxes and insurance.\n\nThe key points here are the mom's actions (lying, betrayal, possible illegal business practices) and the author's dilemma about reporting her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for turning her in.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. If the mom is committing tax fraud or not having proper insurance, that's illegal. The author might be a victim since the business is under their name without consent. By turning her in, the author could be protecting themselves legally from being associated with the fraud. On the other hand, the mom has helped the author during a tough time, but the author might feel that the mom's actions are harmful.\n\nThe mom's lack of remorse and the author's trust issues are also factors. The author isn't in the wrong if they report illegal activities, especially when they're being used without consent. The moral obligation to report crimes might outweigh the personal relationship. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
