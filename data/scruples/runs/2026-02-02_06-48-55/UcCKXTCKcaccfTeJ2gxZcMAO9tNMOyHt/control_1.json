She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they decide to turn in their mom. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The author admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward and told their mom, who then broke their confidentiality by telling everyone. The mom also started a business in the author's name with questionable practices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the mom used the author's name without permission for a business and there are tax or insurance issues, that could be fraudulent or illegal. The author might have a legal right to report this. However, there's also the emotional and ethical angle. The author is living with their mom rent-free, which complicates things. But the mom's actions of opening a business in someone else's name without consent is a serious issue.\n\nThe author's mom's behavior seems malicious, especially given her history of not showing remorse. The author's decision to report might be driven by self-preservation and protecting their identity. On the other hand, there's a possible debt of gratitude from living with her. But given the mom's betrayal of trust regarding the psychiatric admission, it's clear that trust is already broken. \n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting illegal activities done under their name. Ethically, they might feel conflicted due to past support, but the mom's actions here are a separate issue. The author has the right to protect their legal identity and prevent fraud. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
