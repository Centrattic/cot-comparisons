She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the background: The author has a complicated relationship with their mother. The mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. They\u2019ve had periods of not speaking. The author struggled with depression, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom about it. The mom then told others, which the author confronted her about, and she gave a non-sincere apology. Now, the mom opened a business in the author's name, which seems to have some legal issues like tax evasion, using business accounts for personal expenses, and lacking proper insurance.\n\nThe author is torn between turning her in and the fact that she provided them with a place to stay rent-free when they were struggling. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for turning her in.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, if the mom is committing crimes under the author's name, the author might be implicated. Even if the author didn't know, using their name without consent could be identity theft. So, the author has a right to report it to protect their legal standing. Ethically, the mom has a history of betrayal, lying, and not taking responsibility. The author might feel that turning her in is the right thing despite past help.\n\nBut there's also the emotional angle. The author is grateful for the support they received. However, the mom's actions are illegal and could harm the author if not addressed. The mom's betrayal in the past (talking about the author's mental health) shows a pattern of not respecting the author's wishes, which could be part of her narcissistic tendencies.\n\nThe key points here are the legal implications of the mom's business and the ethical dilemma of reporting someone who helped you. Legally, the author should report to avoid being associated with illegal activities. Ethically, considering the mom's history of betrayal and lack of accountability, the author's decision might be justified. The author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting themselves from potential legal issues and addressing the mom's deceitful actions. The past help is acknowledged, but the mom's current actions require intervention.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're taking responsibility for their own legal safety and addressing their mom's unethical behavior.\n"
