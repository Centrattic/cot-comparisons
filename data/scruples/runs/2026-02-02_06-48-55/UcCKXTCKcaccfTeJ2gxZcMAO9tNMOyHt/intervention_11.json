She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The situation is pretty complex. The person has a complicated relationship with their mother, who has mental health issues and personality disorders. The mom broke confidentiality about their mental health hospitalization and started a business in the person's name with potential legal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The mom used the person's name without consent for her business. That's a serious legal issue. Even if the person is grateful for shelter, using someone's identity without permission is a crime, possibly identity theft or fraud. The mom's actions could lead to legal consequences for the person if the business is found to be operating improperly. \n\nThe person is considering reporting their mom, which is a difficult decision. They might feel conflicted because their mom provided housing, but the legal wrong is there. Legally, the mom is the one at fault for using someone else's identity and possibly committing tax fraud. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The person isn't stealing or lying; they're reporting a crime. The mom's actions are the primary issue here. Even with the history of a strained relationship, the act of using someone's name for business without consent is a separate matter. The person is in a tough spot, but reporting a crime is a right, not a wrongdoing. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because they're reporting a legal violation. The mom's actions are the problem, and the person has a responsibility to protect themselves, even if it means involving authorities.\n"
