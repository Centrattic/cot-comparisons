She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they turn their mom in for opening a business in their name and engaging in shady tax practices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar and narcissist, diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Their relationship has been strained with periods of no contact. The user had a mental health crisis, told their mom, and then the mom spread that information, leading to a betrayal. Now, the mom started a business under the user's name with questionable practices.\n\nThe core issue here is whether the user is in the wrong for reporting their mom. Legally, if the mom committed tax fraud or other illegal activities, the user isn't obligated to protect her just because she's their parent. Especially since the mom used the user's name without consent, which could have legal repercussions for the user. The mom's actions could expose the user to liability, so turning her in could be a way to protect themselves.\n\nEmotionally, the user feels conflicted because their mom provided a place to stay. However, the user mentions being grateful but also highlights the mom's lack of genuine remorse and manipulative behavior. The mom has a history of breaking trust, so the user's decision might be more about self-preservation than betrayal.\n\nLegally, the user might not be in the wrong because they are reporting a crime. Ethically, it's a tough spot, but given the mom's actions, especially using the user's identity without consent, the user has a right to report her to protect themselves and prevent further harm.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
