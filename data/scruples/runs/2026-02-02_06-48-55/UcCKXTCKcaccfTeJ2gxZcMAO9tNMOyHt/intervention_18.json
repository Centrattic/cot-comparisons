She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mom is described as a narcissist, compulsive liar, and has bipolar disorder. There's a history of a strained relationship with periods of silence. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, told their mom, and moved in with her. The mom, however, broke the author's confidentiality by telling others about the hospitalization. When confronted, the mom didn't sincerely apologize and instead shifted blame. Now, the mom opened a business in the author's name with possible tax and legal issues.\n\nThe author is torn between reporting their mom for these illegal activities despite the mom providing them shelter and support. The core question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom.\n\nI need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the mom is engaging in fraudulent activities using the author's identity, the author might be at risk if they don't report it. However, the author might be complicit if they knew about the business and didn't act. On the other hand, the mother's betrayal and the author's vulnerable situation complicate the moral side.\n\nThe author's dilemma is between loyalty to family and doing what's right legally. The mom's actions (breaching confidentiality, lying, using the author's name) could put the author in legal trouble if the business is shady. By not reporting, the author might be enabling the mom's illegal activities.\n\nBut the author has a history of being manipulated and not trusted by their mom. The mom's lack of accountability is a red flag. Legally, the author has a responsibility to report fraud and identity theft, even if the person is a family member. Ethically, it's about protecting oneself from legal repercussions and stopping the mom's harmful behavior.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong for reporting the mom, as it's about legal compliance and self-protection. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
