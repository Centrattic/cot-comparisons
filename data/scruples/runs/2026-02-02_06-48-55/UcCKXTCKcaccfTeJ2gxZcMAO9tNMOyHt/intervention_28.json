She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the person is considering turning their mom in because she opened a business in their name and might be doing tax stuff illegally. The mom is described as a compulsive liar and narcissist with bipolar disorder. They have a complicated relationship, with periods of not speaking and living together.\n\nFirst, the mom told others about the author's psychiatric stay without permission. That's a breach of trust. Then, the author found out the mom started a business under their name. Using someone's name without consent for a business is definitely illegal and unethical. If the mom didn't get the author's permission, that's a major issue. Plus, the shady tax stuff and lack of proper insurance could lead to legal problems for both the mom and the author.\n\nThe author is conflicted because their mom has helped them during a tough time. But the mom's actions\u2014lying, betraying trust, and now possibly committing fraud\u2014seem to be serious. The author might be worried about the consequences of reporting her, like legal issues or family fallout. But from a legal standpoint, using someone's identity without consent and committing tax fraud are crimes. The author has a right to protect themselves and report illegal activities.\n\nHowever, there's also the emotional angle. The mom's mental health issues might play a role here. But the author isn't responsible for the mom's actions. The mom's behavior seems to be malicious or at least negligent. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect their identity and stop illegal activities. They are victims here, so turning in the mom isn't about revenge but about stopping harm.\n\nI think the key points are the unauthorized use of the author's name and the illegal activities. The author isn't at fault for reporting these. Even with the complex relationship, the legal and ethical issues here support the author's decision to report. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
