She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible For Admitting...) post is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is volatile, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, was hospitalized, and then moved in with their mom. They asked their mom not to tell anyone about their hospitalization, but the mom did. The author confronted her, and the mom gave a dismissive apology. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name and is possibly doing shady tax stuff.\n\nThe key points here are the mom's actions\u2014starting a business in someone else's name without consent and potential tax fraud. Those are illegal activities. The author is considering reporting her, which is a legal action. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so, despite the mom's past help.\n\nThe author's dilemma is between their gratitude for the mom's support and the mom's unethical/legal actions. Legally, using someone's identity for business without permission is a crime. The author isn't directly benefiting from the business; the mom is. So the author's intent to report her would be to prevent further illegal acts and protect their identity. \n\nThe mother's character is mentioned\u2014narcissistic, manipulative, not sincere. The author's trust is broken, and the mom's actions are harmful. Even though the mom has been helpful in the past, the legal and ethical implications of her current actions are significant. The author isn't taking revenge; they're addressing a legal wrong.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting their mom if the allegations are true. The answer should be B (No).\n"
