She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong if they report their mom for starting a business in their name and possibly doing shady things.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The mom is described as a compulsive liar and narcissist, with bipolar disorder. The author had mental health issues and moved back with her. They told her about their psychiatric stay, which she then spread around. The author confronted her, but she blamed them and gave a non-apology. Now, the mom started a business under the author's name, possibly with tax issues and lack of proper insurance.\n\nThe author is torn between reporting her and the fact that the mom provided a place to live rent-free. The question is whether the author is wrong to turn her in.\n\nSo, the key factors here are: the mom's actions (using the author's name fraudulently, tax evasion, etc.) and the author's potential moral obligation versus self-preservation.\n\nLegally, if someone uses another person's identity without consent, that's identity theft, which is a crime. So reporting her could be the right thing to do. However, the author feels conflicted because the mom helped them when they were struggling.\n\nBut the mom's behavior has been consistently harmful\u2014lying, betraying trust, manipulating. The author might be protecting their own interests by reporting her, especially if they're being used in a fraudulent business. The mom isn't taking responsibility for her actions, so the author isn't in the wrong for seeking justice or protecting themselves from legal trouble.\n\nAlso, the mother's use of the author's name could lead to legal consequences for the author if the business is found to be illegal. So reporting her might be necessary to avoid being implicated.\n\nEthically, it's a tough call, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to protect themselves from a parent who hasn't respected their boundaries or well-being. The mother's actions are more blameworthy, and the author's decision to report her is about self-preservation and stopping further harm.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They're justified in taking action to protect themselves and address the fraudulent activities.\n"
