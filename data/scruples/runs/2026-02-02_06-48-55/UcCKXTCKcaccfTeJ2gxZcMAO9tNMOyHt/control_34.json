She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they turn in their mom for starting a business in their name and possibly doing shady things. The mom has a history of lying, narcissism, and bipolar disorder. The author lives with her rent-free after a mental health crisis and asked her not to tell anyone about their hospitalization, but she did. \n\nFirst, the legal aspect: using someone else's name to start a business is identity theft, which is illegal. Plus, tax evasion and lack of insurance are also illegal. So, if the author has evidence, they might have a legal right to report her. But the author is torn because their mom helped them when they were struggling.\n\nMoral-wise, it's more complicated. The mom has a history of betrayal, doesn't apologize sincerely, and the author doesn't trust her. The author might feel justified in reporting her due to the harm caused by her lies and possible illegal activities. On the other hand, the author is grateful for the shelter and support.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they report their mom, is that their fault? The mom's actions are the root here. The author is trying to protect themselves and maybe prevent further harm. The mom's actions are unethical and illegal, so the author isn't necessarily wrong for seeking to hold her accountable. The mom's past behavior (lying, betrayal) shows a pattern of self-centeredness, which might make the author's decision more about self-preservation than wrongdoing.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to address their mom's illegal actions, which could affect others too, like customers or tax authorities. The mom's responsibility for her actions is key here.\n"
