She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The situation is complex. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. She was told about her daughter's psychiatric hospitalization, which she then shared with everyone, violating the daughter's trust. The daughter confronts her, but the mom blames the daughter and offers a fake apology. Now, the mom started a business in the daughter's name, possibly doing shady tax stuff and lacking proper insurance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the mom used the daughter's name for a business without permission, that's identity theft or fraud. Those are legal offenses. The daughter has the right to report that. But the question is whether she's in the wrong for doing so, considering their complicated relationship and the mom's past behavior.\n\nOn one hand, the mom has a history of betrayal and manipulation. If she's engaging in illegal activities under the daughter's name, that's a serious issue. The daughter's mental health struggles might make her more vulnerable, but she's aware of the situation and making a choice now. Legally, she's not obligated to protect her mother from consequences for her actions. Reporting her would be a responsible action to prevent further harm.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the daughter should handle it privately, maybe through legal means without involving authorities. But if the mom's actions are illegal, then the right course is to report them. The daughter isn't necessarily in the wrong for seeking justice for the misuse of her identity, especially since her mom has shown no remorse and a pattern of harmful behavior.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. The key here is the illegality of the mom's actions. The daughter isn't the one committing the crimes; she's the victim. Reporting it is a legitimate response to protect herself and prevent her mother from continuing harmful activities. Therefore, the daughter isn't in the wrong for turning her in.\n"
