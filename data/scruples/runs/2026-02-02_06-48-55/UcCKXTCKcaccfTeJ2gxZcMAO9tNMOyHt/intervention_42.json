She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is complicated, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis and was hospitalized. They told their mom about this, trusting her a bit, but she ended up telling everyone, which caused a breach of trust. The mom gave a non-apology, which the author found insincere.\n\nNow, the mom started a business in the author's name six months ago. There are allegations that the business has tax issues, uses the business account for personal expenses, doesn't declare purchases properly, and lacks proper insurance. The author is conflicted about reporting her because the mom has supported them during their recovery.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mom's unethical business practices and the author's dilemma. Legally, if the mom committed tax fraud or other legal violations by using the author's name, then the author might have a duty to report it. But there's also the personal aspect of the mom's past support. However, the mom's trustworthiness is questionable given her history of lying and betrayal. \n\nThe author is concerned about being in the wrong for reporting her. But if the mom is indeed committing crimes, then the author might have a moral obligation to report her, even if it's hard. The mom's actions in the past (betrayal, lying) might reduce the author's responsibility, as they're protecting themselves from further harm. Also, the mom used the author's name without consent, which is a separate legal issue. \n\nOn the other hand, there's the question of the author's gratitude for the support during their recovery. But if the mom's actions are illegal, the author might prioritize the law over personal gratitude. Plus, the mom's lack of genuine remorse suggests she might not care about the author's feelings, making the author's decision less about being \"wrong\" and more about self-protection and legal duty.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting their mom. The mom's actions are the main issue here, and the author is trying to do the right thing despite the complicated relationship. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
