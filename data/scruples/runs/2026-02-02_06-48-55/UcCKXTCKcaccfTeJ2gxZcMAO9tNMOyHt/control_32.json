She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for considering turning their mom in. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The author had mental health issues and was hospitalized, then moved in with their mom. They trusted her to keep their hospitalization private, but she told everyone. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with possible tax and legal issues.\n\nFirst, the mom's actions: using the author's name without permission for a business, which is a legal issue. If the author is the legal owner or if the mom misrepresented the business, that's fraud. Also, the mom's past behavior\u2014lying, betrayal, not taking responsibility\u2014shows a pattern of manipulation and self-centeredness.\n\nThe author's dilemma is about whether to report their mom. They're grateful for support during a tough time but feel betrayed. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to report her.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the mom used the author's identity without consent, the author is not in the wrong for exposing that. The mom's actions are illegal, regardless of their past. The author's decision to turn her in could be seen as protecting their identity and legal rights, which is justified. The mom's betrayal doesn't negate the author's right to act in their own interest. The author isn't responsible for the mom's actions, so they aren't in the wrong for taking steps to address fraud and identity theft. The mom's past behavior doesn't absolve her of current crimes, so the author turning her in is a valid response to protect themselves.\n"
