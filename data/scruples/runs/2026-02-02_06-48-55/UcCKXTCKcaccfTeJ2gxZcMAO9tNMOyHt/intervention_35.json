She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The relationship is strained, with periods of silence. The person in the question had mental health issues and admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward. They told their mom about this and moved back in with her. She promised not to tell anyone but did, leading to a confrontation. Now, the mom opened a business in their name and might be doing shady things with taxes and insurance.\n\nThe person is torn about reporting her. They feel grateful for her support but are also hurt by her betrayal. The main question is whether reporting her is morally wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the mom used the child's name without permission for a business, which could be illegal. Tax evasion and lack of insurance are serious issues. Reporting her might be the right legal and ethical thing to do, protecting the child's identity and preventing potential harm from her actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the person has a history of being helped by their mom, even if the relationship is toxic. They might feel conflicted about betraying her, especially given her personality traits. The mom's past behavior (lying, narcissism) might indicate a pattern of self-serving actions, which could justify the person's decision to report her to protect themselves and others.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. If someone is being harmed or their identity is misused, taking action could be necessary. However, if the person is acting out of self-interest or revenge, it might be wrong. The key points are the legal aspects and the moral obligation to stop illegal activities versus the emotional ties and past support.\n\nIn this case, the mom's actions could lead to legal consequences for the child if the business is in their name. By not reporting her, the child might be complicit in her illegal activities. Therefore, reporting might be the responsible choice. The fact that the mom has shown no genuine remorse in the past also suggests that changing her behavior is unlikely, so the child's action could prevent future issues.\n\nSo, considering all this, the person might not be in the wrong for reporting their mom, as it's about protecting their interests and preventing illegal activities. Hence, the answer would be B.\n"
