She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author has a troubled relationship with her, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, told their mom about it, and then moved in with her. The mom then told everyone about the author's mental health issue, which the author found untrustworthy. When confronted, the mom didn't apologize sincerely. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with possible tax and insurance issues.\n\nThe author is torn between their gratitude for living arrangements and the betrayal and possible legal issues. The question is whether the author is in the wrong to consider turning in their mom.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the mom did use the author's name without permission, which is definitely illegal. Using someone's identity for business purposes and not claiming purchases, improper insurance could be tax evasion or fraud. The author has a right to report this as it's a legal matter. On the other hand, the author has been living with the mom, perhaps rent-free, and might feel indebted. However, the mom's actions in exposing the author's mental health history and the lack of sincere apology show a pattern of betrayal and lack of empathy.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's intent is justified. Since the mom committed illegal acts using the author's name, the author is within their rights to report her. The author isn't the one who broke the law here; the mom did. The author's decision to report would be a responsible action to address the legal issues, regardless of their past relationship. The user's dilemma is about whether they should act on their own legal rights despite the personal history. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect their identity and ensure legal compliance. The mom's actions are the problematic ones here, so the author isn't at fault for considering reporting her.\n"
