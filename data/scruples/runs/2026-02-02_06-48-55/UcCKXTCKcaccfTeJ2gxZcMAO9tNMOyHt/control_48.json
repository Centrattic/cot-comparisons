She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they turn in their mom for various reasons. The situation is complex. The mom is described as a compulsive liar and a narcissist with bipolar disorder. She betrayed the author by sharing their private information about a psychiatric stay and now opened a business in the author's name with potentially illegal activities.\n\nFirst, the author is struggling with their own mental health, which adds context to their decision. The mom's actions have been harmful: breaking the author's trust by disclosing their mental health, and now possibly involving them in illegal business activities. The author is considering reporting their mom, which is a serious action.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the mom is indeed engaging in fraudulent or illegal activities under the author's name, the author might be implicated. Turning her in could be a way to protect themselves legally. However, the author has been living with her and is grateful for her support, which complicates the moral aspect. \n\nThe mom's behavior is consistently manipulative and unapologetic, as she didn't take responsibility for her actions. The author is trying to break free from a toxic relationship. Legally, the author might not be in the wrong if they report the mom to prevent further illegal activities, especially if they weren't involved in the business. Ethically, it's a tough call, but since the mom acted without consent and potentially used the author's identity, the author might have a duty to themselves to take action. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for protecting their own interests and legal standing. The answer is B.\n"
