She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The key points here are the mom's actions versus the author's decision.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as having mental health issues and a personality disorder. She's a compulsive liar and narcissist. She breached the author's trust by disclosing their mental health without permission. Then, she started a business under the author's name, which involves shady tax practices and lack of proper insurance. The author is considering reporting her but feels conflicted due to past support.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author's potential report is justified. The mom's actions, especially starting a business under someone else's name without consent and engaging in possible illegal activities, are serious. The author's duty to report fraud or illegal activities might outweigh their personal relationship. However, the author might feel guilty because their mom provided housing. But the mom's betrayal and deceit seem to have already damaged trust. Legally, the author isn't responsible for their mom's actions, so reporting her isn't about being in the wrong. Ethically, the author is protecting themselves and possibly preventing further harm. So, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
