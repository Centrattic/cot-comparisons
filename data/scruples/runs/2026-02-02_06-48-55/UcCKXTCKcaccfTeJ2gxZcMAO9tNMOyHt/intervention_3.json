She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (author) is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The situation involves the mom using the author's name to start a business, engaging in possibly illegal activities like tax evasion and using business funds for personal expenses, and not having proper insurance. The author is struggling with their mom's betrayal in the past and now this new issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. Legally, if the mom used the author's name without consent for a business and committed fraudulent acts, the author might have a right to report her. The mom could be facing legal consequences, and the author isn't necessarily complicit unless they knew and participated. The author might be protecting themselves from liability if the mom's actions are illegal. \n\nEthically, the author is conflicted because their mom provided support in the past. But the mom has a history of lying and narcissistic behavior, which complicates the relationship. The author might feel it's necessary to take a stand against the wrongdoing, despite the personal history. \n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is open to another perspective. I should evaluate if the author's actions are justified. Since the mom's actions are legally questionable and the author was a victim of misuse (using their name for fraudulent purposes), reporting her could be a responsible action. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for seeking accountability, especially if they were unaware of the fraud and didn't consent. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the strained relationship. The author might feel guilty, but legally, they are not responsible for their mom's actions. The key here is distinguishing between personal feelings and legal/ethical obligations. Reporting the mom could be the right thing to do to prevent further harm and legal issues, regardless of the past. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are acting in their own interest and the law's to prevent fraud and misuse.\n"
