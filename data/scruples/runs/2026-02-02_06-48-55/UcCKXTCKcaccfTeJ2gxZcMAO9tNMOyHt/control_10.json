She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author is considering turning in their mom, who they describe as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The mom told people about the author's mental health issue without permission, and now the mom has started a business in the author's name with possible shady tax practices and lack of proper insurance.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault here. The key points are: the mom broke confidentiality by sharing the author's mental health history, the author confronted her and she was dismissive, and now the mom is involved in potentially illegal business activities under the author's name. \n\nThe author is considering reporting her, which is a legal action. The question is about moral or legal wrongness. Legally, the mom might be doing something illegal by using the author's name and engaging in tax evasion. If the author reports her, they might be doing the right thing legally. But the author is worried about the mother's past support. However, the mom also violated trust by sharing private information.\n\nEthically, if someone is committing fraud or tax evasion, reporting them is generally considered the right thing to do, especially if the person is being used without consent. The author's mental health and the mom's betrayal of trust add complexity. The author isn't at fault for wanting to protect themselves from legal issues caused by the mom's actions. Also, since the mom has a pattern of narcissistic behavior and not apologizing sincerely, the author's decision to report her could be justified to prevent further harm.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they are trying to rectify a situation where they were wronged and to stop illegal activities. The answer should be B (No).\n"
