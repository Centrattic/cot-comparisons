She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The scenario is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The author has a strained relationship with her, having had periods of not speaking. The author admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward and told only their mom. The mom then told everyone, leading to a confrontation. The mom's response was defensive. Now, the mom opened a business in the author's name, which might involve tax evasion, using the business account for personal expenses, and lack of proper insurance. The author is considering turning her in despite her past support.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for reporting their mom. The question is about moral or legal rightness. Legally, if the mom committed crimes, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting them. Morally, it's trickier because of their personal relationship and the mom's previous actions, like betraying the author's trust. However, the author isn't obligated to protect someone from their own illegal activities, even if they live together. The mom's actions could have significant legal consequences, and the author might have a duty to report it if they know about it. The fact that the mom lied and was untrustworthy in the past might mitigate any guilt the author feels. On the flip side, the author might feel conflicted due to gratitude for past support. But legally and ethically, reporting a crime isn't wrong regardless of personal history. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
