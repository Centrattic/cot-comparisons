She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as a compulsive liar and narcissist with bipolar disorder. Their relationship is rocky, with long periods of not speaking. The person had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom, who then started a business in their name without permission. The mom also broke confidentiality by telling others about the psychiatric stay and didn't apologize sincerely.\n\nThe person is now considering reporting the mom for the business activities, which seem shady (tax issues, using business account for personal expenses, lack of insurance). They're torn because the mom helped them live rent-free after their breakdown.\n\nSo, the question is whether turning in the mom is wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the mom's actions in starting a business without consent and potential illegal activities could be a legal issue. The author might have a duty to report such wrongdoing. On the other hand, the mom did help the author during a vulnerable time, and the relationship is already strained. The author might feel conflicted about betraying someone who provided support, even if the mom's behavior was problematic.\n\nHowever, the key points are that the mom violated the author's trust by disclosing private information and now is engaging in possibly illegal business practices. The author's decision to report her could be seen as a responsible action to prevent further harm, even if the mom isn't a model parent. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect themselves and others from potential legal issues caused by the mom's actions. The mom's past support doesn't absolve her of current illegal activities. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for considering reporting her.\n"
