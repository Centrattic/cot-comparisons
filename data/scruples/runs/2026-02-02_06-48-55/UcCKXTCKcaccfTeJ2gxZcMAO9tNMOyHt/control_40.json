She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation involves a complicated family dynamic.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author has a history of mental health issues and admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward. After that, they moved back in with their mom, who they trusted minimally. The mom broke the trust by telling others about the author's admission, which the author found out and confronted. The mom didn't take responsibility and gave a non-apology. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with potential legal issues like tax evasion and lack of proper insurance.\n\nThe author is torn about turning her in despite her help. The key points here are: the mom committed a legal wrong by using the author's name without consent, possibly engaging in fraudulent activities. The author is considering reporting her. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, using someone's identity without permission is a crime. The author is not in the wrong for reporting illegal activities, regardless of their past relationship. The mom's actions are what's problematic here. Even though the mom helped the author, that doesn't justify her legal violations. The author is protecting their identity and preventing further harm by taking action. Also, the mom's lack of remorse and past betrayal make the situation more complex, but the legal aspect is separate from the emotional one. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
