She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the background: the mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is rocky, with long periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told only their mom. They moved back in with her, living rent-free, which they're grateful for. But then the mom told everyone about the author's mental health, which the author had asked her not to do. The mom didn't apologize sincerely and even tried to deflect blame onto the author. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with possible tax and insurance issues.\n\nSo, the key points here. The mom is using the author's name without permission, which is illegal. Starting a business in someone else's name without their consent is fraud. Also, the mom is engaging in tax evasion and other shady practices, which are crimes. The author is considering reporting her for these actions.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). The author is considering turning in their mom for illegal activities. The question is whether they're in the wrong for doing that.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a complicated relationship with their mom. The mom has been a caregiver, provided a place to stay, but violated the author's trust by sharing their mental health issues. The author might feel conflicted between gratitude and the need to report the legal violations.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's actions\u2014using someone's identity for a business, tax fraud\u2014are illegal regardless of the relationship. The author isn't committing a crime by reporting these actions, even if the person is a family member. The author isn't being wrong for upholding the law. The mom's past actions (lying, betrayal) don't absolve her of current crimes.\n\nAlso, the author's gratitude for the shelter doesn't obligate them to ignore illegal activities. Morally, there's no obligation to let someone commit crimes, even if they helped you in the past. The law doesn't work that way; you can't forgive illegal actions just because of personal history.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for considering reporting their mom for illegal activities. They have a duty to report crimes, especially when they involve fraud and tax evasion, which can have broader societal impacts. The author's own mental health struggles might make the decision harder, but it doesn't make the action wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
