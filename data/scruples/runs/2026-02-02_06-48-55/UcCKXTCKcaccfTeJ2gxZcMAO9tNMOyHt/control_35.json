She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if they'd be in the wrong if they turned in their mom. Their mom is described as a compulsive liar and narcissist, also has bipolar disorder. There's a history of not speaking for years. \n\nThe user admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward and told their mom, who then told everyone. They confronted her about the betrayal, and she didn't take responsibility, just said it was their fault and gave a fake apology. Now, the mom started a business in the user's name and has been doing shady things like not claiming purchases, using business account for personal, no proper insurance.\n\nSo the user is considering turning her in. Are they in the wrong? Well, the mom's actions are illegal. Using someone's name without permission for a business is fraud. Also, tax evasion and not having proper insurance are crimes. The user is concerned about their mom's actions, but they've had a rocky relationship. \n\nThe user might feel conflicted because their mom provided shelter, but that doesn't mean they have to protect her from legal consequences. The mom's betrayal and lies have already caused trust issues. The user might be trying to take responsibility for their own situation, not wanting to let past bad actions from their mom continue. \n\nSo turning her in could be a way to prevent harm to others if the business is illegitimate. Also, the user might not be responsible for their mom's actions. Even if they're related, the law is about illegal acts, not family ties. \n\nTherefore, the user isn't in the wrong for reporting their mom. They might be protecting themselves and others from her fraudulent behavior. The answer would be B, No.\n"
