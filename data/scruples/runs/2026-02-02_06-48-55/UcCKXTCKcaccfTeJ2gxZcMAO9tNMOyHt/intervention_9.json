She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mom has a complicated relationship with her child. She's described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. They've had periods where they don't speak for months or years. The author had a mental health crisis, was admitted to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom about it. Then, the mom broke the trust by sharing that information with others. The author confronted her, and the mom didn't sincerely apologize, just gave a dismissive one. The author is now finding out that the mom started a business in their name and may be doing shady things with taxes and insurance.\n\nThe main question is whether turning her in is wrong. The author is conflicted because the mom helped them during a tough time, but there's also betrayal and potential illegal activities.\n\nI need to consider ethics and legality. If the mom is indeed committing tax fraud or other illegal activities by using the author's name and not properly handling insurance, then the author has a duty to report it to authorities. However, the mom did open the business in the author's name, which could be a legal issue if the author didn't consent. So, the author might have legal standing to report the fraud.\n\nOn the emotional side, the mom's actions have been hurtful, but the author is conflicted about reciprocating by turning her in. However, the mom's actions (lying, betrayal, possible legal violations) might outweigh the gratitude for the help. The author might be justified in reporting illegal activities, especially if they didn't consent to the business being opened in their name.\n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. The author could first confront the mom about the business and see if they can resolve it without involving authorities. However, given the mom's history of not taking responsibility, it's possible that this won't work. In that case, reporting might be necessary to prevent further harm or legal issues.\n\nLegally, if the mom used the author's identity without permission for a business, that's identity theft. The author has a right to report that. Additionally, tax fraud is a serious offense. So, in terms of the law, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting. Ethically, it's more nuanced because of the personal history, but given the mom's pattern of behavior and potential legal violations, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The mom's actions might have crossed into illegal territory, making it the author's responsibility to come forward.\n"
