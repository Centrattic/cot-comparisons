She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author had mental health issues and admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward. They told their mom, who then told everyone, which the author found out and confronted her about. The mom didn't apologize sincerely. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with tax issues and other shady stuff. The author is torn between reporting her or not because the mom provided a place to stay.\n\nHmm. First, the mom's actions: using someone else's name for a business is illegal. Identity theft maybe? Also, tax evasion and not having proper insurance are criminal or at least unethical. The author is considering reporting her, which is the right thing legally. But they feel conflicted because the mom helped them when they were struggling.\n\nBut the mom's behavior has been problematic. She broke confidentiality, which is a betrayal. The author's mental health is a factor here. They might feel obligated to protect their mom because she helped them, but the mom's actions are harmful. Legally, the author is not responsible for their mom's actions, so reporting her shouldn't be considered wrong. However, the author might feel guilty because of their past relationship.\n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong for turning her in. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Since the mom is the one doing the illegal stuff, the author is acting in the right by reporting her. The author isn't at fault here. So the answer should be B.\n"
