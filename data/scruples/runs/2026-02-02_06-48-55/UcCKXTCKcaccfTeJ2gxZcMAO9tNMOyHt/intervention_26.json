She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: the mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is on and off. The person had a mental health crisis, told their mom about it, and moved in with her. They asked her not to tell anyone, but she did. Then the mom started a business in their name, which might be illegal\u2014like tax issues, using business funds as personal, and not having proper insurance.\n\nThe person is torn between turning her in and the fact that the mom has been housing them rent-free during their crisis. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know if I agree.\n\nHmm. Legally, if the mom used the author's name without consent for a business with fraudulent activities, that's a problem. The author might have the right to report it. But morally, considering their history and the mom's past behavior, it's a tough call. The mom has a history of betrayal, but she also provided support. \n\nThe key points: The mom broke the author's trust by disclosing their mental health. Then she used the author's name for a potentially illegal business. If the author is a victim of identity fraud, they might have a legal obligation to report it. However, the author feels grateful for the housing. But gratitude shouldn't override legal matters, especially if the mom is harming others or breaking the law. \n\nThe mom's actions could affect the author's credit, legal standing, etc., so turning her in might be necessary to protect themselves. Plus, the mom's pattern of lying and not taking responsibility suggests she might not stop if not held accountable. \n\nBut the user is arguing the author is in the wrong. Maybe they think the author should overlook the mom's actions because of the support provided. But if the mom's business is illegal, it's not just about the author's feelings\u2014it's about legal compliance and potential harm. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here. They have a right to protect themselves and report illegal activities, even if the person is their parent. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're acting in self-protection and upholding legal standards despite their personal relationship.\n"
