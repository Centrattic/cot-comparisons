She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar and a narcissist, with a bipolar diagnosis. Their relationship is strained, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told only their mom. They moved back in with her, living rent-free. The mom broke confidentiality by telling others, leading to a confrontation where the mom shifted blame onto the author.\n\nNow, the mom opened a business in the author's name and is engaging in tax evasion and other shady practices. The author is torn between reporting her and the fact that she provided a place to stay during a difficult time.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author do something wrong by considering turning in their mom? The question is not about what the mom did, but about the author's potential wrongdoing.\n\nThe author hasn't actually turned her in yet; they're just contemplating it. The mom's actions are clearly unethical and possibly illegal. The author is in a vulnerable position, having relied on their mom during a mental health crisis. The mom's betrayal of trust by disclosing the author's private information and now using their name for fraudulent business activities adds to the conflict.\n\nLegally, if the mom committed fraud by using the author's name without consent, the author might have a right to report it. However, the author might feel morally conflicted because their mom helped them when they were struggling. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning her in. \n\nIf the author reports their mom, they're acting to prevent illegal activities, which is their responsibility as a citizen. However, the emotional and moral dilemma is significant. But from a legal and ethical standpoint, not reporting known illegal activities could be seen as complicit. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report their mom for fraudulent actions, especially if they were used without consent. The mom's past behavior (lying, betrayal) might make the author's decision more about self-protection and upholding the law rather than betrayal.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are considering a responsible action to address illegal activities, even though it's a difficult personal situation.\n"
