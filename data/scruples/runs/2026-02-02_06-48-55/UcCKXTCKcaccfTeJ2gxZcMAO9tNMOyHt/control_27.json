She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation involves a complicated family dynamic with a mother who has mental health issues and a history of lying and betrayal.\n\nFirst, the mother has a history of being a compulsive liar and narcissist, which is mentioned. The author was struggling with depression and admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, then told their mom. The mom then broke confidentiality by telling everyone. The author confronted her, but she didn't sincerely apologize. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name and might be doing shady things tax-wise. The author is torn between reporting her and the fact that the mom provided housing during their recovery.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the mother's actions (lying, betrayal, illegal business practices) vs. the author's potential responsibility to report her. The question is about the author's moral wrongness. \n\nFrom a legal perspective, if the mom is actually committing illegal activities, the author might have an obligation to report them. But the author is also in a vulnerable position, having relied on their mom during a difficult time. However, the mom's past behavior suggests a lack of accountability and continued harmful actions. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect themselves and others from potential legal issues caused by the mom's actions. Plus, the mom's misuse of the author's identity is a serious issue. \n\nConsidering the mom's history of not taking responsibility and continuing to act in self-serving ways, the author's decision to report her could be seen as a necessary step to prevent further harm, even if it's difficult. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
