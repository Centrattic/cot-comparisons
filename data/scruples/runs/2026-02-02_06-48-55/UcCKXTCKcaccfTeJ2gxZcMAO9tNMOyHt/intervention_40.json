She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a complicated family relationship. The author's mom is described as a narcissist, liar, and has bipolar disorder. The mom started a business in the author's name, possibly doing shady things like tax issues and lacking proper insurance.\n\nThe author is torn between turning her in or not. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the mom's actions: starting a business in someone else's name without consent is definitely a legal issue. Using the author's identity could lead to legal problems for the author if things go wrong. The mom's other behaviors\u2014lying, betrayal, lack of accountability\u2014show a pattern of harmful behavior. The author did trust her once but was let down, which makes the situation more complex.\n\nNow, the author is considering turning her in. The user says the author is in the wrong. Why? Maybe because they're being ungrateful for the mom's help, or because they're taking revenge. But the mom's actions were unauthorized and potentially illegal. The author might be protecting themselves from future harm. \n\nLegally, allowing someone to use your identity for business can have consequences. The author might be liable if the mom's business practices lead to legal issues. Turning her in could prevent that. Ethically, is the author wrong for protecting their own interests? The mom's betrayal and lack of remorse make it hard to see the author as in the wrong. The author isn't the one who broke the law; the mom did. The author is seeking justice for their identity being used without consent.\n\nBut maybe there's a moral obligation to overlook it because the mom provided shelter. However, the mom's actions were illegal and could affect the author's future. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their legal standing and safety. The mom's past actions don't negate the current illegality. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their rights and protecting themselves from potential legal issues caused by the mom's actions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
