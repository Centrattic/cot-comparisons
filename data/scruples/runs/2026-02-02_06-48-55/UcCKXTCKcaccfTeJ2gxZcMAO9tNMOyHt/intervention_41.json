She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is considering turning in their mom after she opened a business in their name and possibly did some shady tax stuff. They have a complicated relationship\u2014mom is a liar, narcissist, bipolar, and breached trust by telling others about their mental health. \n\nFirst, the mom did something legally questionable: using someone else's name for a business, tax evasion, and insurance issues. That's a problem. But the person is struggling with whether to report her despite the mom's support during their hard times.\n\nOn one hand, reporting her might be the right thing if there's actual fraud or illegal activity. The mom's actions could have legal consequences. On the other hand, the person feels conflicted because of their history and the mom's past support.\n\nBut the key here is that the mom used the person's identity without consent, which is a legal issue. The person isn't wrong for wanting to protect their identity and hold the mom accountable for illegal acts. Even though the mom might have a history of poor behavior, the person's decision to report her is about legal and ethical responsibility, not just personal grievances. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to take that step, especially if the mom's actions are illegal. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
