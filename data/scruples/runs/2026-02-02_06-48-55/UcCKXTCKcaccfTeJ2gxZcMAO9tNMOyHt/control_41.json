She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mother. The situation is complex. The mother is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told their mom, who then spread the information. The author confronted their mom, but the mom didn't take responsibility. Now, the mom opened a business in the author's name with possible illegal activities.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons for considering reporting their mom are based on the mom's unethical and possibly illegal business practices. The mom's actions, like using the business account for personal expenses and not claiming purchases, could be tax fraud. The author's main concern here is the legality of the business, not just personal grievances. Even though the mom provided shelter, the author is facing a dilemma between gratitude and legal responsibility.\n\nThe key points here are whether the author has a moral obligation to report their mom despite the personal history. The author isn't doing this out of spite but because the mom's actions might be illegal. The mom's lack of remorse and the author's history of being betrayed make it a tough choice. Legally, if there's fraud or tax evasion, the author might have a duty to report, regardless of their personal relationship. However, the author might also consider the impact on their mom and their own mental health.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's intention is to act in the right by preventing illegal activities versus personal vendetta. Since the author is acting on legitimate legal concerns and the mom's actions are unethical, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The question is about the author's moral standing, not their emotional conflict. So the answer is B (No).\n"
