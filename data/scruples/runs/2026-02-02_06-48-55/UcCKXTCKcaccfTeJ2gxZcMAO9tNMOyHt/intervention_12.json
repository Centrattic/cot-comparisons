She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. They have a strained relationship with periods of silence. The author had a mental health crisis, checked into a psychiatric ward, and told their mom. They moved back in with her, living rent-free. The mom then told everyone about the author's mental health issue, which the author found a betrayal. When confronted, the mom didn't apologize sincerely, which the author points out as a pattern.\n\nNow, the mom started a business in the author's name, which has some shady practices\u2014like using business accounts for personal expenses, not reporting overseas purchases, and lacking proper insurance. The author is considering reporting her despite the help she provided over the years.\n\nSo, the question is: is the author in the wrong if they report their mom?\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the mom's actions are clearly unethical and possibly illegal. The author is being a victim of identity misuse and potential fraud. On the other hand, the author's mom did help them during a difficult time, so there's a conflict of gratitude versus justice.\n\nBut the mom's behavior is part of a pattern\u2014lying, not apologizing, manipulating. The business fraud is a separate issue. Legally, if someone uses another person's identity for business, that's a crime. The author has a right to report illegal activities, especially when they know the business is operating improperly. Even though the mom helped them, the fraud is a separate matter. The author isn't being ungrateful by reporting illegal actions; they're protecting themselves and preventing harm to others.\n\nBut the user might think the author is being ungrateful. However, the mom's actions in using the author's identity without consent and committing fraud are serious. The author's past relationship doesn't obligate them to stay silent about illegal activities. So, the author's decision isn't about spite but about correcting a wrong done to them. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for reporting their mom. The answer should be B (No).\n"
