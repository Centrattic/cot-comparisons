She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as having a narcissistic personality, being a compulsive liar, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is strained, with periods of not speaking. The author admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward and told their mom about it, asking her not to share. She did tell everyone, leading to a confrontation where she blamed the author for her actions. The mom also started a business in the author's name, which might have tax and legal issues.\n\nThe author is conflicted because the mom helped them by letting them live rent-free, but the mom's actions (like the business and the breach of trust) are problematic. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning her in.\n\nSo, considering the mom's actions: using the author's name without consent, potential tax fraud, and not having proper insurance. Those are serious legal issues. The author is being asked if they should report their mom despite her helping them live rent-free. \n\nOn one hand, the mom violated trust by sharing the author's private health info and is involved in illegal activities. On the other, the author is considering reporting her, which could lead to legal consequences for the mom. The author might feel conflicted because of the past support.\n\nBut the key here is that the mom's actions (starting a business in someone else's name, tax evasion) are illegal. Reporting her isn't just about revenge; it's about exposing illegal activities. The author is in a tough spot, but if the mom is breaking the law, the author isn't in the wrong for considering legal action. Especially since the mom has a history of manipulation and dishonesty. The author's well-being is also a factor, given their mental health struggles.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the author is addressing their mother's illegal actions, which could harm others or the author if they become liable. The mom's betrayal and prior actions reduce the moral obligation to protect her. The author's decision is more about justice and safety than spite, especially considering the mom's lack of remorse and the legal implications.\n"
