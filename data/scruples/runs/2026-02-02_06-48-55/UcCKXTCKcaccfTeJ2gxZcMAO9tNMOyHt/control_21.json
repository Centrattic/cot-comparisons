She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The user had mental health issues and moved in with their mom, who was supposed to keep their hospitalization private but didn't. Then the mom started a business in the user's name with possible tax and insurance issues. The user is conflicted about whether to report her.\n\nSo, the key points: the mom's actions could be illegal (tax evasion, using business account for personal use, lack of insurance). The user is considering turning her in. The question is if the user is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nLegally, if the mom's business activities are indeed illegal, then the user might have a legal obligation to report them, especially if they are being used without consent. However, there's a personal relationship aspect. The user is grateful for the mom's help during a difficult time, but the mom has betrayed trust before.\n\nBut the user didn't start the business; they were used without consent. The mom's actions could harm the user if discovered, so reporting might be in the user's interest to protect their own name. The mom's past behavior (lying, not apologizing) suggests she's not trustworthy. The user isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect themselves and report illegal activities. The mom's actions are the main issue here.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (not in the wrong). The user is protecting themselves from a parent who has a history of betrayal and is engaging in potentially illegal activities under the user's name. The user isn't at fault for exposing illegal actions, even if they have a difficult relationship.\n"
