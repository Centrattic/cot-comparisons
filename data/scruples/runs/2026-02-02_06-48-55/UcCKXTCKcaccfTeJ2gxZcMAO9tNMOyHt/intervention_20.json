She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're wrong for wanting to turn in their mom. Their mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The user told their mom about their psychiatric hospitalization, and she spilled the beans. Then the mom started a business in the user's name with possible tax issues and other shady stuff. The user is torn between reporting her and feeling grateful for her help.\n\nFirst, the mom opened a business under the user's name without permission. That's a legal issue. Using someone's identity without consent is a crime, possibly fraud. The mom might be liable for tax evasion and not having proper insurance, which could affect clients and the business's legitimacy. The user's health history adds context\u2014maybe the mom took advantage of their vulnerable state.\n\nBut there's also the emotional aspect. The mom has been a caregiver, providing a place to stay. The user might feel conflicted about reporting someone who helped them during a tough time. The mom's personality traits (narcissism, lying) make it hard to trust her intentions. She's already broken the user's trust before by revealing their private information and giving a non-sincere apology.\n\nLegally, the user isn't in the wrong for reporting a crime. The mom's actions\u2014using the user's name without consent, tax fraud, etc.\u2014are illegal regardless of their personal relationship. The user isn't responsible for the mom's actions. Even if they're grateful for past support, that doesn't mean they should ignore illegal behavior. The user's mental health struggle doesn't make them complicit in the mom's fraud. \n\nHowever, there's a moral dilemma. The user might feel guilt for betraying their mother, especially given their history. But from a legal standpoint, the user has a duty to report crimes, even if done by a family member. The mom's mental health diagnosis (bipolar) might explain some behavior but doesn't excuse criminal acts. The user's decision to report shouldn't be based on the mom's past kindness but on the legality of the situation.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't in the wrong for reporting their mom's illegal activities. They have a right to protect their identity and ensure justice. The moral complexity is there, but legally, they're justified.\n"
