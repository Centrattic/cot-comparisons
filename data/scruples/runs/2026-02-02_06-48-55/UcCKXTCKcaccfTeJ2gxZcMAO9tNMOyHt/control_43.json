She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author has a complicated relationship with their mother, who is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The mom violated the author's trust by spreading their mental health issues without permission. Then, the mom started a business in the author's name, which has questionable practices like tax evasion, using business accounts for personal expenses, and lacking proper insurance. The author is torn about reporting her due to the mom's past support.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legality. The mom used the author's name without consent for a business, which is a legal issue. Using someone's identity without permission can be identity theft. Additionally, the mom's business practices (like tax evasion) are illegal if proven. The author's responsibility here is about reporting illegal activities, which is a civic duty regardless of personal relationships.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The mom betrayed the author's trust by disclosing their mental health, which is a serious violation. The author is struggling with guilt because the mom provided financial support in the past. However, the mom's actions in starting the business and her past behavior (lying, narcissism) complicate this. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect themselves and others from potential harm caused by the mom's illegal activities.\n\nThe options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). Legally, the mom's actions are wrong, so reporting her isn't the author's fault. Ethically, the author is seeking justice and self-protection. The mother's past support doesn't obligate the author to cover up crimes. Therefore, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong for considering turning in their mom for illegal activities, especially after repeated trust violations.\n"
