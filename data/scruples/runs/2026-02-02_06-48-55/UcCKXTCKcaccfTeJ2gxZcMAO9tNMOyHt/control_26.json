She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The background is complicated. The mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The author had mental health issues and admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, told only their mom, and later moved in with her. The mom broke their trust by telling others, and now the author found out she started a business in their name with possible tax and legal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the mom used the author's name without permission and the business has illegal activities, then the author might be at risk legally if the mom is operating under their identity. Turning her in could be a way to protect themselves from liability. \n\nEthically, the author is in a tough spot. They've had a strained relationship, and the mom has a history of betrayal. The author might feel they're protecting themselves, but turning in a family member can be seen as harsh. However, the mom's actions could cause the author legal trouble, so the author might be justified in protecting their own interests.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key points here are: did the author act in bad faith, or were they protecting themselves from a parent who has already betrayed them? The mom's actions (using the author's name, shady business practices) are the main issues. If the author reports her, it's to prevent being implicated in illegal activities, which is a valid reason. The mom's betrayal and lack of accountability might make the author's decision understandable. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting themselves from legal consequences caused by their mother's actions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
