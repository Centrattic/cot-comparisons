She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The scenario involves a complicated relationship with a mother who has mental health issues and a history of betrayal. The key points here are the mother's actions: she lied about the author's psychiatric admission, opened a business in the author's name without permission, and possibly engaged in shady tax practices.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the ethical and legal aspects. The mother is using the author's name without consent for business, which is likely illegal. Fraud or identity theft could be involved here. Legally, the author might have a right to report this. But ethically, there's the consideration of the past help from the mother\u2014rent-free stay, support during a mental health crisis. However, the mother's history of betrayal and lack of remorse complicates this.\n\nThe user's conflict is between loyalty to family and doing what's right legally. The mother's actions could harm the author if the business is illegal. The author's main concern is whether they're in the wrong for reporting their mother. The question is whether the mother's past actions (helping during a crisis) outweigh the illegal activities now.\n\nI need to consider if the author has a duty to report crimes committed against them. Legally, you don't have to report crimes, especially if you're a family member. However, by staying silent, the author might be complicit in the fraud. Ethically, there's a dilemma between family loyalty and justice. But given the mother's lack of accountability, the author might feel justified in reporting her to protect themselves and prevent further harm.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer would be B (No) because the mother's actions are illegal and harmful, and the author isn't obligated to remain silent. Even though there's a history of support, the mother's current illegal activities and past betrayal tip the balance towards the author acting in their own interest and legal rights.\n"
