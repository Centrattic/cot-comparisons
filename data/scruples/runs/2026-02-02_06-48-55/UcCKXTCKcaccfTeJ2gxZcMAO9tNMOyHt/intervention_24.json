She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The author's mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. She's done some shady things like starting a business under the author's name, not paying taxes properly, and using the business account for personal stuff. The author is considering turning her in despite living with her and receiving support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If the mom is engaging in illegal activities, like tax evasion or not having proper insurance, then those are criminal offenses. Legally, the author might not be obligated to report her, but they could if they choose to. However, legally, there's no requirement to report family members unless there's harm to others. But if the author's name is being used without consent, that's a different issue.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author is in a complicated relationship with their mom. She's hurt them by breaking confidentiality and being unapologetic. The author might feel justified in wanting to protect themselves. However, the author is benefiting from living rent-free with her. That could complicate the situation. The mom's actions might be harmful, but the author's decision to report her could have negative consequences for both parties.\n\nEthically, it's a tough call. The author might feel that exposing the mom is the right thing to do, especially if the mom's actions are illegal. But the author also has a history of emotional turmoil and might be influenced by their negative feelings towards the mom. There's a risk that turning her in could be seen as a personal vendetta rather than a genuine attempt to stop illegal activity. On the other hand, if the author is being used without consent, that's a violation of their rights.\n\nAnother angle is the author's mental health history. They were in a psychiatric ward, which might affect their decision-making. But they are the ones deciding to report their mom, so that's a personal choice.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, reporting a family member is often viewed with some stigma, but if the actions are illegal, it's a responsibility to the legal system. However, the author might also consider if there's a way to resolve this without involving authorities, like legal action to reclaim their identity or business name.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they report their mom for legal violations, they might not be in the wrong. However, if they are doing it out of spite rather than to correct illegal behavior, then maybe they are. The key factors are the legality of the mom's actions and the author's motives. The scenario states that the mom opened a business in the author's name, which is potentially fraudulent. So, the author has a legitimate reason to address this. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they are protecting their identity and legal rights.\n"
