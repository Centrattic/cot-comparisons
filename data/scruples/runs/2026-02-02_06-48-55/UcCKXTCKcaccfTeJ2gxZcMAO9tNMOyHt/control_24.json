She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's mom is described as a compulsive liar, a narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is on-again, off-again, with long periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis two years ago and told their mom about it, asking her not to share. The mom broke that confidentiality, which the author confronted, but the mom responded defensively. The author now finds out the mom opened a business in their name and is doing shady things with taxes, using the business account personally, and not having proper insurance.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. Let's consider the ethical and legal aspects.\n\nLegally, if the mom is committing tax fraud or other illegal activities by using the author's name without their consent, the author might have a legal obligation to report it. Using someone's identity without permission is identity theft, which is a crime. If the mom is indeed running a business in the author's name and committing tax violations, the author could be implicated if they don't act, especially if they knew about it. By not reporting, they might be complicit. So legally, the author might not be in the wrong; they might have a duty to report illegal activities.\n\nEthically, it's more complicated. The mom has a history of betrayal and manipulation, which makes the author's decision more about protecting themselves and others from harm. The author has been living with their mom rent-free, which might add to their sense of obligation, but that doesn't outweigh the potential legal and ethical issues of the mom's actions. The mom's behavior (breaking confidentiality, lying, not taking responsibility) shows a pattern of self-centeredness and disregard for others' rights. The author's decision to report could be seen as a moral duty to prevent further harm, even if it means betraying personal trust or family ties.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should handle this privately first, like confronting the mom again or seeking legal advice to resolve the business issue without involving authorities. However, given the mom's history of not taking responsibility, the author might not trust that she would address it without external intervention. Also, if the business issues are ongoing and illegal, delaying could lead to more harm.\n\nAnother angle is the author's own mental health struggles. They might be under stress from this situation, and deciding to report could be a way to regain control or self-preservation. It's important to consider the author's well-being as well.\n\nIn summary, legally the author might have a responsibility to report illegal activities, especially since they involve their identity. Ethically, the mom's past actions and the potential harm from her current business practices support the author's decision. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
