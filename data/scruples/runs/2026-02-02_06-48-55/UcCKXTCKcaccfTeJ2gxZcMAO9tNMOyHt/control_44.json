She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mother. The context is a complicated family dynamic with a mother who has mental health issues and a history of betrayal. \n\nFirst, the mother has a personality disorder and bipolar diagnosis, which might affect her behavior. The author has a history of depression and was in a psychiatric ward. They moved back in with their mom, who then disclosed their private information, leading to a breakdown in trust.\n\nNow, the mother started a business in the author's name with potential illegal activities like tax evasion and lack of proper insurance. The author is conflicted about reporting her because their mom has provided support in the past.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the mother act illegally by using the author's name for a business with shady practices? If so, then the author might have a duty to report her. However, the author might feel conflicted due to their personal history. But from a legal standpoint, if the mother committed crimes using the author's identity, the author isn't at fault for reporting it. The mother's actions are her own, and the author isn't responsible for her wrongdoings. Also, the author's well-being and safety are important, especially after previous betrayals. Reporting her could prevent further harm. So, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to report her.\n"
