She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to turn in their mom. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mom is described as a compulsive liar, narcissist, and has bipolar disorder. The user has a complicated relationship with her, with periods of not speaking. The user had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, and told only their mom. They moved back in with her for six months. They trusted her with that sensitive information but she told everyone, which the user found hurtful. The mom denied responsibility and gave a non-apology. Now the user found out the mom opened a business in their name that might be operating illegally\u2014tax issues, using business accounts for personal stuff, lack of proper insurance.\n\nThe user is torn: should they turn in their mom despite her helping them during a tough time?\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong if they turn in their mom?\n\nLet me consider the moral and legal aspects. Legally, if the mom is committing fraud or tax evasion by using the user's name and not following regulations, then the user might have a duty to report it. The user isn't necessarily responsible for their mom's actions unless they were directly involved. However, the mom opened the business in the user's name, which could legally implicate the user. But if the user didn't know about it and didn't participate, then they might not be liable. However, if the user's name is on the business, they might be held accountable for the business's actions, so reporting could be necessary to protect themselves legally.\n\nMoral considerations: The user feels betrayed by the mom's actions\u2014spreading private information and then the business situation. The mom's lack of remorse and tendency to blame others might make the user feel justified in taking action. However, the user acknowledges the mom provided a place to stay during a hard time. So there's a conflict between justice (reporting illegal activities) and gratitude (owing the mom for help).\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If they report their mom, is that morally wrong? Well, if the mom is indeed committing crimes, then allowing the authorities to address it might be the right thing to do, even if it's a family member. However, there's also the need to consider if the user could address this with the mom first, possibly through legal means to remove their name from the business, and then decide whether to report. If the user hasn't tried to resolve it with the mom yet, maybe they should. But given that the mom has a history of not taking responsibility, the user might not trust that approach.\n\nAnother angle: turning someone in can be seen as a betrayal, but if it's to prevent further harm or illegal activities, it might be justified. The user might be in a difficult position where they feel morally right in protecting the law over family loyalty. On the other hand, some might argue that the user should exhaust other options first, like legal recourse to sever ties with the business, before involving authorities.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it depends on the perspective. Legally, the user might not be in the wrong if the mom committed crimes without the user's consent or knowledge. Morally, it's more complex. The user has a right to protect their identity and prevent misuse. The mom's actions could lead to legal consequences for the user if the business is found to be illegal. So, reporting might be necessary for self-preservation as well as upholding the law.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is acting to prevent harm (legal or otherwise) caused by their mom's actions, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if they are acting out of spite or without verifying the facts, that's different. The user mentions that they found out about the business and observed some shady practices, so there's some evidence to act on.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to report their mom if the mom's actions are illegal and the author is trying to prevent further harm or legal issues for themselves. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
