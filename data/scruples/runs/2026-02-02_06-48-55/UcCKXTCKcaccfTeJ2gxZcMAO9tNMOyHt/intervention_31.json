She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they report their mother for running a business under their name and doing shady financial things.\n\nFirst, the mother has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. The author confided in their mom about their mental health issues, but the mom betrayed their trust by telling others. The author moved in with her rent-free after their hospitalization, and now the mother opened a business in the author's name, possibly committing tax fraud and other illegal activities.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Did the mother act illegally? 2) Is the author responsible for that? 3) Is reporting her a betrayal given her past actions?\n\nLegally, if the mother used the author's name without consent for a business, that's identity theft and fraud. The author isn't responsible for their mother's actions unless they were complicit. Even if the mother provided financial support, that doesn't negate her illegal activities. The author might have a moral dilemma due to their strained relationship and past kindnesses, but legally and ethically, the mother is at fault. The author is protecting their own identity and preventing legal trouble by reporting her. So, the author isn't in the wrong for taking action against someone who has harmed them.\n"
