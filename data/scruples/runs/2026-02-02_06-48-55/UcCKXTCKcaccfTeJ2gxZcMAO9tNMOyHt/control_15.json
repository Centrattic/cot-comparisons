She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. She betrayed the author by telling others about their mental health issue, which she apologized for insincerely. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name with possible tax and legal issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The mom used her child's name without permission for a business, which is a legal issue. The author is concerned about the mom's shady practices. Legally, using someone's name without consent can be identity theft or fraud. The author is in a tough spot because their mom has helped them during a vulnerable time, but she's also done things that are harmful.\n\nThe author's main dilemma is whether they're wrong for reporting their mom. On one hand, the mom has been untrustworthy and harmful. On the other, the author is grateful for her help during their mental health crisis. But legally, the author isn't at fault. They're trying to prevent their name from being used for illegal activities, which protects their own interests and the public from potential harm caused by the mom's business practices.\n\nEthically, the author might feel conflicted due to family ties, but the mom's actions here are a separate legal issue. The fact that the mom has a history of betrayal doesn't absolve her of the current legal misconduct. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for reporting their mom. They have a right to protect their name and prevent illegal activities, even if it's a family member involved.\n\nAlso, the mom's past behavior (lying, betrayal) might explain why she did this, but it doesn't justify it. The author's responsibility here isn't about family loyalty but about legal and ethical standards. So, the answer is likely that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
