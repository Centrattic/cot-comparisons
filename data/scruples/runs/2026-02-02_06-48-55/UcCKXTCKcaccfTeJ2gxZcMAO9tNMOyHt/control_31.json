She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the user is considering turning in their mom. The mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is strained, with periods of not speaking. The user had a mental health crisis, was hospitalized, and told their mom. The mom then told everyone, which the user found out and confronted. The mom didn't apologize sincerely and even shifted blame onto the user.\n\nNow, the mom started a business in the user's name and is doing shady things like tax fraud and lack of insurance. The user is torn between gratitude for the past support and the desire to report her.\n\nI need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, if the mom used the user's name without permission and committed tax evasion or fraud, then the user might be implicated. By not reporting it, the user could be complicit, especially if they knew about it. But if they report, they might be seen as betraying their mom. However, legally, there's a duty to report fraud. Morally, it's tricky because the user is also a victim of the mom's past actions.\n\nThe user might feel conflicted because they're grateful for the help but also want to avoid legal trouble. However, the mom's actions could put the user in legal jeopardy if the business is fraudulent. By not reporting, the user might be enabling the mom's illegal activities. On the other hand, turning her in could be seen as the right legal step, despite the personal relationship.\n\nConsidering all this, the user isn't in the wrong for reporting the illegal activities. They have a responsibility to prevent fraud, especially if they're associated with it. The mom's past actions don't absolve the user from legal obligations. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
