She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong if they turn in their mom. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is strained, with periods of not speaking. The author had mental health issues and ended up in a psychiatric ward. After that, they told their mom, who then spread the information. The author confronted her, and she didn't apologize sincerely. Now, the mom started a business in the author's name, which might be illegal (shady taxes, using business account for personal stuff, no proper insurance).\n\nThe author is torn between turning her in or not. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the mom's actions. Using someone else's name for a business is a serious legal issue. Tax evasion and not having proper insurance could be illegal. The author is considering reporting her, which is a legal action. The mom's betrayal in the past might affect the author's feelings, but the legal wrongdoings are separate.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the mom is committing crimes under the author's name, the author might be legally liable. Even if they didn't know, they could be implicated. So reporting might be necessary to protect themselves legally. Alternatively, maybe the author could confront the mom to stop the illegal activities first. But if the mom is not cooperating and the author is a victim here, then reporting might be justified.\n\nBut the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Maybe they feel the author should be grateful for the support from their mom. However, the mom's actions are illegal, which is a separate matter. The author isn't at fault for the mom's actions. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong if they report their mom because it's about preventing illegal activities and protecting their own legal standing. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
