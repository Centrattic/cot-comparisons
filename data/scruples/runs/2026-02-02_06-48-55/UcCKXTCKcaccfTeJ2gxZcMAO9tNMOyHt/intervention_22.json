She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex. The mom is a compulsive liar and narcissist, diagnosed with bipolar. The author had a mental health crisis, admitted themselves to a psychiatric ward, told their mom, who then spread the information. The mom also opened a business in the author's name and did some shady tax stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. If the mom committed fraud or illegal activities using the author's name without permission, that's a serious matter. The author might be a victim here, as their identity was used without consent. Turning her in could protect the author from legal repercussions and prevent further harm. However, the author is also considering the mom's past support, like letting them live rent-free after the mental health crisis.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. The mom's actions are unethical and possibly illegal, which might justify the author reporting her. On the other hand, the author's history with their mom is tumultuous, and there's a possible conflict of interest. The author might be trying to cut ties or seek justice. Legally, the author has a responsibility to report crimes, especially if their name is being used fraudulently. Ethically, it's about protecting oneself and upholding the law. The mom's past actions (lying, betrayal) might make it harder for the author to trust her, but the decision to report should be based on the legality of the business activities.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they report their mom, especially since the mom's actions are harmful and illegal. The author's well-being is also a factor, considering their mental health struggles. The right answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
