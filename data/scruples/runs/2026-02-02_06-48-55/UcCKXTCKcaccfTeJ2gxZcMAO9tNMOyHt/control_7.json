She is a compulsive liar and full blown narcissist, as well as diagnosed bipolar. We have gone months to years not speaking multiple times. \n\nFor the past few years I've been struggling with depression. About 2 years ago, I voluntarily admitted myself to a psychiatric ward. After I got out, I only told one person, my mom. It's not because I trust her really, but because I didnt really care what she thought of me anymore. I told her that I needed a little help, and moved back in with her about 6 months later. I have been living here rent free, and I am very grateful for what she has done. \n\nAfter telling her about my visit I asked her not to tell anyone, and of course, she told everyone that would lend an ear. A few months ago I finally confronted her about it, telling her that was a shitty thing to do, and how I couldn't trust her after that. She said that I needed to take some responsibility for how it had affected her, basically saying that her betrayal was my fault, and gave me an \"I'm sorry you feel that way,\" type apology. I didn't respond because I realized it was futile, and that she will never be sorry for anything she's done. (Trying to illustrate the kind of person she is, I have never heard the word sorry come out of her mouth sincerely)\n\nToday, I found out she has opened a business in my name 6 months ago. From what I've seen, she seems like she does some shady stuff tax wise sometimes, using her business account like a personal one, not claiming things she purchased overseas on her taxes or at customs. She doesn't have the proper insurance for the services she offers either. I'm not sure of the full extent of things, but I know a few things are not done by the book. \n\nI am honestly torn. WIBTA if I turned her in, even after all she's done for me over the past couple of years?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering turning in their mom. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the mom has a history of being a compulsive liar, narcissistic, and has bipolar disorder. Their relationship is volatile, with periods of not speaking. The author had a mental health crisis, told their mom about it, who then shared it with everyone, breaking the author's trust. The mom also started a business in the author's name that seems to have legal and ethical issues. Now the author is considering reporting her, despite the mom's past support.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by doing this. Let's break it down. The mom violated trust by sharing the author's personal information, didn't apologize sincerely, and committed possible illegal activities under the author's name. The author is concerned about the moral dilemma here\u2014reporting someone who helped them, but who also did wrong.\n\nLegally, if the mom is engaging in fraudulent or illegal business practices, the author isn't necessarily obligated to cover for her, especially if she used the author's identity without consent. The mom's actions could have consequences for the author if the business is under their name. So from a legal standpoint, reporting might be the right thing to do to protect the author's identity and rectify the misuse.\n\nEthically, it's a tough call. The author is grateful for the past support, but the mom's actions have crossed into betrayal and potential criminal behavior. The mom didn't seek permission to use the author's name, and her past behavior suggests she doesn't respect boundaries or honesty. The author isn't obligated to stay silent about something that could harm them legally or financially.\n\nOn the other hand, family dynamics complicate things. The author might feel conflicted about betraying their mom, especially after she provided a place to stay. However, the mom's prior actions (spreading the author's personal information, lack of sincere apology) show a pattern of self-centered behavior, which might make the author's decision more justified.\n\nSo, considering the mom's actions and the potential legal implications, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to report her. It's about protecting themselves and holding someone accountable for misuse of their identity, especially when the person is known for dishonesty. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
