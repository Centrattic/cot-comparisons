They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband and wife trying to decide how to spend money on their children's education. The wife wants to send their biological daughter to a private school costing $15k a year, while the husband suggests also covering his two stepsons from a previous marriage. They can only afford one child's tuition, so the wife is upset that the husband brought up the idea to the stepson without consulting her and wants to prioritize their daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, the husband is responsible for his children from a previous marriage, so he might have an obligation to support their education. However, the wife isn't the legal parent of the stepsons, so she might not feel responsible. Emotionally, the wife has made a promise to her biological daughter, which adds a personal commitment angle.\n\nThe key points are financial responsibility and the emotional impact on the daughter. The husband brought up the idea to the stepson without the wife's knowledge, which might have caused her distress. The wife feels the husband is prioritizing the stepson over their daughter, but they can only afford one. The wife's plan is to set an ultimatum, making the husband responsible for breaking the news to the stepson since he initiated it.\n\nArguments for the wife being in the wrong (A) could be that the husband is trying to fulfill his parental duties towards all his children, and the wife is being selfish by not considering the stepsons. However, arguments against (B) might focus on the lack of prior discussion, the promise to the daughter, and the financial constraints. The husband's action of discussing the tuition with the stepson without the wife's input could be seen as a mistake, leading to the wife's justified frustration.\n\nConsidering the context, the wife's resentment is understandable. The husband's approach was careless, and the wife's priority on keeping a promise to her own child is valid. The financial reality makes it impossible to help all three, so the wife's stance seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong).\n"
