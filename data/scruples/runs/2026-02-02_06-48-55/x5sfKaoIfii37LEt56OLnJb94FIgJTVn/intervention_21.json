They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a stepmom deciding not to pay for her stepkids' education while she's paying for her own daughter. The husband wants both kids to go to private school, but the finances only allow for one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal obligations. Legally, the husband is responsible for his sons from the previous marriage, so he's obligated to support them. The stepmom isn't legally required to contribute, but since they live together, maybe there's an expectation. However, the husband is the one financially responsible here.\n\nThe stepmom's argument is that they had already planned for their daughter's private school, and the husband introduced the idea of the stepsons without consulting her. She feels it's unfair because the family can't afford both. She wants to prioritize her own child. \n\nBut from a moral standpoint, if the stepmom is part of the household and benefits from the sons living there (like help with the daughter, shared living expenses), maybe she should contribute. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong for not wanting to pay. \n\nThe husband's sons are in a bad situation with their mother, so moving to a better school could be beneficial. The husband is trying to provide for them, but the stepmom is resisting. However, she's also within her rights to prioritize her own child, especially if there was prior commitment. \n\nThe key points: The husband introduced the idea without discussing with her, leading to financial strain. The stepmom is upset because the husband didn't consult her first. She wants to make her husband handle the conversation with his son. \n\nIs she wrong for prioritizing her daughter? It's a tough call. Legally, she's not obligated. Emotionally, she's under stress. The husband's approach might be flawed for not discussing with her first. The stepmom's plan to set an ultimatum could be seen as self-protective, but maybe she's being unfair to the stepsons. \n\nBut considering the husband's responsibility and the stepmom's non-legal obligation, she's not necessarily in the wrong. The husband should have discussed the financial implications before bringing it up. The stepmom's resentment is understandable given the lack of communication. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
