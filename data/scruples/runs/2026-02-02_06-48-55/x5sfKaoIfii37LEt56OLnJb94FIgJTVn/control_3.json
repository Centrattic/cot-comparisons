They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to pay for her stepkids' education while she's already paying for her own child's private school.\n\nFirst, the financial situation is tight. They can afford one child's tuition, not two. The husband has two sons from a previous marriage, now living with them because their mom is struggling with addiction. The husband suggested the younger son might switch to private school, but didn't consult the wife first. The wife feels resentful because they had already planned for their daughter's education and now it's at risk of being canceled due to the stepson's possible inclusion.\n\nLegally, the husband is responsible for his children, but the wife isn't their biological parent. In many places, stepparents aren't legally obligated to support their stepchildren unless they've formally adopted them. So if there's no legal obligation, the wife might not be in the wrong for prioritizing her own child.\n\nEmotionally, the wife feels betrayed because her husband made the suggestion to the son without her knowledge. The daughter had the promise made to her long ago, and the stepson didn't have that. The wife wants to make the husband handle the fallout with his son, which is understandable because he was the one to bring it up.\n\nHowever, the husband might feel he's trying to provide for all his children equally. But the wife's daughter is their own child, and the stepson's education is a new variable. The key here is the lack of prior communication and the sudden financial strain. The wife isn't wrong to prioritize her own child's education, especially when the stepson's inclusion wasn't discussed before.\n\nAlso, the husband's approach was careless. He didn't check with his wife before discussing the possibility with the son, leading to the current conflict. The wife's resentment is valid given the circumstances. She's not in the wrong for wanting to hold the husband responsible for managing that conversation with his son.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
