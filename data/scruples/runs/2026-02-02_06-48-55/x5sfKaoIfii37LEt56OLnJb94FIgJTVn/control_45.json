They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a step-parent dealing with financial responsibilities for both their own child and their husband's children from a previous marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and her husband have a 7-year-old daughter. The husband has two sons (11 and 15) from a previous marriage, who are now living with them. The ex-wife is struggling with drug addiction. The author wants to send their daughter to a private school costing $15k a year. The husband suggested possibly paying for his younger son's schooling too, which the author is upset about because they can only afford one child's tuition. The author feels the husband is being unfair, prioritizing the stepson over their daughter. She's considering an ultimatum where their daughter's education is the priority.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's look at the responsibilities here. Legally, the husband is responsible for his sons from the previous marriage. However, the author is not the biological parent of the sons. The author might not have a legal obligation to support them financially beyond what the husband is required to do. The husband's sons live with them, so there's a possibility that the husband is expected to cover their expenses, including education. But the author is not the stepmother in a legal sense, so maybe she's not responsible for their education costs unless agreed otherwise.\n\nThe author made a promise to their daughter about private school. The husband then brought up the possibility of the son attending the same school without consulting the author. The author is frustrated because they can't afford both. The husband is trying to be fair between his two sons and their new daughter, but the author feels her daughter's future is being compromised.\n\nIt's a matter of priorities and financial responsibility. The author isn't legally obligated to pay for the stepsons' education. The husband, as the father, has a responsibility to his sons, but the author isn't bound by that. The author's resentment comes from the fact that the husband didn't discuss this with her first and now is putting pressure on her to fund both. The author is standing up for her daughter's promised future, which is understandable. The husband might be trying to be fair, but the author isn't the one responsible for the sons' education. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. She's asserting her right to prioritize her biological child's education, especially since they made that commitment. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
