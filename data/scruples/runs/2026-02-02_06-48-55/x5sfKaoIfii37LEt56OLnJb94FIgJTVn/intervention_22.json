They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a stepmom who doesn't want to pay for her stepkids' education, even though she and her husband can afford it for their biological daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband has two sons from a previous marriage, and their mother is struggling with addiction. The husband and stepmom have a daughter together. They want to send their daughter to an expensive private school, but the husband is suggesting they also send his sons there. The stepmom is upset because the husband didn't discuss this with her first and now they can't afford to send all three. She wants to prioritize their daughter and make the husband tell the sons they can't go.\n\nThe stepmom's argument is that they had already promised their daughter the private school, and the husband's sudden suggestion to include the stepsons is causing financial strain. She feels the husband is being unfair to their daughter. On the other hand, the husband is trying to provide for his children from his previous marriage, which is a legal and moral responsibility. The stepmom is now considering an ultimatum to prioritize their daughter, making the husband the one to break the news to the stepsons.\n\nNow, considering legal and moral obligations. Legally, the husband is responsible for his children's education, even if they live with their mother now. But the mother is in a bad state, so maybe the husband is taking on more responsibility. However, financially, they can only afford one child's tuition. The stepmom wants to prioritize their biological daughter, which might be seen as self-serving, but they had made that promise to her first. The husband's sons didn't express interest in private school before, but the younger one is open to it. \n\nThe stepmom's frustration is understandable because the husband didn't discuss the plan with her before presenting it to the sons. This lack of communication could be a point against the husband. But the husband is trying to fulfill his duty to his other children. The stepmom's plan to make the husband tell the sons is a way to shift responsibility, but maybe she has a right to protect their daughter's future. \n\nIs the stepmom in the wrong? It depends on perspectives. She's not legally obligated to support the stepsons, but as a spouse, she might feel pressured to contribute. However, she could argue that their resources are limited and they had already committed to their daughter. The husband's approach might be seen as neglecting the stepmom's wishes and the daughter's future. The stepmom's plan to set an ultimatum might be harsh, but her stance could be justified if they can't afford all three. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because she's making a choice based on what's been planned for her daughter and the financial constraints. The husband's sudden suggestion without discussion could be his fault. The stepmom isn't legally required to support the stepsons, so prioritizing her own child is reasonable.\n"
