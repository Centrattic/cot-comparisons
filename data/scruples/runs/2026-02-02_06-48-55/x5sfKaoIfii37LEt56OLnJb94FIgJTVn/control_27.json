They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to pay for her stepkids' education, given that they can only afford one child's private school tuition. The setup is that the husband has two sons from a previous marriage, now living with them because their mother is struggling with addiction. The author and her husband have their own daughter and had planned to send her to private school. The husband suggested to one of the stepsons that they might send him too, leading to a financial conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspect. They can only afford one child's tuition, so choosing between the biological daughter and the stepson. The author feels the husband didn't consult her before discussing with the son, which caused resentment. The husband's position is that either both kids go to private school or neither, but the author is upset because they had already promised the daughter since she was 5. The author wants to prioritize her own child's education and hold the husband accountable for discussing it with the stepson without her knowledge.\n\nIn terms of legal responsibility, in many jurisdictions, both biological and step-parents have obligations to support their children's education, depending on the laws. However, if the step-parent is not the custodial parent or if the biological parent is the one with legal responsibility, the financial obligation might lie elsewhere. But the situation here is that the husband is the legal parent of the two sons, so he's responsible for their support. However, the author is a step-parent and might not have a legal obligation to contribute to their education unless she's been acting as the primary caregiver or the court has assigned that responsibility.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels that her husband is undermining her and their daughter's future by not prioritizing their own child. The husband might feel that he's trying to be fair to all his children, but the author sees it as unfair because the promise was made to their daughter first. The key issue here is whether the author is wrong to prioritize her own child's education over her husband's stepchildren when the husband is the one legally responsible for the sons' support.\n\nIf the husband is the only one legally obligated to pay for the sons' education, then the author isn't wrong to focus on their biological daughter. The husband might have made a promise to the son without considering the financial constraints, leading to the current conflict. The author's resentment is justified if the husband didn't involve her in the decision and if the step-parent isn't legally required to contribute to the stepchildren's education.\n\nAdditionally, the husband's approach of \"both or none\" could be seen as a way to avoid conflict but ends up causing more stress if the family can't afford both. The author's plan to prioritize their daughter and have the husband explain the financial reality to the son makes sense if the husband is the one who broached the topic without consulting her. The author isn't in the wrong if the stepchildren's education isn't her responsibility and she's been clear about her own child's needs first.\n\nSo, considering the legal obligations and the emotional dynamics, the author's stance seems reasonable. She's not at fault for wanting to fulfill the promise to her daughter when she's not legally responsible for the stepchildren's education and the husband didn't communicate properly with her.\n"
