They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a stepmom and her husband dealing with financial decisions regarding their kids' education. They have their own daughter and his two sons from a previous marriage. The stepmom wants to send their daughter to a private school that's expensive, but the husband is suggesting they also pay for his younger son's schooling. They can only afford one, which creates a conflict.\n\nFirst, the author (the stepmom) is upset because her husband discussed the private school option with his son without consulting her. She feels that the plan was always for their daughter to attend, and now the husband is trying to include the stepson, which financially isn't feasible. She wants to prioritize their daughter and make the husband tell the son that they can't afford it.\n\nNow, considering legal and moral obligations. Legally, step-parents aren't required to support step-children unless they've formally adopted them. In this case, the husband is the legal father of his sons, so he has a responsibility towards them. However, the stepmom isn't legally obligated to support them. But from a moral standpoint, it's more complex. The husband has a duty to his children, but the stepmom might not share the same obligation unless she's chosen to take on that role.\n\nThe stepmom's argument is that they had always planned for their daughter's education, and the husband's suggestion to include the stepson came out of nowhere. She's upset because her husband didn't consult her first, leading to financial strain. She wants to prioritize their biological daughter, which is understandable. However, the husband is trying to balance both his children's needs, which he's responsible for.\n\nBut wait, the husband is the one who is legally responsible for his children. The stepmom isn't financially obligated to support them, so it's possible that the husband is making that decision on his own. If the husband is willing to use their shared income to support his sons, the stepmom might feel that it's unfair since she didn't raise them and has her own daughter's needs. However, if the husband is using marital funds, the stepmom might have a say, especially if they have a joint account or shared finances.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. The daughter was promised the private school from a young age, which adds to the stepmom's justification. The stepson was just introduced into the equation without prior discussion, which could be seen as the husband not considering the stepmom's perspective. The stepmom's resentment is valid because the decision affects her financially and the daughter's future.\n\nBut then again, the husband is trying to do what he thinks is right for his other son, even if it's not feasible. He might feel that since he's financially responsible, he should provide the same opportunities. However, the stepmom isn't responsible for those children, so she might not have the same duty to spend her money on them.\n\nThe key points here are legal obligations versus moral ones. Legally, the stepmom isn't in the wrong because she's not required to support step-children. Morally, it's more about what she's willing to do as a stepmother. If she's not willing to use her funds for them, that's her choice. The husband, as the father, might feel compelled to provide, but he should have discussed this with his wife first, especially since they're sharing finances. The stepmom's resentment about the husband making decisions without her is valid, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of the ultimatum she wants to issue, she's trying to assert control over the situation, which is understandable given the unexpected financial burden. But if the husband is using his own income to support his son, the stepmom might not have a say. However, if they're using joint funds, she has a right to be involved in those decisions.\n\nOverall, the stepmom isn't in the wrong because she's not legally obligated to support her stepchildren, and she has her own daughter's needs to consider. The husband might need to clarify with her before making such decisions, but the stepmom's stance is justified given the circumstances. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
