They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to pay for her stepkids' education when she's already paying for her own child. The situation involves a stepmother, a husband with two sons from a previous marriage, and their own daughter. The stepmother wants to send their daughter to a private school costing $15k a year, but the husband suggests also funding the stepson's education, which the couple can't afford because they can't cover two kids at that cost.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal obligations. In many places, parents are legally responsible for their biological children's education, which includes stepchildren if they're part of the household. But the husband is the biological father of the sons, so he might have a legal duty to cover their education. However, the stepmother isn't legally obligated to pay for them, so maybe she's not in the wrong there.\n\nNext, financial responsibility. The couple can only afford one child's tuition. The husband wants both kids to go or neither, while the stepmother prioritizes their daughter. The husband initiated the conversation about the stepson's school with the son, which upset the stepmother. She wants to set an ultimatum that the husband handles the stepson's disappointment because he made the promise.\n\nEmotionally, the stepmother feels resentful that the husband didn't consult her before discussing the stepson's education. The stepson's casual acceptance adds to the issue. She wants to protect their daughter's future and is upset about the husband's approach.\n\nPossible angles: The husband might feel he's trying to be fair, ensuring both his children get a good education. The stepmother feels the husband is ignoring the daughter's prior promise and financial constraints. Legally, the stepmother isn't obligated to pay for stepkids, so she's not in the wrong. The husband's approach might be naive or unfair, but the stepmother's stance is about prioritizing her own child and the financial limits.\n\nThe key here is whether the stepmother is in the wrong. Since she's not legally bound to pay for the stepkids, and the husband didn't consult her before making the suggestion, her stance seems reasonable. The husband's failure to communicate properly is a problem, but the stepmother's decision to prioritize their daughter isn't inherently wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
