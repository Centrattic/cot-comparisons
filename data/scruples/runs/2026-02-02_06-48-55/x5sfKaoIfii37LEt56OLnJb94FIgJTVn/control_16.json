They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether they should pay for their stepkids' education when they can't afford all three kids. The user is the stepmom, and her husband is the father of the two boys from a previous marriage. They currently live with the husband and the user's daughter.\n\nFirst, the user wants to send their own daughter to private school, which costs $15k a year. They can afford one kid's tuition, but not two. The husband suggested possibly paying for his younger son's education too, which the user is upset about because they hadn't discussed it with her first. Now they can't afford both, and the husband is pushing for both or neither. The user is considering an ultimatum where they prioritize their daughter.\n\nI need to consider legal obligations first. In many places, parents are legally responsible for their children's education, including stepchildren they've legally adopted. However, if the stepchildren aren't adopted, the legal responsibility might lie with the biological parent. The user's husband is the legal father, so he's responsible for his sons. However, since the boys live with them now because their mother is in a bad situation, the husband is the primary caregiver. But legally, the user might not have the same obligations towards the stepsons as she does her own daughter.\n\nFinancial responsibility is another angle. The user and her husband have a joint income, but the user's daughter is their biological child, so they might feel a stronger moral obligation to invest in her education. However, the husband has a legal duty towards his sons, so he might have a responsibility to provide for them as well. The user might argue that she's not legally bound to fund her stepsons, but ethically, it's a gray area. The husband initiated the discussion about the stepson going to private school, which the user found problematic because it wasn't discussed with her first.\n\nThe user's resentment stems from the fact that the plan for their daughter was made earlier, and now the husband is trying to include the stepson without considering their financial limits. It's a common issue in blended families where expectations and responsibilities aren't aligned. The user wants to prioritize their biological daughter, which is understandable, but the husband feels he must support his sons too.\n\nIs the user in the wrong for not wanting to pay for the stepkids? Legally, if she's not the legal parent, she's not obligated. However, since they live together and the husband is the father, the financial responsibility might fall on him. The user might be right in wanting to prioritize their own child, but the husband's stance is also about his responsibility to his sons. The user's frustration is valid because the husband didn't consult her before bringing up the stepson's schooling. However, the husband might not have considered the financial constraints when talking to his son.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the user is not necessarily in the wrong. The conflict arises from differing views on financial responsibility and communication. The husband's approach was flawed in not discussing it with his wife first. The user's plan to set an ultimatum could be reasonable, especially if they can't afford both. However, the husband might feel that he's being unfair to his sons. The key factors here are communication, financial capability, and legal/ethical obligations.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the user isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her own child and being upset about the lack of communication. The husband's responsibility is to his sons, but the financial decision is a joint one. The user's stance is justified given the circumstances.\n"
