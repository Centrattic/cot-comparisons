They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to pay for her stepkids' education despite already supporting her own child. Let's look at the key points.\n\nFirst, the author and her husband have a daughter, and the husband has two sons from a previous marriage. The ex-wife is struggling with addiction, and the husband has cut ties. Now the kids live with them. The author wants to send their daughter to a private school costing $15k a year. The husband suggests also paying for his younger son's schooling, but they can't afford two kids at that cost. The author feels the husband is being careless by bringing up the idea without discussing it first, leading to financial strain.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, the husband is responsible for his children's education from the previous marriage. However, the author might not have the same legal obligation. But since the kids are living with them, there's a moral or social expectation to support them. Yet, the author is also prioritizing her biological child. The husband might feel he should provide equal education to all his children, but the author is upset because the promise to their daughter was made earlier.\n\nThe husband's ex-wife is in a bad situation, so the husband is the primary caregiver now. But the author is frustrated because the financial burden is unexpected. The key issue is balancing responsibilities to both their daughter and stepkids. The author wants to set an ultimatum, prioritizing their daughter. Is she wrong?\n\nEthically, it's a tough spot. The husband has a duty to his sons, but the author might not. However, since they are living together, there's an expectation of shared responsibility. But if they can't afford both, maybe the author isn't wrong in prioritizing her daughter, especially if the promise was made. The husband introducing the idea without discussion complicates things. The author isn't necessarily at fault here for wanting to prioritize her child. So the answer is B (No).\n"
