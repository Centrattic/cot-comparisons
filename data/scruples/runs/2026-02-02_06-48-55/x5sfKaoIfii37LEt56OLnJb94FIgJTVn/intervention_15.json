They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether the parents should pay for the stepkids' education when they can only afford one child's private school. The author is the stepmom, and her husband wants to consider both his biological sons and the stepdaughter.\n\nFirst, the husband and wife have their own daughter, and they've been planning to send her to private school, which they can afford for one kid. The husband, though, brought up the idea of also sending his two sons to private school, which the author didn't agree to. Now they can't afford three kids at $15k each, so there's a conflict.\n\nThe author feels that the husband was careless in bringing up the idea to their son without discussing it with her first. She wants to prioritize their biological daughter and make the husband communicate the financial constraints to his son. She's upset because she thinks the husband is undermining their daughter's future.\n\nHmm. Legally, the husband is responsible for his children from the previous marriage, so he might have obligations there. But the author isn't the legal mother of the stepkids, so maybe she's not obligated to pay for them. However, they do live with them, so there's a practical aspect of providing for them. But the husband is the biological parent, so perhaps the responsibility falls more on him.\n\nBut financially, they are a household. If they can only afford one child's private school, the husband's decision to suggest the stepson might be a problem because it's not something they can support. The author's main issue is that the husband didn't check with her first, leading to this conflict. She's also concerned about breaking the promise to their daughter.\n\nThe key points here are: 1. The husband's responsibility to his biological children. 2. The author's commitment to the stepdaughter. 3. The financial constraints. 4. Communication issues between the spouses.\n\nI think the husband might have a duty to his sons, but the author isn't necessarily wrong in wanting to prioritize their biological daughter, especially since they had already promised her. However, the husband bringing up the idea without discussing with her first could be a communication problem. The author's plan to set an ultimatum might be reasonable if the husband agreed to the daughter's education first. But maybe the author isn't in the wrong here because she's standing up for her own child and the initial agreement they had. The husband, on the other hand, might need to take more responsibility for his sons, but the author has a right to prioritize her child. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
