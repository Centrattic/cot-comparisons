They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation involves a stepmother who's upset because her husband wants to consider paying for his two sons from a previous marriage to go to private school, but they can only afford one child. The author wants to prioritize their own biological daughter, who they've promised a private education for, and is considering telling the husband to handle the communication with his sons.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the legal and moral aspects here. Legally, the husband is responsible for his sons from his previous marriage, so he might have obligations toward them. However, the stepmother might not have the same legal responsibility. But since they live with them, maybe there's a shared responsibility. The key point here is the financial aspect. The family can't afford both children to attend private school, so there's a conflict between the interests of the biological daughter and the stepsons.\n\nThe author is upset because the husband brought up the idea to the son without consulting her first. That could be seen as a breach of communication. She feels that the promise to her daughter was made before considering the stepson, so she's prioritizing her own child. However, the husband sees it as a joint decision and is pushing for both to have the same opportunity, which the author resents.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's a tough call. The stepmother might feel that she has to prioritize her own child's future, especially if the promise was made. On the other hand, the husband is trying to be fair to both his children. The stepmother's resentment might be justified if she feels the husband didn't consider her feelings or their prior commitment. But the husband's desire to provide equal education for both his children is also understandable.\n\nAnother angle is the stepmother's role. She's not the biological parent of the boys, so perhaps she doesn't have the same emotional investment. However, since they live with her, she might feel responsible. The fact that the stepsons' mother is in a bad situation adds another layer. The husband's responsibility to his children is clear, but the financial constraints complicate things.\n\nThe author is considering an ultimatum where the husband has to break the news to his sons. This might be a way to shift the responsibility back to the husband, who initiated the conversation. But is it fair to the sons? They might not have been informed of the financial limitations until now. The author's plan could be seen as a way to protect her daughter's future, but it might also leave the stepsons in a difficult situation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a clear-cut case. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's prioritizing her own child's education, especially when a promise was made. However, the husband's responsibility to his sons can't be ignored. The key issue is communication. The husband should have discussed it with his wife before bringing it up to the sons. The author's resentment is valid in that aspect. But when it comes to the financial decision, it's a matter of prioritizing limited resources. Since they can't afford both, the author's stance might be justified, especially if they had already committed to their daughter's education. So, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
