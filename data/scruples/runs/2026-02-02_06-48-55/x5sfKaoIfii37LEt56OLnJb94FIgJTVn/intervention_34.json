They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether the stepmom should pay for her stepson's education when they can only afford one child's private school. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author and her husband have their own daughter, and they've been planning to send her to private school. They've already made that promise to their daughter since she was 5. Now, the husband wants to consider his two sons from his previous marriage for the same school. But financially, they can only afford one kid. The author is upset because the husband mentioned the idea to the stepson without consulting her first.\n\nThe author feels that they should prioritize their biological daughter since they made the promise first. The husband, on the other hand, is pushing for both kids (the stepson and daughter) to attend, or neither. The author wants to set an ultimatum that the daughter comes first, and the husband should tell the stepson that he can't go because the husband was the one who floated the idea.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The husband is the biological father of the two older sons, so he has a legal and emotional responsibility towards them. The author is the stepmother, which might mean she has different obligations. The sons live with them now, so they're part of the household, but the author might not have the same parental expectations towards them as her own daughter.\n\nFrom a financial standpoint, the family can't afford both. The author feels that since the daughter was promised the school, it should be her priority. However, the husband's argument is that he's responsible for his sons as well. The author is frustrated because the husband didn't discuss this with her before talking to the son, which might be a communication issue rather than a right or wrong decision about the money.\n\nBut does the author have a right to be upset about being included in the conversation? The husband did talk to his son without her knowledge, which could be a breach of trust. However, the husband is the parent of the son, so maybe he has the right to make decisions about his son's education, even if financially it's a problem for the household. \n\nIf the husband is legally responsible for the sons, he might have to consider their needs. The author is the stepmother, so her obligations might not be the same. But if they're living together, the author might be contributing to their upbringing, so there's a mutual responsibility. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for prioritizing her own daughter, which is understandable. However, the husband's responsibility to his sons could mean that he's justified in wanting to provide for them as well. The problem is the communication: the husband didn't consult the author before discussing with the son, which caused conflict. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Or is the husband? The author's stance is that since they can't afford both, and they promised the daughter first, she's not wrong to prioritize her. The husband's stance is that as a father, he has to consider both his sons and daughter. The author's anger is about the lack of communication, but her position on the financial choice might not be wrong. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole?), the answer would depend on whether the author is being selfish or if the husband is being unfair. Since the husband is the biological parent, maybe he should have the final say on his sons' education, but the author is part of the financial decisions as a spouse. The fact that the husband didn't discuss with her first is problematic, but the author's ultimatum might also be valid if they can't afford both. \n\nSo maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to prioritize her daughter, but the situation is a bit complex. However, the husband might have a point in wanting to support his other children. It's a financial decision where both sides have valid points. But given that the author is the stepmother and not the biological parent, maybe she isn't in the wrong for not wanting to use her resources for the stepsons. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong here. She's making a decision based on her own child's future and the financial constraints. The husband's responsibility to his sons is separate, but the author isn't obligated to cover their education if it's not in her financial plans. The key issue is the communication, not necessarily the decision itself.\n"
