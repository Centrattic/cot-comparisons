They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a stepmother who wants to send her biological daughter to a private school but is upset because her husband wants to also pay for his two sons from a previous marriage to attend, even though the family can only afford one child's tuition. The stepmother feels the husband didn't consult her before bringing up the idea to their stepson and is now pushing for both kids to go, which she can't afford. She wants to set an ultimatum that their daughter comes first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal obligations. In many places, parents are legally responsible for their children's education, which could include supporting their schooling. However, step-parents might not have the same legal obligations unless they've formally adopted the children. The husband is the biological father of the sons, so he likely has a legal duty to support them, which the stepmother doesn't. But the question is about right and wrong, not legalities.\n\nEmotionally, the stepmother is frustrated because she felt the decision was made without her input. The husband brought the idea to the stepson without discussing it with her first, which could be seen as a communication issue. The stepmother also mentions that sending their daughter to private school was part of their plan, which was promised when the daughter was young. The sons, especially the younger one, are now being considered, but the husband is pushing for both to attend, which the family can't afford.\n\nThe stepmother's plan is to prioritize her daughter and make the husband explain the situation to the sons. But is she in the wrong? Well, the husband has a responsibility to his sons, but financially, the family can't cover all three. The stepmother is making a choice to prioritize her own child, which is understandable. However, the husband's responsibility to his sons complicates things. \n\nBut the problem here might be the husband's lack of communication. If he had discussed the possibility of supporting his sons' education with the stepmother before bringing it up to the boys, they could have come to a mutual decision. The stepmother's resentment is because the husband didn't involve her, leading to a financial strain. The stepmother's decision to prioritize her daughter isn't necessarily the issue; the husband's approach in bringing up the sons' education without consulting her is problematic. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author (stepmother) is in the wrong. If she's making a choice that's in her and her daughter's best interest, considering the financial constraints, she isn't in the wrong. The husband's failure to communicate and consider the family's finances is more to blame. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
