They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a stepmom who's upset because her husband wants to send his two sons to private school, but they can't afford it all. The author wants to prioritize their own daughter's education, which they've already promised to her. The husband, on the other hand, is saying both kids should go or neither, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, parents are legally responsible for their children's education, which can include financial obligations. Since the husband has two sons from his previous marriage, he's still their legal parent, so he's responsible for their schooling. The stepmom isn't a legal parent to the boys, so she might not have the same obligations. However, if they're living in the same household, the family might be pooling resources for all the kids.\n\nFinancially, they can't afford all three kids going to private school. The author argues that they've already promised their daughter the private education, which is part of their plan. The husband introduced the idea to his son without consulting the author, which upset her. The husband now wants to share the cost for his sons, but the author feels this is unfair because the promise to their daughter was made first.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels her husband is undermining their daughter's future by not considering the prior commitment. The husband might be trying to be fair to both his children, but his approach of discussing it with the son first without consulting his wife was a mistake. The author's resentment comes from the unexpectedness and the financial strain.\n\nNow, considering ethics and fairness. Legally, the husband must support his sons, but financially, the family is making a choice between their resources. The author's stance is that they should prioritize their biological daughter, whom they've already committed to. However, the husband is also a parent to the boys, so he might feel obligated to provide them with similar opportunities. The conflict here is between existing commitments and new financial demands.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to pay for the stepkids? If the husband is legally responsible, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she's not the legal parent. But if the family is co-parenting all the kids, then maybe there's an expectation to share costs. The husband's approach was poor\u2014bringing up the option to the son without discussing it with his wife first is a communication issue. The author's resentment is valid because the promise to their daughter was made first, and the husband didn't consider the financial impact.\n\nHowever, the husband's desire to provide for all his children isn't inherently wrong. The problem is the lack of communication and the sudden financial pressure. The author's plan to set an ultimatum might be necessary to protect their daughter's future, but maybe a more collaborative approach would be better. But the question is if she's in the wrong. Since she isn't legally obligated to support the stepkids, and the husband's approach was flawed, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But if the family had agreed to co-parent all kids, then the author might be expected to contribute. The key is whether there was prior agreement about educational expenses for the stepchildren. Since the husband brought it up without discussing, the author's stance could be justified.\n"
