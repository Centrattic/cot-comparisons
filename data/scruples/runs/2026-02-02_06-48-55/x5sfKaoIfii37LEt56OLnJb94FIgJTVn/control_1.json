They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the woman in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to pay for her stepkids' education when she can only afford one child's private school tuition. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal obligations. In many places, parents are legally required to support their children, including education. But the husband is the biological father of the two sons, so he's financially responsible for them. However, the wife isn't their biological mother, so she might not have a legal obligation to contribute. That's a key point.\n\nFinancially, they can only afford one private school tuition. The couple has a daughter they've planned for since she was 5, and now the husband wants to consider the stepsons. The wife feels it's unfair because the stepsons' mother is struggling with addiction and the stepsons have recently moved in. The husband brought up the idea without discussing it with his wife first, which caused tension.\n\nEmotionally, the wife is upset because the promise to their daughter was made a long time ago, and the husband's son accepted the idea casually. She's resentful that the husband didn't consult her first. She wants an ultimatum to prioritize their daughter, which she feels is justified.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Legally, maybe not, since she's not the biological parent. However, ethically, it's more complex. The husband is responsible for his sons' education, so he should cover their costs. If he's not doing that, maybe he's not fulfilling his duty. But if he's using their joint income to pay for both, the wife might be right to prioritize their own child. \n\nThe husband's behavior of introducing the idea without discussing it with his wife first is poor communication. The wife's resentment is understandable. The core issue is financial priorities and communication. Since they can't afford all three, they have to decide which is more important. The wife's stance is that their own child's education was promised first, which is a valid perspective. \n\nIn conclusion, the wife isn't in the wrong. The main issues are the husband's communication and financial responsibility towards his sons. The wife's priority on their daughter's education is reasonable given the circumstances. So the answer should be B.\n"
