They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a stepmother who wants to send her biological daughter to a private school starting next year, but her husband, who has two sons from a previous marriage, is suggesting sending his sons there as well. The key points are financial constraints and the stepmother's feelings about the husband's approach.\n\nFirst, the family's income can only afford one child at $15k a year. The daughter was promised this education since she was 5, which is a significant commitment. The husband introduced the idea to his sons without discussing it with the wife, leading to the stepmother feeling blindsided. She's upset because they can't afford three kids at that school and wants to prioritize their daughter. The husband is pushing for both or none, which the wife sees as sabotage.\n\nThe stepmother wants to set an ultimatum: prioritize their daughter's education, and let the husband inform his son about the financial reality. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nLegally, the husband is responsible for his sons, but the wife isn't their parent. Financially, they can't afford all three. Emotionally, the daughter was promised this school, and the husband's casual mention to the sons without consulting his wife caused tension. The husband's approach might be seen as not considering the wife's feelings or the existing promise to their daughter.\n\nThe stepmother's resentment is understandable. The husband's decision to discuss the school with his sons without including his wife was a misstep. The wife's plan to prioritize their daughter, given the financial limits and the prior commitment, seems reasonable. However, the husband's desire for his sons' education is also valid, but he should have communicated better with his wife.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the wife isn't legally obligated to pay for her stepsons' education unless the husband's income is part of a custody agreement. The husband is the one financially responsible for his sons, so he should handle those obligations. The wife isn't in the wrong for not wanting to stretch their finances beyond what they can afford, especially since they had already committed to their daughter. The husband's mistake was not discussing the financial implications with his wife before bringing it up to the boys.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
