They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a stepmom and her husband dealing with their daughter's private school tuition versus the husband's responsibility for his two sons from a previous marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The woman and her husband have their own daughter, and he has two sons. The sons used to live with their mom, who has addiction issues. The husband is financially responsible for the sons. The woman wants to send their daughter to a private school costing $15k a year. The husband suggested also paying for his younger son's school, which would double the tuition to $30k. They can't afford that, and the woman is upset because the husband discussed the option with the son without consulting her. She wants to make an ultimatum that their daughter gets priority, and the husband should break the news to the son.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the woman is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate it.\n\nFrom a financial responsibility standpoint, the husband has a legal obligation to support his children from the previous marriage. The mother of those children is struggling with addiction, which complicates things. However, the husband is the parent, so he's responsible for their well-being, including education. The woman is now part of the step-parent role, which doesn't automatically require her to support the stepchildren financially unless she's in a legal guardianship or has accepted that responsibility.\n\nThe woman's argument is that they can't afford both tuitions and that the promise was made to their biological daughter first. However, the husband has a duty to his sons as a parent. The woman might be right in prioritizing their own daughter, but the husband's sons are still his legal children. The woman isn't legally obligated to support them, but the husband is. The woman might not be in the wrong if she's not taking on that responsibility. However, the husband might feel conflicted between his current and ex-wife's children.\n\nBut the woman is upset that the husband discussed the option with the son without her input. That could be a valid point about communication issues. However, the core issue is financial allocation. If they can't afford both, the woman's stance of prioritizing their daughter might be reasonable. But the husband might believe he should provide for his sons as well, even if they're not with the mother anymore.\n\nThe woman's plan to make an ultimatum could be seen as taking a hard stance, but if the husband is the one legally responsible for the sons, maybe she isn't in the wrong for not wanting to bear that financial burden. However, the husband's decision to propose the plan without consulting her is problematic. The woman's resentment is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might be trying to provide for all his children, which is a parental responsibility. The woman's focus on their biological daughter's education might be seen as self-serving, but she isn't their biological parent. However, she's the stepmother, and step-parents aren't legally obligated to support stepchildren unless they've adopted them. So maybe she's not in the wrong for not wanting to take on that responsibility. \n\nBut the situation is complex. The husband's sons are under his care now, so he's responsible for their needs. The woman might be in the right to not want to pay for them since it's his responsibility, but the husband is the one who initiated the discussion. The woman could argue that she isn't responsible for his children from a previous marriage. \n\nIn terms of morality, some might say the woman is being selfish, but legally and ethically, if the husband is the biological parent, he should bear the cost. The woman isn't in the wrong for not wanting to contribute financially to his sons. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
