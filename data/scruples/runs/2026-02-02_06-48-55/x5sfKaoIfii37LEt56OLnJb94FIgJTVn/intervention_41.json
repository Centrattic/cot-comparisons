They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a stepmom and her husband with a daughter and two stepsons. The stepmom wants to send their biological daughter to a private school that costs $15k a year. The husband, who has two kids from a previous marriage, now living with them, is suggesting paying for his younger son's school as well. They can't afford both, so the stepmom is upset because she feels the husband is being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal obligations. In many places, parents are responsible for their children's education, which usually includes public schools. Private school costs are typically a parent's choice unless required by a custody agreement. The husband might have a legal obligation to support his sons, but the stepmom isn't their legal parent, so she isn't obligated to pay for their education.\n\nEmotionally, the stepmom feels the husband didn't consult her before discussing the private school option with his son. That's a valid point\u2014communication is key in partnerships. The husband's action might have caused her distress by making a promise they couldn't keep. The stepmom's resentment is understandable because she had prior commitments to their daughter.\n\nFinancially, they can only afford one child's private education. The stepmom argues that they promised their daughter first, so she should get priority. The husband wants both or neither, which might be his way of trying to be fair. But if they can't afford both, the husband's stance could be unrealistic. However, he's trying to consider both children's needs.\n\nEthically, the stepmom isn't legally responsible for the stepsons, but being in a family, there might be expectations of support. However, she's within her rights to prioritize her biological child. The husband's sons are his responsibility, and he should handle their education costs unless he's in a new agreement with his ex or there's a court order. \n\nThe stepmom's plan to set an ultimatum seems reasonable since they can't afford both. She's not in the wrong for wanting to honor the promise to their daughter. The husband's mistake was not discussing the financial implications and the promise made to his son without consulting his wife. She's justified in feeling that the husband didn't consider how this would affect their original plan and their daughter's future.\n\nSo, considering all angles\u2014legal, financial, emotional\u2014the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's actions contributed to the conflict. The stepmom's stance to prioritize their daughter is valid given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
