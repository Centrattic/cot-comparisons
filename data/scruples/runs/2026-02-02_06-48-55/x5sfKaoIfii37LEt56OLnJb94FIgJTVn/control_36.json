They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to pay for her stepkids' education even though she's paying for her own child's private school.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and her husband have a 7-year-old daughter. The husband has two older sons, 11 and 15, from a previous marriage. The sons used to live with their mom, who's now struggling with drug addiction and is in bad health. The husband has cut ties with his ex but is still responsible for the kids. Now, the author wants to send their daughter to a private school costing $15k a year. They thought they could afford it, but the husband suggested the stepson might also go, which would make it $30k total. They can't afford that. The author is upset because the husband mentioned the idea to the stepson without her knowing, and she wants to prioritize their daughter's education since they promised her. The husband insists either both go or neither, and the author is considering an ultimatum.\n\nSo, the key points here are about financial responsibility and prior commitments. The author's husband is legally responsible for both children, as they are his. The author is the stepmother who has built a relationship with the stepsons, but the decision to send the daughter to private school was made before the stepsons moved in. The husband's ex is in a bad situation, so the stepsons are now living with them. \n\nThe author argues that they can't afford both and wants to prioritize their biological daughter. The husband wants to treat both kids equally. The author is upset because the husband brought up the idea to the stepson without discussing it with her first, which might have led to unrealistic expectations. The stepson's casual acceptance is also a point of contention.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a mix of legal and emotional factors. Legally, the husband is the parent of the stepsons, and as a family unit, they might share the responsibility. However, the financial burden could be a point where the author is justified in not wanting to stretch their resources. The promise to their daughter was made before the stepsons were in the picture, so there might be a sense of entitlement to that commitment. \n\nBut then, the husband's stance is about equality. If the stepsons are living with them and the husband is their legal parent, it's possible he feels responsible to provide similar opportunities. However, the author's resentment is about the way it was handled\u2014without prior discussion, leading to a potential financial strain. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the family is now a unit, maybe the husband believes they should all be treated equally. However, the author might not have that same level of responsibility, especially if she wasn't the one who made the promise to the stepsons. Also, the stepsons' mother isn't capable of supporting them, so the husband might be right to take on more responsibility. \n\nBut the author is the one contributing her own resources to the daughter's education. The husband's ex's situation is dire, so the stepsons might be in a more vulnerable position. However, the author could argue that she's not the legal parent of the stepsons and thus isn't obligated to pay for their education. \n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. The daughter was promised a private school education since she was 5, which is a significant commitment. The stepsons moving in two years ago might not have been part of the original financial planning. The husband's approach of either both or none could be seen as trying to be fair, but it's causing a conflict with the author's priorities. \n\nI think the author is not necessarily in the wrong because she's not the legal parent of the stepsons and the promise was made specifically to her biological child. However, the husband's responsibility as their parent is a factor. The way the husband handled the situation (talking to the stepson without consulting the author) is problematic, which supports her resentment. So, the answer might be B, No.\n"
