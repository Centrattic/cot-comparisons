They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong regarding the situation with their stepkids' education. The author wants to send their biological daughter to a private school costing $15k a year. The husband, who has two sons from a previous marriage, recently mentioned possibly sending the younger son to the same school. The couple can't afford both, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, legal responsibility. The husband is the legal parent of both his sons and the author's daughter. Legally, he's required to support his own children. However, the author is also part of the current family and may have financial obligations towards the stepchildren. But the question is more about moral/ethical responsibility.\n\nThe author argues that they had a plan for their daughter's education and that the husband brought up the idea to the stepson without consulting the author. The husband now wants both kids to go or none, which the author disagrees with. The author feels the husband is prioritizing the stepson over their daughter, leading to resentment.\n\nFinancial constraints are a key point. The couple can only afford one child's tuition. They can't support all three. So, the husband's suggestion to include the stepson might be seen as adding an unexpected financial burden without prior discussion.\n\nThe author's plan is to prioritize their own child, which is understandable. Parents often prioritize their biological children. However, the stepchildren are also part of their household now, and the husband is their father. The author might be seen as neglecting the stepchildren's needs, especially since the husband is financially responsible for them. But the author didn't have input until the husband introduced the idea to the son.\n\nMoral standpoint: Is it fair to the stepson not to be considered? But the author wasn't consulted. The husband should have discussed this with both partners before making promises. However, the stepson wasn't consulted either. The author is now in a bind between their daughter's future and the stepson's potential needs.\n\nThe author might be justified in feeling that the husband didn't consider their financial plan. The stepson's casual acceptance could also be a factor. However, the husband has a duty to his sons. The author might be right to set boundaries here, especially if they weren't part of the initial decision. But the husband's actions could be seen as trying to balance both children's needs, even if it's a financial stretch.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the husband's approach was flawed because he didn't consult the author before discussing it with the son. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own child, especially given the financial constraints and the prior commitment to their daughter. However, there's a responsibility to the stepchildren as well. It's a tough call, but the author's stance might be understandable given the circumstances.\n"
