They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a step-parent, a biological child, and stepchildren from the husband's previous marriage. The main issue is about funding private school for their daughter versus the stepsons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband and wife have their own daughter, and the husband has two sons from a previous marriage. The sons used to live with their mother, who has serious addiction issues and is on the brink of death. The husband is legally responsible for those sons, and now they live with the current family. \n\nThe wife wants to send their daughter to a private school costing $15k a year. They can't afford to send all three kids because that would be $30k plus the oldest is in high school and not switching. The husband suggests that if they take the younger son, then both stepsons should go, but they can't afford that. The wife is upset because the husband discussed the possibility with the son without her knowledge and now wants to set an ultimatum: daughter first, and the husband should explain to the son.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me analyze. The key points are financial responsibility, promises made to the daughter, and the husband's responsibility towards his sons. The wife feels the husband is being unfair and is trying to push the financial burden onto her by not informing her about the son. \n\nLegally, the husband is responsible for his children's support, including education, especially if they live under the same roof. However, the wife is the stepmother, not the legal guardian. The husband's sons might have a right to expect a certain level of education from their father, given their mother's situation. The wife's daughter is their own biological child, so the parents have a direct responsibility towards her education. \n\nThe husband's action of discussing the school change with his son without consulting his wife was poor communication. However, the husband's responsibility towards his sons is a valid point. The wife's plan to prioritize her daughter is understandable, but it might be seen as neglecting the legal and moral obligations towards the stepchildren. \n\nThe question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong. If she is prioritizing her biological child over the stepchildren, is that fair? There's a sense that the husband has a duty to his sons, and the wife, as a stepmother, might not have the same legal obligation. However, once the stepchildren live with them, they might expect some level of support. \n\nThe wife's resentment about the casual way the husband brought it up is valid, but the core issue is whether she's in the wrong for not wanting to pay for the stepsons. If the husband is legally responsible, then the financial burden is on him, not the stepmother. However, the family is pooling resources, so the wife might feel it's unfair that her own child's education is being compromised. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband should have discussed this with his wife first. The wife's plan to set an ultimatum is a reaction to that miscommunication and the financial strain. But legally and morally, the husband's sons have a claim to his financial support. The wife's plan could be seen as putting her daughter first without considering the husband's obligations. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the husband is responsible for his sons, then the wife isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her own daughter, but the husband's communication was flawed. However, the author is focusing on her own child, which is natural, but the husband's sons are part of his legal responsibility. The answer might depend on whether the husband is using the wife's resources without her consent. If the wife is contributing to the household income, then it's a shared responsibility. But she might not be obligated to pay for stepchildren. \n\nIn summary, the author's resentment is valid due to the husband's communication, but the core issue is whether she's in the wrong for not wanting to pay. Since she's not the legal parent of the stepchildren, she might not be in the wrong, but the husband's actions might be the problem. However, the answer could be nuanced. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
