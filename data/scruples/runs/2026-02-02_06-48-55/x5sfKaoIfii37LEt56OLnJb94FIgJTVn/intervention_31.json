They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA situation is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author (a stepmom) and her husband have their own daughter, and he has two sons from a previous marriage. They\u2019ve been living with the author\u2019s family for two years because the biological mom is dealing with addiction. The author wants to send their daughter to a private school that costs $15k a year. However, the husband brought up the idea of also sending his younger son to the same school without discussing it with her first. Now they can\u2019t afford both, and the author is upset because she feels the husband is prioritizing his son over their daughter, and she wants to set an ultimatum that their daughter comes first.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they\u2019re asking for my opinion. I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. Legally, the husband is responsible for his sons from a previous marriage, so he might have obligations to support their education. However, the author isn\u2019t their biological mother, so she might not have the same legal responsibility. But they live together as a family now, so the husband might be sharing expenses. \n\nEthically, the question is about fairness. The author feels they made a promise to their daughter, but the husband thinks both kids should be treated equally. The husband brought up the idea to his son without discussing it with the author, which caused conflict. The author wants to prioritize their own child, which is understandable, but is that fair to the stepchildren? On the other hand, the husband\u2019s sons have a biological parent (the husband) who is now their primary caregiver, so maybe the husband has a duty to support them. \n\nThe key points are financial responsibility and fairness. The author is upset because the husband didn\u2019t consult her before making the promise to his son. The husband might be trying to balance both families, but the author feels her own child\u2019s future is being compromised. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author\u2019s stance is that their daughter\u2019s education was planned, and the husband\u2019s casual approach to the sons\u2019 education without discussing the financial impact is the issue. However, the husband has a legal and moral obligation to his children, so not supporting their education could be seen as neglecting that duty. \n\nBut the author isn\u2019t legally responsible for the stepchildren, so she might not be wrong for prioritizing her own child. However, the husband\u2019s decision to bring up the idea to his son without discussing the financial aspect with his wife is problematic. The author\u2019s plan to set an ultimatum might be necessary given their financial constraints, but it could create tension between the husband and his sons. \n\nSo, considering all angles, is the author in the wrong? I think not. She\u2019s advocating for her own child and the commitment they made to her. The husband should have considered the financial implications before making promises. Therefore, the author isn\u2019t in the wrong.\n"
