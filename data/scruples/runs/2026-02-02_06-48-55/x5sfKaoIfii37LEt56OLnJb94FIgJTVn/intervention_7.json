They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a family with a daughter from the current marriage and two stepsons from the husband's previous marriage. The parents want to send their daughter to a private school costing $15k a year, but the husband suggests also paying for the stepsons' education, which they can't afford. The author is upset that the husband didn't consult her first and wants to prioritize their daughter.\n\nFirst, legal obligations. Legally, the husband is responsible for supporting his children from the previous marriage. So if he's financially responsible for them, maybe he has a duty to consider their education. However, the author's point is that they can't afford all three. The husband might think he's being fair, but the author feels it's unfair to their daughter.\n\nFinancial responsibility: The husband made a promise to the stepson without consulting the wife. The wife had already planned for their daughter's education. The husband's action could be seen as undermining the daughter's future. The wife is now in a bind because the husband's decision affects their financial plan. \n\nEmotional aspect: The wife feels the husband is being unfair to their daughter. She's resentful because the stepson accepted the idea casually. The husband might feel he's being fair to both children, but he didn't consider the wife's perspective or the daughter's prior promise.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author wants to set an ultimatum to prioritize their daughter. Is this fair? Legally, the husband must support his children, but if the money is split, maybe the daughter's education is being compromised. The husband's action of not consulting the wife first is problematic. The author's plan to make the husband explain to the stepson seems reasonable because he initiated the conversation. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for not wanting to pay for the stepsons? If the husband is legally obligated to support them, then the author might be resisting a duty. However, if the support is already covered in child support, maybe the private school is an additional expense. The scenario isn't clear on that. Assuming the stepsons' education is part of the husband's responsibility, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting it. But if the husband didn't consult her and the stepsons are not covered under existing support, the author's stance makes sense. \n\nAlso, the daughter was promised the private school first. The husband's sudden inclusion of the stepsons could be seen as a betrayal of that promise. The husband's approach was careless, not considering the wife's and daughter's needs. The author's resentment is understandable. \n\nSo, the husband made a unilateral decision, which is part of the problem. The author's plan to make the husband take responsibility for breaking the promise to the stepson is fair. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The husband's actions were the initial issue. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
