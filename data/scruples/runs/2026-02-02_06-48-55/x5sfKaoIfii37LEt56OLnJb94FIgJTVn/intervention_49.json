They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style question is in the wrong regarding the stepkid's education. The situation involves a stepmother who's upset because her husband suggested sending his two sons to private school, which would be financially impossible alongside their daughter. The author wants to prioritize their biological daughter but is frustrated that the husband didn't consult her first.\n\nFirst, legal obligations: The husband is the legal parent of the stepkids, so he might have a duty to support their education. But the stepmother isn't the legal parent, so she's not legally obligated to contribute. However, morally or ethically, it's a gray area. The stepkids live with them now due to their mother's addiction, so the husband is taking on responsibility. The author might feel that she's not responsible for the stepkids' education since they're not her biological children. \n\nEmotional aspects: The author made a promise to her daughter, which adds weight to her desire to fulfill that. The husband introduced the idea to the stepson without discussing with the wife, which caused conflict. The author wants to set an ultimatum, prioritizing their daughter. The husband's stance is that both should have equal access, but the financial reality is only one can be afforded. \n\nConsiderations: 1. Legal vs. moral responsibility. 2. The husband's duty to his children. 3. The stepmother's role and expectations. 4. The impact on all children's well-being. \n\nPossible angles: Is the author wrong for not wanting to pay for the stepkids? If the husband is the legal parent, he's responsible for their education. The stepmother isn't legally bound, but might feel moral pressure. The husband's responsibility to his children could mean he should cover their education, even if the stepmother isn't required. However, if the husband is using joint funds, the stepmother might have a right to object if she's not obligated. \n\nThe author's resentment comes from the husband not consulting her and the casual approach. She's prioritizing her child's future, which is understandable. The husband's approach could be seen as trying to be fair, but without considering the financial constraints. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Legally, probably not. Morally, it's debatable. If the husband is using shared funds, he might be responsible to the stepkids, but the stepmother isn't. The author's stance is about her own child's promise, which is valid. The husband's responsibility is to his children, but the stepmother isn't required to contribute. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's not legally bound and the husband should handle his children's education without making her pay.\n"
