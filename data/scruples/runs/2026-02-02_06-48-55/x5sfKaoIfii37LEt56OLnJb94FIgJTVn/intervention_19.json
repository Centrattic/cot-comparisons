They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a stepmom who doesn't want to pay for her stepkids' education while she's already funding her own child's private school. The husband has two sons from a previous marriage, and the family can only afford one child's tuition.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal responsibilities. In many places, parents are legally required to support their biological children, even if they're not living with the other parent. So the husband is obligated to pay for his sons' education, especially since they live with him now. However, the stepmom isn't the legal parent, so she might not have that obligation. But the husband is their father, so he's responsible.\n\nNext, the financial aspect. The family can't afford to send all three kids to private school. The husband wants to ensure his sons get a good education too, but the stepmom is upset because the plan was for their daughter. The husband brought up the idea to his son without discussing it with the stepmom first, which caused tension.\n\nThe stepmom's argument is that they promised their daughter private school, so it's a priority. But the husband is also trying to fulfill his duty as a father to his other children. The stepmom is upset that the son was told first and accepted it casually, but maybe the son's attitude isn't the main issue here.\n\nLegally, the husband is responsible for his own children. The stepmom might not have a legal obligation to pay for them, but financially, since they live together, the household income is shared. If the husband is using joint funds, then the stepmom might feel it's her money too. However, the husband's responsibility to his children might take precedence.\n\nThe stepmom wants to set an ultimatum that their daughter comes first. But if the husband is legally required to support his sons, and they live under his roof, he can't just ignore that. The stepmom's resentment might be valid if she feels pressured to spend on stepkids when she didn't have that obligation. However, the husband's duty as a father could mean he needs to find a way to provide for all his children, even if it strains the finances.\n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. The daughter was promised the school from a young age, and the stepmom feels the husband is undermining that. But the husband might feel he's being fair by considering his other children's needs. The key issue is whether the stepmom is obligated to support stepchildren financially. If not, then she's not in the wrong for prioritizing her own child. If the husband is using their shared finances, then she might have a point in feeling resentful.\n\nIn many cases, stepparents aren't legally obligated to support stepchildren unless they've formally adopted them. So the husband is the one responsible. The stepmom isn't at fault for not wanting to spend on the stepkids when the resources are limited. The husband's approach of bringing up the idea to the son without discussing it with his wife first was poor handling, but the stepmom's stance seems reasonable if she's not legally bound to support them. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
