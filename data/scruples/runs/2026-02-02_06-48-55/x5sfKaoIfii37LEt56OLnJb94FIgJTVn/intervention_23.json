They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether they should pay for their stepkids' education when they can't afford all of them. The author and their husband have their own daughter, and he has two sons from a previous marriage. They live with them now because the ex is in bad shape.\n\nThe author wants to send their daughter to a private school costing $15k a year. The husband then brings up the idea of also paying for his younger son's schooling, which they realize they can't afford (totaling $30k). The author feels upset because the husband didn't discuss this with her first and now wants both or none. The author is considering an ultimatum to prioritize their daughter.\n\nFirst, legal obligations: The husband is the legal parent of the stepkids, so he's legally responsible for their education. However, in many places, stepparents aren't legally required to support stepchildren unless they've formally adopted them. The question is more about moral obligation here.\n\nFinancially, they can't afford all three. The author argues that they promised their daughter the private school, and it's part of their plan. The husband wants fairness between the kids. The author is upset that the husband discussed it with the stepson without her input.\n\nThe key points are: Did the husband have the authority to make that promise? Legally, maybe, but financially, the family's resources are shared. The author feels the decision should be made together. The husband's unilateral action caused conflict.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for not wanting to pay for the stepkids? Well, the husband is the biological parent, so he might feel he should support his children. But the author isn't their biological parent. She's within her rights to prioritize her own child's education. The husband, however, might believe he should support his sons. The conflict arises from differing priorities.\n\nThe author's resentment is about the husband making decisions without her, which is reasonable. The husband's approach could be seen as not respecting her role in financial decisions. However, the author might also be neglecting her husband's parental responsibilities.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband might feel he needs to provide for all his children. The author's plan to prioritize their daughter is valid if they can only afford one. But the husband's stance is about treating his two sons fairly. The author's ultimatum could be seen as selfish, but she's also justifying it based on prior commitments to her own daughter.\n\nSo, considering all that, it's a bit of a toss-up. But the author isn't in the wrong because she's not legally obligated to pay for the stepkids. However, the husband has a duty to his own children. The author's resentment stems from being kept in the loop, which is a valid point. The answer would depend on the dynamics of their marriage and the expectations they have. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess based on the situation. I think the author isn't in the wrong because she's not legally required to pay and the husband should have discussed it first. So the answer is B.\n"
