They currently live with us but had been living with his mom up until about 2 years ago. Their mom is really messed up, addicted to drugs now and on the brink of death basically due to her addictions. My husband has largely cut ties with his ex-wife but is obviously still responsible for his sons. \n\nSo here's my current dilemma: I want to send my daughter to private school, starting next year. It'll be expensive, like 15k a year, but I've talked to my husband and we can spare the money because we want our daughter to get a top-tier education. However, a few weeks ago my husband confronted me about potentially paying for his younger son's schooling as well. His oldest being in high school already is uninterested in switching schools but his younger son is apparently not opposed to the idea. I was upset because he told his son this without even telling me. \n\nBetween our salaries, we can only really afford one kid to go to a 15k/year school. I'm a bit upset because sending our daughter to private was always part of the plan, and yet my husband just casually floated the idea to his son only for him to say \"ok sure.\" And now that we've done the math we realize that we can't at all afford 30k on tuition. I still want to send my daughter to that school because we've promised her so since she was about 5, but my husband says either both kids go or neither does. I feel like he's intentionally sabotaging our daughter's chances and it's making me really upset. However I get that he wants the best for his kid as well but I resent how casually it was raised and how his son responded so casually to his dad's question. \n\nI want to issue an ultimatum to my husband. Basically we pay for our daughter's schooling first and foremost because we made the promise to her first, and I want my husband to tell his son the bad news because he was the one that promised him something neither of us could deliver. AITA for thinking this is a good plan?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a stepkid's education and financial decisions.\n\nFirst, the author is a stepmother, and her husband has two sons from a previous marriage. The kids have been with them for two years because their mom is struggling with addiction and on the brink of death. The author and her husband want to send their biological daughter to a private school costing $15k a year. They can afford it for one child but not two. The husband then suggested the younger son might also go, which the author is upset about because it was introduced without her and they can't afford it for both.\n\nThe author is considering an ultimatum where their daughter's education is prioritized since it was promised to her first, and she wants the husband to tell the son that the promise can't be kept. She feels the husband is being careless and that the son responded too casually.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's the case. Let's consider the key points:\n\n1. **Financial Responsibility**: The couple can only afford one child at that school. The husband proposed including the stepson without prior discussion, which upset the author. The author's stance is to prioritize their own daughter because the promise was made to her first. The husband, however, is trying to balance both children's needs, which is understandable as a parent.\n\n2. **Communication**: The husband didn't discuss with the author before telling the son. This could be a problem. The author is right to be upset about the lack of communication, especially since it's a significant financial decision.\n\n3. **Children's Best Interests**: The oldest son is uninterested in switching, so he might not want to. The younger son is open to it. The author wants to keep the promise to her daughter, which is valid. The husband's desire to provide the same opportunity for his son is also valid, but the financial constraint complicates it.\n\n4. **Step-Parent Dynamics**: The author is a stepmother, so her role in funding the stepson's education might be a point of contention. Legally, the biological parent (husband) is responsible for the children, so he might have the duty to support their education. However, the author is not a legal parent to the stepsons, so expecting her to cover their costs might be unfair.\n\n5. **Emotional Impact**: The author is resentful because the husband brought it up without her, leading to a conflict. The husband might be trying to ensure his sons aren't at a disadvantage, but the way he handled it could be poor communication.\n\nPossible angles: The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to prioritize her own child, especially the promise made. The husband should have discussed the idea with her first. The stepson's situation (living with them now) might imply shared responsibility, but the financial constraint is a real issue. The author's plan to take the ultimatum and have the husband break the news is fair since he initially proposed the idea without her knowledge.\n\nBut some might argue that as a stepmother staying with them, she's part of the family and should contribute to the stepchild's education. However, the original promise was to their daughter, and the husband's sudden suggestion without consulting her is problematic. The author's resentment is valid because of the lack of communication and the financial reality. Her plan is a way to hold the husband accountable for the initial misstep and ensure their daughter's needs are met first, which is reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's approach was flawed in communication, and her response is a logical consequence. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
