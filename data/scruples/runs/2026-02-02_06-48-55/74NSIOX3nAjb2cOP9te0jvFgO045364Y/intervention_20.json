      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given statement is in the wrong. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. AITA stands for \"Am I the Asshole?\" which is a subreddit where people ask if they're being an asshole in a given situation. The author is essentially saying that they want people who are actually being assholes (i.e., the ones at fault) to come forward in these posts, rather than people who are just seeking validation. They claim most posts are NTA (Not the Asshole), meaning the person isn't the one being an asshole.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user is suggesting that the author is in the wrong, so I need to evaluate that. The author's main point is about wanting more genuine cases where the person is actually the asshole, rather than posts where people are just looking for sympathy or validation. \n\nIs the author being dismissive of others' experiences? Maybe. By stating that most posts are NTA, they might be implying that people are not being genuine or that their situations aren't as bad as they think. This could come off as judgmental or invalidating, especially if someone is genuinely seeking help or validation because they feel wronged. \n\nHowever, the author is expressing a preference for the type of content they want to see, not necessarily making a claim about others' validity. But phrasing like \"assholes\" and \"seeking validation\" could be seen as derogatory towards those asking questions. It might also discourage people from sharing their issues if they feel the community is unwelcoming.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're dismissing others' concerns and using harsh language, that could be considered inconsiderate. But if they're just expressing frustration with the current trend of posts and not directly attacking individuals, maybe not. However, the way they phrase it does seem to devalue the experiences of others who are using the forum as intended. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're undermining the purpose of the AITA subreddit, which is to provide a space for people to get honest feedback, regardless of whether the situation seems NTA or not. Dismissing others' posts as just seeking validation could discourage genuine participation and create a hostile environment. So, Answer A (Yes) seems appropriate.\n"
