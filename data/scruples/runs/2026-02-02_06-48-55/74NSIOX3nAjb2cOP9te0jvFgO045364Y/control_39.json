      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given text is in the wrong. The text is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context here. The person is asking if they're the asshole for wanting people who are \"assholes\" to come forward rather than those seeking validation. They mention that many posts are clearly NTA (Not the Asshole) scenarios. \n\nThe phrase \"AITA\" stands for \"Am I the Asshole,\" which is a common subreddit where people ask for community judgment on their actions. In those posts, the community usually determines if the person is the asshole (ITA) or not (NTA). \n\nThe author here seems to be frustrated that many posts are from people who are seeking validation rather than those who are actually the asshole. They want the subreddit to focus on cases where the person is the asshole, not people just wanting reassurance. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. To decide this, I need to assess whether their stance is reasonable. Wanting the subreddit to address actual cases where someone is in the wrong, rather than people seeking validation, could be seen as a reasonable desire. If people are using the subreddit to get validation for their actions, it might dilute the purpose of the forum. \n\nHowever, there's a nuance. The author is dismissing posts that they think are NTA by calling them \"obviously NTA scenarios.\" If they're correct in those judgments, then their frustration is valid. But if they're dismissing valid posts where people genuinely seek advice or have complex situations, then their approach might be problematic. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author is expressing a preference for the subreddit's content, not making a claim about a specific situation. They aren't attacking others but stating their desire for the community to focus on certain types of posts. Unless their comments are disrespectful or invalidating others' experiences, they aren't necessarily in the wrong for having that opinion. \n\nSo, considering that the author is voicing a preference for the subreddit's direction and not directly harming others, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are allowed to want the community to address actual cases of being an asshole rather than validation-seeking posts. Unless they are being dismissive in a harmful way, which the text doesn't show, they aren't in the wrong.\n"
