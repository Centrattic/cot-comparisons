      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong. The original question is \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user wants to know if this is AITA (Am I the Asshole) and whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. AITA posts are usually people asking if they're the asshole in a situation. The author here is complaining that most posts are NTA (Not the Asshole) and that people are seeking validation instead of \"assholes coming forward.\" So the author is suggesting that the current trend of posts is not about actual problems but people just wanting to be validated.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no. \n\nI need to analyze the author's statement. They are criticizing others for not being \"assholes\" and instead seeking validation. The author is expressing frustration that the community might be skewed towards NTA, which could mean that people are not actually in the wrong but are still posting. The author wants more cases where someone is clearly the asshole. \n\nIs the author being an asshole by wanting that? Arguably, the author is just expressing an opinion about the direction of the forum. They aren't directly attacking anyone, just commenting on a trend. However, maybe they're being dismissive of others' valid issues. If people are genuinely seeking help and their situations are NTA, the author might be invalidating their concerns by implying they shouldn't be posted. \n\nBut the AITA community allows for both AITA and NTA responses. The author's frustration might stem from a desire for more content where someone is clearly the jerk. However, that doesn't make them the asshole. The author isn't acting maliciously here; they're just expressing a preference. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong. They're allowed to have that opinion even if others disagree.\n"
