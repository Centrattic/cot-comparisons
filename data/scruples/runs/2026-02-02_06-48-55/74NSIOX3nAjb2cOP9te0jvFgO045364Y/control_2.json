The question is about whether they should be the one at fault (AITA) for wanting people to come forward instead of just seeking validation. The original statement mentions that most posts are obviously NTA (Not The Asshole) scenarios.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The phrase \"AITA\" is from the subreddit r/AmItheAsshole, where users share situations to get others' opinions on whether they're the asshole. The user here is frustrated that many posts they see are clearly NTA, implying that the person isn't the asshole. They want people to actually come forward (maybe meaning to take responsibility or confront issues) rather than just seeking validation for their own perspective.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author of that statement is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nThe author's frustration seems reasonable. If most posts are NTA, they might be annoyed that people are not owning up to their mistakes or not addressing the real issues, just looking for confirmation that they're right. The author's desire for accountability instead of validation isn't inherently wrong. It's a critique of the subreddit's content, not a harmful action. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here. They're expressing an opinion about the community's trends, which is a valid stance. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
