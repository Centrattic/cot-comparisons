The question mentions that most posts are NTA (Not The Asshole) scenarios.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. This seems to be related to online forums where people post about conflicts and the community votes on who's the asshole. The user is frustrated that many situations are clearly NTA, implying that the posters are trying to get validation that they're right, but the community isn't recognizing that. The author wants the actual asshole to be identified, not just validation for the poster.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is wrong for this stance. The author isn't being an asshole themselves but is expressing frustration with the current state of the forum. They're not attacking others but pointing out a pattern they see. So, the author's position is that the forum isn't holding people accountable properly, and they're advocating for more accurate judgments. Since they're not engaging in harmful behavior themselves and are critiquing a system, it's more of a valid opinion than a wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
