      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The original question is \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's going on here. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for wanting people who are actually being jerkish (assholes) to come forward, rather than people just looking for validation. They mention that most posts are NTA (Not the Asshole), which means the people in those scenarios aren't the problem.\n\nSo, the user's situation is that they're frustrated with posts where people aren't actually the asshole but are seeking validation. The author is saying they want the real assholes to come forward, not those seeking validation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nI need to consider the context of AITA posts. Typically, people post to get opinions on whether they're the asshole in a situation. The author is criticizing others for using these platforms to seek validation, implying that the posts aren't genuine cases where someone is actually in the wrong. They want the real AITA cases, where someone is the asshole, rather than people just wanting to feel better.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting authenticity in the posts isn't inherently wrong. However, perhaps the author is being dismissive of others' genuine need for validation, which might not be the main point of the AITA subreddit. The key here is whether the author's stance is valid or if they're being judgmental.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable if they feel the subreddit is being flooded with posts that aren't actually about someone being in the wrong. But does that make them the asshole? It depends on their tone and intent. If they're just expressing a desire for more genuine AITA cases, maybe not. However, if they're belittling others' posts without understanding their perspective, that could be problematic.\n\nIn this case, the author's statement is a bit harsh (\"assholes to actually come forward\"), but their point is about the validity of the posts. Since the user is asking if they're the asshole, the answer would depend on whether their criticism is reasonable. Since the subreddit's purpose is to discuss who is in the wrong, wanting more authentic AITA scenarios isn't wrong. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
