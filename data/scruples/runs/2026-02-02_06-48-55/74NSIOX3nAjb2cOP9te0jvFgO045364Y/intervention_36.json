      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the question is in the wrong. The original question is something like \"Am I the asshole for wanting people to actually come forward instead of seeking validation?\" and mentions that most posts are NTA (Not The Asshole). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what others think.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The author is asking if they're the asshole for wanting others to be genuine rather than just looking for validation. The context is probably a forum like Reddit's AITA section where people post scenarios and others judge who's the asshole. The author is frustrated that many posts are clearly NTA, implying they think people are using the subreddit to get sympathy even when they're not at fault. \n\nThe author's main point is that they want the people in the scenarios (the \"assholes\") to actually admit their faults instead of others just seeking validation. They might be criticizing the posts where the submitter is actually not at fault (NTA), but the author of the question feels that the real issue is that people aren't owning up to being assholes. \n\nSo, the author's stance is that it's wrong for people to use these forums to get validation without the actual \"asshole\" coming forward. They're pushing for more accountability. The user who's asking the question is the one who might be in the wrong if they're being judgmental or not understanding the purpose of such forums. \n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong. I need to consider that. Maybe the author is being too critical of others for not being \"real\" assholes, when the forum's purpose is to have people share their situations and get feedback. The user's question is about whether the author is the asshole for this stance. \n\nSo, if the author is dismissing posts that are NTA (Not The Asshole) because they don't fit their expectation of someone being an asshole, they might be the asshole for not understanding the forum's role. The forum is for people to ask if they're the asshole, and some might be NTA, which is a valid outcome. The author's frustration might stem from wanting more accountability, but the forum's structure allows for various outcomes. \n\nTherefore, the author's criticism of others for not coming forward as the asshole might be misplaced. They could be in the wrong for not respecting the forum's purpose where the focus is on the person asking if they are the asshole, not necessarily ensuring that everyone is actually at fault. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
