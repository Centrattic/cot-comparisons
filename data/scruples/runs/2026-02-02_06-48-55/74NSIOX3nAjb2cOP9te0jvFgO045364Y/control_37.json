      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is at fault.\n\nThe original question says: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The user is on a platform like Reddit where people post \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) questions. In these posts, people describe a situation and ask others if they're the asshole. The community then responds with either \"You're the Asshole\" (YTA), \"Not the Asshole\" (NTA), or other responses.\n\nThe author is saying they're asking if they're the asshole for wanting the actual \"assholes\" (the wrongdoers in the scenario) to come forward, instead of people just seeking validation. They also mention that most posts are NTA, implying that people are often not in the wrong, and the author is frustrated with that trend.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong (A for yes, B for no).\n\nI need to analyze the author's tone and intent. The author is expressing frustration that the AITA posts are not revealing actual wrongdoers (assholes) but instead people are just seeking validation. The author is arguing that the actual wrongdoers should come forward, which could mean they want the person who did something wrong to admit it or be identified. However, in AITA posts, the person posting is usually the one seeking judgment, so if they're the one asking if they're the asshole, they might be the one in question.\n\nBut the author is not the one in the scenario; they're the person posting about others' posts. They're criticizing the trend where the posters are often NTA. The author is not necessarily being an asshole themselves but is expressing an opinion about the community's dynamics.\n\nHowever, the phrasing \"wanting assholes to actually come forward\" might be a bit harsh. The author is suggesting that the people who are actually in the wrong should come forward (i.e., the posters should be the ones who are at fault, not the NTA ones). But if they are not the ones in the scenario but commenting on others' posts, they might not be in the wrong themselves. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being judgmental or dismissive towards others' situations. If they're saying most posts are NTA, they might be implying that people are getting away with being jerks, but since they are not the ones acting in the scenarios, they aren't the ones in the wrong. Their frustration might be valid if they feel the community isn't holding people accountable, but that's their opinion. So, in terms of being an asshole, they aren't directly wrong in the scenario they're posted. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
