      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of a certain statement is in the wrong. The statement is about not wanting people to seek validation and instead have \"assholes\" come forward. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for wanting people to actually confront the issue rather than just getting validation. They mention that most posts are NTA (Not The Asshole), implying that many people are seeking reassurance that they're right. The author is frustrated with this trend and prefers that people who are actually at fault step up.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? The question is whether their stance is justified. The user is considering if the author is wrong for wanting this change. If I were to break it down, the author is expressing a desire for more accountability in these discussions. They want people to address real issues instead of just getting validation. \n\nIs it wrong to want others to take responsibility? If the author is not being confrontational themselves but is expressing frustration with the current state of discussions, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if they're dismissive of others' genuine need for validation in certain situations, that could be problematic. But the statement seems more about their preference rather than attacking others directly. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author is being dismissive or is advocating for a different approach. Since they're asking if they're the AITA, implying they're open to feedback, and their criticism is about the trend of posts rather than individuals, they might not be in the wrong. However, using \"assholes\" could be seen as harsh, but that's part of the language in these forums. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's stance is about wanting a shift in how people approach these situations. They might not be wrong for wanting that change. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
