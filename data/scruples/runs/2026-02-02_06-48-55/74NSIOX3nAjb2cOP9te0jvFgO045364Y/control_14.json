      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong (AITA) for wanting people to come forward instead of seeking validation. The original statement mentions that most posts are NTA (Not The Asshole) scenarios.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is responding to a situation where others are posting about conflicts, possibly seeking validation rather than addressing the actual issue. The author is frustrated that many of these posts are clear NTA, meaning the person is not the asshole. \n\nThe key here is the author's intention. They want people to confront issues directly instead of just seeking validation online. But is that a valid stance? The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding that opinion. \n\nIn AITA threads, people often share their situations to get opinions on their actions. If the author is criticizing others for not taking real action and instead seeking validation through these posts, they might be encouraging a more proactive approach. However, the AITA community is meant for people to get feedback on their own behavior, so if someone is just seeking validation without addressing the conflict, that's a common critique. \n\nThe author isn't making a harmful statement; they're expressing frustration with the trend. There's no direct accusation or harm mentioned here. They're just pointing out a pattern they dislike. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and there's no evidence of malicious intent or harm, the answer would likely be B (No). The author is not in the wrong for wanting people to take action instead of seeking validation.\n"
