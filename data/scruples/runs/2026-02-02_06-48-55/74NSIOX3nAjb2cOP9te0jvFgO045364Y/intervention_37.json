      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the message is in the wrong. The original message says, \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The phrase \"AITA\" stands for \"Am I the Asshole?\" which is a common question on forums where people ask if they did something wrong in a situation. The author is questioning why people are posting NTA (Not the Asshole) scenarios instead of actual \"asshole\" cases where someone is clearly in the wrong. They want people who are the actual assholes to come forward, rather than those seeking validation for their own actions.\n\nSo the author is criticizing the current state of the forum, suggesting that most posts aren't genuine AITA questions but rather NTA ones where the poster is trying to justify their own behavior. The question is whether this author is in the wrong for expressing that opinion.\n\nNow, considering the author's intent. They're not directly attacking anyone but are making a general comment about the forum's content. They might be frustrated with the trend of posts that don't fit the typical AITA mold. Is it wrong to want the forum to have more genuine cases? Or is it just a valid opinion about the platform's usage?\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Maybe because the author is dismissing others' posts as NTA, implying those posters aren't real assholes. But is that judgment fair? The author isn't accusing specific people of being wrong; they're just pointing out a pattern. Unless their tone is hostile, which isn't indicated here, it's a critique of the forum's content direction.\n\nIn online communities, it's common for users to express such sentiments about the types of posts they see. Unless the author is making personal attacks or invalidating others' experiences without cause, their statement is a valid opinion. They're not necessarily in the wrong for wanting the forum to focus on its intended purpose. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any implicit judgment that's problematic.\n"
