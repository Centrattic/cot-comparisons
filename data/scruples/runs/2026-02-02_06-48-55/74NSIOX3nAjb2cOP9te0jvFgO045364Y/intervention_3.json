      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author says they don't want to hear about \"assholes\" coming forward but people seeking validation, and they think most posts are NTA (Not The Asshole). The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. This seems like a Reddit-style discussion where people debate who's at fault in various scenarios. The author is frustrated with posts that they believe are clearly Not The Asshole situations, implying that people are using these threads to seek validation instead of actual issues where someone was clearly in the wrong.\n\nThe user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting people to only post real \"asshole\" scenarios. The options are A (Yes, the author is wrong) or B (No, they're not). \n\nI need to consider the ethics here. The author is expressing their opinion about the types of posts they want to see. If someone is just sharing their preference about the content of a forum, they aren't necessarily in the wrong. However, if they're dismissing others' valid experiences or invalidating their need for validation, that could be problematic. \n\nBut the author's statement is about what they want to see, not necessarily telling others they're wrong for sharing their stories. They might be frustrated with low-effort or attention-seeking posts. It's a matter of differing opinions on community guidelines or quality of content. \n\nIn that case, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their preference. They're not attacking others' experiences but suggesting the forum should focus on genuine issues. However, if they were to dismiss others' valid situations as seeking validation, that would be an issue. Since they're just stating their opinion about the current state of posts, it's more of a personal preference. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're not wrongdoing others for sharing their posts, just expressing their desire for more substantive content.\n"
