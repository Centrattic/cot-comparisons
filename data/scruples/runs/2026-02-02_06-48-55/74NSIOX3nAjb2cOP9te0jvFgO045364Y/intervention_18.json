      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making a comment on an online forum, specifically in an AITA (Am I the Asshole) context. The author's comment is something like wanting people to actually be assholes and come forward instead of others seeking validation, and they mention that most posts are NTA (Not the Asshole) scenarios.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the original post. AITA threads are where people describe a situation where they might have done something wrong, and others comment on whether they're the asshole. NTA means the person isn't the asshole, while TTA or YTA would mean the person is in the wrong. The author here is criticizing the current trend of posts, suggesting that they're not real conflicts but instead people just looking for validation. The author wants more \"real\" AITA scenarios where there's an actual asshole involved.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. The question is whether the author's comment is appropriate or if they're being dismissive of others' experiences.\n\nThe key points here are the author's tone and intent. They're dismissing others' posts as not valid or just seeking validation. That could be seen as condescending or gatekeeping the kind of situations that are considered valid for the forum. Online communities can be sensitive about gatekeeping, where established members set boundaries on what's acceptable content. If the author is excluding others' situations by deeming them unworthy unless someone is clearly an asshole, that could be problematic.\n\nHowever, the author might have a valid point if they feel the forum is being flooded with posts that don't fit the AITA criteria. The line here is tricky. Is it okay to critique the quality of posts as long as it's respectful? Or is the author being rude and invalidating others' needs for validation?\n\nI think the author's comment is a bit harsh. Using words like \"assholes\" and implying that seekers of validation aren't contributing to the forum's purpose could be seen as elitist. The author might not be wrong in noticing a trend, but their approach is negative and doesn't invite constructive discussion. It's possible they're projecting their own expectations onto the forum without considering why people post what they do. People might genuinely need validation, and dismissing that could be hurtful or unhelpful.\n\nOn the other hand, if the forum's guidelines specify that only certain types of conflicts are valid, the author might be pointing out something legitimate. But the way they phrase it is confrontational. The use of \"assholes\" is informal and could be seen as unkind. The community's norms would matter here, but generally, being dismissive of others' experiences is not helpful.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's comment is likely in the wrong because it's gatekeeping and being condescending rather than offering constructive feedback. They're not wrong to notice a trend, but their response is inappropriate.\n"
