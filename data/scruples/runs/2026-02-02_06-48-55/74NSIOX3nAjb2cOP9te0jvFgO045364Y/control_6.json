      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their statement about wanting people to come forward instead of seeking validation. The original question is \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation?\" and the author adds that most posts are obviously NTA (Not The Asshole) scenarios now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. AITA is a subreddit where people ask if they're the asshole in a situation. The user is frustrated that many posts are clearly NTA, implying that the people posting aren't actually the asshole but are seeking validation. The author wants people to be genuine and come forward if they are the asshole, rather than just looking for approval.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). The user wants a binary answer with nothing else.\n\nThe key here is to assess if the author's frustration is justified. The author is criticizing others for not coming forward and being honest about their role in conflicts. If someone is indeed the asshole but denies it, they should be encouraged to own up. However, if the author is dismissing legitimate situations where people are genuinely unsure or seeking advice, that might be problematic. But in this case, the author is expressing a desire for honesty, not dismissing valid cases. \n\nMost AITA posts do involve people being defensive or not owning up. So the author's frustration is understandable. They're not saying they're the asshole, but that others aren't owning up. The author is correct in pointing out that some people might be seeking validation rather than admitting fault. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting people to be honest. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
