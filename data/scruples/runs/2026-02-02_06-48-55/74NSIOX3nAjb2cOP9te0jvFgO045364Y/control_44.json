The text is a question from an \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) scenario where the author is frustrated that people are using the forum for validation rather than genuine cases of being wronged.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. AITA posts typically involve someone sharing a situation and asking if they're the asshole. The community then comments with their opinions. The user here is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting people to actually come forward with real issues instead of just seeking validation. They mention that most posts are obviously Not The Asshole (NTA) scenarios, implying that people aren't being genuine.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nThe author is expressing frustration with the current state of AITA posts, not making a claim about their own behavior. They're not acting out; they're commenting on the behavior of others. Since they're not doing anything wrong themselves but are instead criticizing others' misuse of the forum, they aren't in the wrong. The key here is that the author isn't engaging in any harmful behavior; they're just expressing an opinion about the forum's content. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
