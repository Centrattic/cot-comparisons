      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given statement is in the wrong. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user wants to know if the answer is A (Yes, they're wrong) or B (No, they're not).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The question is about whether the author is at fault. The original statement seems to be from a forum like Reddit's AITA (Am I the Asshole) where people post their dilemmas. The author is criticizing the current posts as being non-NTA (Not the Asshole) scenarios and wants people to actually be \"assholes\" in their posts rather than seeking validation.\n\nNow, the key here is to determine if wanting others to be more confrontational or honest in their posts is wrong. The author is expressing frustration that most posts are not genuine NTA cases. They want more people to come forward as the actual \"assholes\" instead of just seeking validation. \n\nIs the author being judgmental or setting an unrealistic expectation? If they're suggesting that people should be more direct in their posts, maybe they're not wrong. However, if they're dismissing others' genuine situations, that could be problematic. The statement itself is a meta-commentary on the forum's content, so the author's intent is to encourage more authentic posts. \n\nSince the author isn't directly causing harm but is expressing an opinion about the forum's content, they might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B (No). Unless there's a specific rule violated, but the question is about moral wrongness, not technical rules.\n"
