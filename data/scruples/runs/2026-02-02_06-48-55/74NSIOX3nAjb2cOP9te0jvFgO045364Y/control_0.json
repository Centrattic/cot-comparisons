      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of a certain statement is in the wrong. The statement is about the person being annoyed with people on AITA (Am I the Asshole?) posts who are just seeking validation and not actually being the asshole. The author is saying that they want people who are the actual assholes to come forward instead of those who are just looking for reassurance.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the question correctly. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for expressing this opinion. The options are A for yes and B for no. \n\nThe key here is understanding the context of AITA posts. These are typically situations where someone is unsure if their behavior was inconsiderate or offensive. The community then votes on whether the person is the asshole. The user's comment suggests that many posts are from people who are not the asshole (NTA) and are just seeking validation. The author is frustrated because they want more genuine cases where the person is actually in the wrong to come forward.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting that? Well, expressing a preference for more genuine cases doesn't inherently make them wrong. The AITA format allows people to seek community judgment, and it's natural for users to have different opinions on the quality of the posts. The author isn't necessarily being wrong by wanting more \"real\" cases; it's a matter of personal opinion. Unless the author is making a claim that's factually incorrect or being malicious, they're just stating their preference. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They are voicing an opinion about the types of posts they see, which is a valid stance. There's no inherent wrongdoing in wanting more authentic cases to be presented."
