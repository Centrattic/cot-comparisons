      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their statement about wanting people to come forward instead of seeking validation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The original post says, \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The author is expressing frustration that many posts are NTA (Not The Asshole), implying they think the people in the scenarios aren't at fault, but they want the \"assholes\" to actually come forward. So, the author is questioning if it's their fault (AITA) for wanting people who are actually in the wrong to come forward instead of those who are just seeking validation.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. They asked to answer A if the author is wrong, B if not.\n\nNow, analyzing the situation. The author is making a generalization that most posts are NTA, which could be dismissive of others' experiences. By wanting the \"assholes\" to come forward, they might be implying that people shouldn't seek validation unless they're clearly the asshole. This could be seen as invalidating people's feelings and experiences, suggesting that only certain cases are valid. That's a problem because everyone deserves to be heard, even if their situation isn't black-and-white. The author's tone is also confrontational, using words like \"assholes\" and implying that others are just seeking validation, which can be disrespectful.\n\nHowever, the author isn't necessarily saying they don't want help, but they want the community to focus on real issues. But the way they phrase it might come off as dismissive. The key point is whether the author's stance is wrong. If the community is supposed to be a place for people to seek advice and validation, then telling people they shouldn't seek validation unless they're clearly in the wrong could be harmful. It's possible the author is projecting their own expectations onto others.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's approach might be invalidating others' experiences and setting an unrealistic standard for when validation is appropriate. That makes them in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
