      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given text is in the wrong. The text says, \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user wants a choice between A (Yes, the author is wrong) or B (No, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The question is in the style of an \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) subreddit, where people ask if they're the asshole in a situation. The original poster here is asking if they're the asshole for wanting people who are actually \"assholes\" to come forward, rather than those seeking validation. They mention that many posts are \"obviously NTA\" (Not the Asshole).\n\nThe key here is the author's tone and intent. By saying they want \"assholes\" to come forward, they might be implying that only the people who are genuinely in the wrong should be in the discussion, not those who are just looking for sympathy or validation. The question is whether this is a valid stance or if it's dismissive or rude.\n\nI should consider if the author is being dismissive of others' experiences by labeling them as seeking validation. However, the author isn't attacking anyone personally but is making a general statement about the types of posts they see. The phrase \"obviously NTA scenarios\" suggests they believe many posts are not actually about being the asshole, which might be their way of filtering what they consider valid AITA questions.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for making that comment? Well, if they're expressing frustration at the types of posts they see, that's their opinion, but they might be invalidating others' genuine concerns by dismissing them as seeking validation. However, without more context, it's hard to say if they're being intentionally harmful. The question is whether their statement is in the wrong.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often values perspective and understanding. If the author is being dismissive without reason, that could be seen as problematic. However, if they're just sharing their opinion on the types of posts they prefer to see, it's a matter of personal preference. The answer might lean towards B (Not wrong) if it's their opinion, but A if it's being judgmental. However, the line between opinion and judgment can be blurry here.\n"
