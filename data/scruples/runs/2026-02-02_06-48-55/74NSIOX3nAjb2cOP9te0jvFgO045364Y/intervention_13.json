      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given statement is in the wrong. The statement says, \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. AITA stands for \"Am I the Asshole?\" where people ask for community judgment on their situation. NTA is \"Not the Asshole,\" meaning the person isn't at fault. The author is questioning if they're wrong for wanting actual \"assholes\" to come forward instead of people who are just seeking validation. They also mention that most posts are NTA scenarios now.\n\nSo the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for this opinion. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). I need to determine if the author's stance is being critical of the community in a way that's inappropriate.\n\nThe author is expressing frustration that many AITA posts are NTA, implying that the posters are seeking validation rather than genuine conflict. They want the \"real\" assholes to come forward. But is this a valid critique or is it dismissive of others' experiences?\n\nIn the AITA context, every post is a person seeking advice, and whether they are the asshole is subjective. The author's frustration might stem from a perception that some posters are not genuine. However, dismissing people's situations as seeking validation could be seen as invalidating their need for help, even if the scenarios aren't as contentious as others. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If their comment discourages people from posting real issues under the guise of wanting more severe cases, that could be problematic. However, it's also a valid opinion to have about the community's content. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. \n\nThe original user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider if the author is being inconsiderate or gatekeeping the community. By wanting only \"real\" assholes, they might be setting an unrealistic standard and dismissing others' valid concerns. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes), as the author is in the wrong for invalidating others' posts by implying they're seeking validation instead of engaging with their issues. However, some might argue it's just an opinion. But in the context of a community where people seek judgment, gatekeeping could discourage participation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
