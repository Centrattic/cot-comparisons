      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given statement. The statement is from someone asking if they're \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) for wanting people to come forward as actual assholes instead of people just seeking validation. They mention that most posts are NTA (Not the Asshole) scenarios now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context of the AITA subreddit. It's a place where people share stories and ask if they're the asshole. Typically, the community votes to decide if the person is the asshole or not. The user is frustrated that many posts are NTA, meaning the person sharing isn't the asshole, but they want more people to actually be the asshole (i.e., more clear-cut cases where the person is wrong) instead of just seeking validation. \n\nThe author's complaint is that they want more genuine cases where someone is an asshole, rather than people using the forum to feel validated. So, is the author in the wrong for feeling this way? \n\nFrom a perspective, the AITA subreddit might rely on users sharing their experiences, even if they're not the asshole. The purpose is to get feedback and validation. If the author is criticizing others for seeking validation, maybe they're misunderstanding the purpose. However, maybe there's a sense that too many posts are from people who are clearly not in the wrong but are just looking for affirmation, which can skew the community's experience.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's stance is that they want more actual cases where someone is the asshole. They're not necessarily being asshole themselves by expressing that opinion. They're stating a preference for the content of the subreddit. Unless they're attacking others or being dismissive, just expressing a frustration with the current trend might not make them the asshole. \n\nIt could be a matter of differing opinions on what the subreddit should focus on. The user might feel the platform is becoming less useful because of too many NTA posts, but others might see it as a place for validation and support. The key is whether the author's comment is harmful or dismissive. Since they're just expressing a preference without attacking others, it's likely they're not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
