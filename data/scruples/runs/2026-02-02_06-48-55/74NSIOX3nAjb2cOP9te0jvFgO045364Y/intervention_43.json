      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given statement is in the wrong. The statement is: \"AITA For wanting assholes to actually come forward here instead of people seeking validation? Most of these posts are just obviously NTA scenarios at the moment.\" The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. AITA stands for \"Am I the Asshole?\" which is a subreddit where people post stories and ask others to judge if they're the asshole. NTA means \"Not the Asshole.\" The author here is complaining that most posts are NTA, meaning the people posting aren't actually the problem, but they're still seeking validation. The author wants more \"assholes\" to come forward, implying that they want more people who are clearly in the wrong to post, so others can get the validation they seek.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user says they think the author is wrong, but they want to know if I agree. \n\nThe key points here are about the author's frustration with the AITA subreddit's content. The author is expressing a desire for more posts where the person is actually the asshole, rather than the other way around. But is that a valid stance? \n\nWell, the AITA subreddit is meant to be a place where people can get honest feedback. If someone is genuinely unsure if they're the asshole, they post their story. The author's comment seems to be more about the community's perception of posts being too often NTA. But does wanting more \"real\" asshole posts make the author in the wrong?\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They are expressing a preference for the subreddit's content, which is subjective. People might have different opinions on what makes a good AITA post. The author isn't invalidating others' posts or being harmful; they're just sharing their perspective. However, there's a nuance here. The AITA subreddit relies on people being honest about their situations, whether they are the asshole or not. If the author is discouraging people from posting when they are NTA, that could be problematic. But the statement doesn't explicitly do that. They just want more posts where the person is actually the asshole, which isn't inherently wrong. So, maybe the answer is B.\n"
