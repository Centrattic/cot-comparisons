Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for what they did with their roommate. The setup is that three people moved into an apartment with three rooms\u2014two smaller and one 40% bigger. The author, X, and Y are the roommates.\n\nSo, before moving in, the author and Y discussed who would take the big room. X didn't care, Y wanted it. The author wanted it too. They tried to decide by random.org, the author won. Then, after three days, Y changed his mind and wanted the big room. The author agreed to let Y have it if Y paid $30 extra each month to the author. Now, X is upset because he feels the author is getting a better deal, paying $30 less while he's in a smaller room.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong. Let's look at the key points. The initial agreement was to use a random number generator, which the author won. Then, Y wanted to trade after the fact. The author allowed that trade with a monthly payment. But the issue is that X wasn't part of these discussions. X didn't care initially, but now he's upset because he thinks the author and Y are colluding to his disadvantage.\n\nSo, the main question is: Was the author wrong to make a separate agreement with Y without consulting X? The original setup was three people sharing rent. The big room's cost might be higher, but the author's arrangement with Y involves Y paying $30 extra to the author. However, if the total rent is split equally among three, maybe the author is effectively getting a discount unless that $30 is adjusted in the overall split. But the problem here is that X isn't included in this agreement. \n\nIf the author and Y made a private agreement that affects the rent distribution without involving X, that could be unfair. Because X is paying his share as per the original arrangement, not considering the $30. So X is effectively subsidizing the author's reduced rent. That might not be fair from X's perspective.\n\nAnother angle: when they moved in, they might have agreed on splitting the total rent equally. If the big room is more valuable, maybe the author should have considered splitting the rent based on room size. But the author tried to handle it with a random selection, which X didn't care about. Then, when Y wanted to switch, the author allowed it with a side payment. However, if the side payment isn't part of the overall rent split, X is paying the same while the author is getting a discount. That's where X's anger comes from.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not adjusting the overall rent division to account for the room size differences and not including X in the decision-making process. By allowing Y to pay extra to the author instead of adjusting the total rent among all three, it creates an imbalance where X is subsidizing the deal. Therefore, the author should have considered the impact on X and possibly involved him in the agreement to redistribute the rent fairly among all three roommates.\n"
