Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about roommates splitting an apartment with three bedrooms. The big room is 40% bigger, and there's a conflict over who gets it.\n\nInitially, the author and their roommates (X and Y) decide to use a random generator to pick who gets the big room. The author wins. Then, three days later, Y asks to swap, and the author agrees on the condition that Y pays $30 extra each month. X is upset because he feels the author is getting a better deal.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault here. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the initial agreement was a random selection, which seems fair. The author won, so they got the big room. Then Y comes along and wants to swap. The author is willing to give up the room but wants $30/month from Y. The problem arises because X feels left out and that the arrangement isn't fair since he's paying the same as Y but in a smaller room.\n\nNow, considering roommate agreements, typically, unless there's a prior agreement about how rooms are assigned and how rent is divided, each roommate might expect to contribute equally. In this case, the author and Y made a private agreement about the rent difference. X wasn't part of that discussion, which might be why he's upset. The issue could be whether the author should have involved X in the decision, especially if the rent adjustment affects the overall rent distribution.\n\nIf the original agreement was that everyone pays equal rent regardless of room size, then having one person pay more for a bigger room might disrupt that. The author might be in the wrong by not getting X's consent or at least explaining the arrangement. However, if X agreed to the initial random selection and the rent was always meant to be equal, then the author's adjustment could be seen as unfair. But if the room size difference justifies a different rent split, then maybe it's okay.\n\nAnother angle is that the author and Y made a mutual agreement, and X wasn't part of the negotiation. The fact that X feels left out might be the real issue. The author might be in the wrong for not including X in the discussion, leading to resentment. Alternatively, if the original agreement allowed for room swaps with rent adjustments, then it's valid.\n\nIn many roommate situations, when rooms are different in size, it's common to adjust the rent accordingly. However, if the initial agreement didn't specify that, then the author's action might be seen as changing the terms without consulting all parties. Since X wasn't involved in the swap agreement, he's now paying the same as Y but in a smaller room, which he perceives as unfair.\n\nSo, the key points are: the initial selection was fair, the swap agreement between author and Y wasn't communicated to X, leading to X's discontent. The author might be in the wrong for not involving X in the decision and for creating a disparity in rent without consensus. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
