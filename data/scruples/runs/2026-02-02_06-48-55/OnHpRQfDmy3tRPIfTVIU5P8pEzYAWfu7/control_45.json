Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about roommates deciding who gets the bigger room. Initially, the author, X, and Y moved in. The big room was decided by a random number generator, and the author won. Then Y wanted it again and the author agreed to let him have it if he paid $30 more each month. Now X is upset because the author is paying less rent even though he has the same size room as X.\n\nFirst, the initial decision was a random draw. That seems fair because both the author and Y wanted the big room, and they used a neutral method. The author got it through that process. But then Y came back after three days and offered money to swap. The author agreed to the $30 monthly payment. So the agreement between the author and Y is a mutual consent. \n\nNow X is angry because he didn't get involved in that negotiation. He's paying the same rent as the author, but the author is getting a discount because of the deal with Y. The problem here is whether the author had the right to make that deal without consulting X. \n\nIf the original rent split was based on room sizes, then the author's room is bigger than X's, so maybe the rent should reflect that. But if the rent was split equally among all three regardless of room size, then the author is effectively getting a bigger room for the same price, which might be unfair to X. However, the author made a deal with Y where Y is paying extra. So the total rent paid by all three might still add up the same, just with Y paying more to the author each month. \n\nBut the key point is whether the initial agreement about the room assignments and rent was clear. If the room assignments were supposed to be based on the random draw and rent was split equally, then the author changing the arrangement without involving X could be seen as unfair. X might feel that the rent should be adjusted based on room size, and since the author is in the bigger room, they should pay more. However, since the author is getting money from Y, maybe the total is balanced out. \n\nAnother angle: when Y wanted to swap, the author could have involved X in the decision. Since all three are roommates, any changes affecting the overall living arrangement or finances should be discussed with everyone. The author didn't do that, which might have caused X's anger. So even though the deal between the author and Y is fair between them, not including X in the process is a problem. \n\nSo the answer hinges on whether the initial agreement allowed for such a swap without consensus from all roommates. If the original agreement was that room assignments would be fixed once decided, then the author might be wrong to change it without everyone's input. But if the agreement was flexible, then the author is in the right. However, typically in roommate situations, any changes that affect rent or room assignments should be discussed with all parties. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not involving X in the decision, even if the deal with Y is fair between them. However, if the rent structure accounts for the $30 from Y, then maybe it's balanced. But X's perspective is that he's paying the same as the author for a smaller room, which is the core of his complaint. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not involving X in the negotiation. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
