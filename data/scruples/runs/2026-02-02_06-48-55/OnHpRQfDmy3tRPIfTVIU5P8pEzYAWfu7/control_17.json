Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about roommates and splitting rent, specifically the bigger room. The author moved in with two others, X and Y. Before moving in, they had a discussion about who gets the bigger room. Initially, the author and Y wanted it, and they had a random draw because Y thought a bid might be unfair due to income differences. The author won the random draw and got the big room.\n\nThen, after three days, Y asked to swap, and the author agreed to let Y have the room if Y paid $30 extra each month. Now, X is upset because he's paying the same rent as the author but the author is paying $30 less total. X claims the author is scamming him by getting a cheaper rent for a bigger room.\n\nSo the question is, is the author at fault here? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the initial arrangement: they used a random generator to decide who gets the big room. That seems fair, right? Both wanted it, and they agreed on a random method. The author won, so they had the big room. Then Y later wanted to switch, and they negotiated a deal where Y would pay $30 more to take the room. The author is now paying $30 less than Y, but X is upset because he's not part of that deal and feels it's unfair.\n\nNow, the key points here are about fairness and agreements. When the author and Y made the deal, did they consider X's input? The author said they discussed it with Y, not X. But X is the one who is upset because he's paying the same as the author but the author is getting a cheaper rent. So, is X's complaint valid?\n\nIn roommate situations, typically, when rooms are of different sizes, it's common to have different rent splits. So if the big room is worth more, the person in it might pay more. However, in this case, the initial agreement was that everyone was supposed to pay the same rent, but then the author and Y made a private agreement where Y pays more. That could lead to imbalance because X is still paying the same as the author, but the author's room is bigger but they're paying less. Wait, no\u2014the author is in the bigger room but paying less? Wait, if the original rent is split equally, but then Y offers to pay $30 more to the author to take the big room. So the total rent for the apartment is the same, but Y is effectively paying more than the others. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nAssuming the total rent is split among the three. If the author was originally in the big room and paying their share. Then Y takes the big room and pays the author $30/month. But how does that affect the overall rent split? If the total rent is fixed, then each person's share would be based on the original split. If the author and Y made a private agreement where Y gives the author $30, that might be a side deal, but X is not involved in that. So X is still paying his original share, while the author is receiving $30 from Y. But if the author is in a bigger room, does that mean the author should be paying more? If the original agreement was equal split, but the author got a bigger room for the same price, then maybe that's unfair to the others. However, in this case, the author gave up the big room to Y in exchange for $30. So Y is in the bigger room and pays the author $30. But how does that affect the overall rent? If the total rent is the same, then Y is effectively paying more than the others. Let's say the total rent is, for example, $900/month. If each was supposed to pay $300, but Y is paying $300 to the landlord plus $30 to the author. So Y is paying $330 total, while X and the author are paying $300 each. But the author is now in a smaller room. Wait, the author gave up the big room to Y, so the author is in a smaller room. So the author's room is smaller, but they're still getting $30 from Y. Wait, that might complicate things. So the author is in a smaller room but receives $30 from Y. X is in a smaller room, paying $300. Y is in the big room, paying $330 total. So the author is getting $30 from Y, so their net payment is $270. But maybe the original agreement was that everyone pays $300. So the author is actually being subsidized by Y, which would mean that X is still paying $300, but the author is getting $30 from Y. That seems like the author is effectively paying less. But why is X upset? Because he's paying the same as the author, but the author is getting a discount? But the author isn't necessarily getting a discount; they're in a smaller room. The author is still paying their original share, but Y is paying extra to take the bigger room. Wait, maybe the confusion is that X is comparing himself to the author. X is in a smaller room and pays $300, while the author is in a smaller room but gets $30 from Y, so their net payment is $270. But the author is in a smaller room, so maybe the value of the room is lower, hence the lower rent. But if the original agreement was to split the rent equally regardless of room size, then maybe the author's arrangement with Y skews that. But if the author and Y made a private deal, does that affect X? \n\nThe problem here is that the author and Y made a side agreement that changed the rent distribution without involving X. If the original arrangement was that all three split the rent equally, then the author receiving $30 from Y would mean that the author is effectively paying less than the others. X is paying the same as before, while the author is getting a discount. That would be unfair to X because now the author is getting a better deal. However, if the original arrangement allowed for different rent based on room size, then maybe this is okay. But the initial setup was a random draw for the big room, and the author won it. Then Y wanted to switch, and they negotiated a deal. If the deal was that Y would pay more for the bigger room, then maybe that's fair. However, if the total rent is split equally among all three, but Y is paying the author $30, that complicates the original split. \n\nAnother angle: If the author and Y made a private agreement where Y pays the author $30 to take the room, that's essentially a room exchange with a monetary adjustment. If the rooms are different in size, it's common for the person in the bigger room to pay more. But in this case, the author was in the bigger room and then gave it up for $30. Now Y is in the bigger room and paying the author. But if the original rent was split equally, then Y's $30 would be a personal payment, not part of the overall rent. So the total rent paid by each person would be: X pays his share, Y pays his share plus $30 to the author, and the author pays their share minus $30. That would mean Y is paying more in total, which is fair if he's in the bigger room. X is paying the same as the author, but the author is in a smaller room. However, if X is in a smaller room and paying the same as the author, who is also in a smaller room but getting $30 from Y, then X might feel that the author is getting an unfair advantage. But actually, the author is in a room of equal size to X's, but the author's net payment is less because Y is paying the author. So X is paying the same as the author, but the author's effective rent is lower. That's the crux of X's complaint. \n\nIs that fair? It depends on the original agreement. If the original agreement was that rent is split equally regardless of room size, then the author receiving money from Y would disrupt that. However, if the author and Y made a side deal, and X wasn't part of it, then X's complaint is about the fairness of the overall rent split. The author might argue that it's a private agreement between them and Y, but X is affected because the author's effective rent is lower. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the original arrangement allowed for such side deals. If the three roommates had an agreement that rent is split equally and rooms are assigned randomly, then the author's deal with Y changes the dynamics without consulting X. X might feel that the author is getting an unfair benefit by receiving $30 from Y, which effectively lowers the author's rent compared to X's. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not considering the overall fairness to X. \n\nAlternatively, if it's a private agreement between two roommates, and the total rent to the landlord remains the same, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But X is upset because he's paying the same as the author, who is getting a discount. The author's action led to an unequal distribution of effective rent, which X finds unfair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the impact on X's share of the rent. \n\nAnother point: When Y asked to switch, the author had the right to the room via the random draw. So the author could have refused, but they agreed to the deal. That's their right. But if the deal affects the rent split, which in turn affects X, then the author should have involved X in the discussion. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they made a deal with Y that altered the rent distribution without considering X's perspective, leading to an unfair situation where the author effectively pays less rent than X for the same room size. However, if the original agreement allowed for room-based rent, then maybe not. But since the initial setup was a random draw for room assignment with equal rent, the side deal complicates things. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
