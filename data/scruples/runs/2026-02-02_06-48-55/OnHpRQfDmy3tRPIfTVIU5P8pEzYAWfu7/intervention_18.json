Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for taking money from their roommate to switch rooms. So the setup is that there are three roommates, two smaller rooms and one bigger. Initially, they had a random draw, and the author got the big room. Then after three days, the other roommate, Y, wanted it and offered to pay $30/month extra for it. The author agreed, so now Y has the big room and pays more. But X is mad because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. The author and Y decided to flip a coin (random.org) to determine who gets the big room. The author won. Then, after three days, Y wanted to switch, and they agreed on a $30/month payment. So the author is getting $30 from Y to move into the big room. But X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the initial arrangement was between the author and Y. X didn't participate in the original decision. The problem is that X feels like he's being treated unfairly. The author didn't involve X in the decision, and now X is paying more rent but in a smaller room. \n\nBut wait, the original question is about whether the author is scamming their roommate. The roommate in question here is Y, who agreed to pay the $30. X is not part of that agreement. However, the issue is that the total rent might be split equally among all three roommates, so if the author is paying less because Y is covering part of their rent, then X is effectively paying more. So the author is getting an advantage by taking money from Y, which affects X. \n\nBut is that the author's fault? The author and Y made a private agreement. If the room assignments and rent splits were agreed upon among all roommates, then maybe the author should have involved X. However, in this case, the room switch was between the author and Y. The author might have thought it was a personal arrangement, but since X is now paying more rent as a result, maybe the author should have discussed it with X. \n\nThe key point is whether the total rent is split equally. If the apartment's total rent is divided equally (each paying 1/3), then when Y gives $30 to the author, effectively, the author is paying less (say $290 instead of $320), and Y is effectively paying $350 (original $320 plus $30), while X is still paying $320. But maybe the roommates had agreed that the big room comes with a higher rent, which in this case, the author and Y arranged. However, if the original agreement was to split the rent equally regardless of room size, then the author's arrangement with Y is causing X to pay more. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their private arrangement with Y affects X. Even though they didn't involve X in the initial decision, the outcome is that X is now in a worse position. The author's solution benefits themselves and Y but leaves X feeling cheated. Therefore, the author should have discussed the room arrangement and any financial arrangements with all roommates to ensure fairness. \n\nIn many roommate situations, it's common practice to split the rent based on room size unless everyone agrees otherwise. By allowing Y to pay extra to get the bigger room, the author is effectively creating an unequal arrangement without consulting X. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering X's position and for creating an unfair distribution of costs.\n"
