Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates and the allocation of a bigger room.\n\nFirst, the setup: three roommates, three rooms. The big room is 40% bigger. The author, X, and Y moved in. Initially, there was a contest to decide who gets the big room, which the author won via random.org. But after three days, Y wanted the room and offered to pay $30 extra each month to the author to swap. The author agreed, so Y took the big room and the author started collecting $30 from Y. Now, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is effectively paying less rent. X thinks the author is scamming him by keeping the smaller room and not paying his share. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. \n\nFirst, the initial allocation: the author and Y decided to use a random method because Y didn't want to bid due to income disparity. The author won. Then, after Y wanted to trade, the author agreed to let Y have the big room if Y paid $30 extra. The author is now getting that $30, so effectively paying less than the others. \n\nNow, X wasn't part of the initial agreement. The problem is that X feels left out and that the author is unfairly reducing his rent. But in most roommate situations, unless there's a formal agreement about room assignments and rent, people often split rent equally regardless of room size unless they agree otherwise. \n\nHere, the author and Y made a private agreement to transfer the big room in exchange for $30. The author isn't necessarily scamming anyone because the agreement was between them. However, the issue is that X is not part of that agreement and feels it's unfair. The author could be in the wrong if the total rent paid by each roommate isn't adjusted properly. For example, if the total monthly rent is split equally, but the author is receiving $30 from Y, then the author is effectively paying less than others. That could be seen as unfair to X, who is paying the same as Y but in a smaller room. \n\nBut if the agreement is that Y pays an extra $30 to the author to compensate for the bigger room, then the total each person pays would be: Y pays original share plus $30, the author pays original share minus $30. However, if the original rent split was equal, then this would mean the author is paying less. But if the total rent is still the same (the $30 is a transfer between roommates), then X is paying the same as before. The problem is that X didn't agree to this arrangement and now feels it's unfair. \n\nIn roommate situations, it's important to have agreements that are transparent and agreed upon by all parties. If the author and Y made a private deal without X's consent, it's possible that X feels excluded and the setup isn't fair to him. However, unless there was a prior agreement that room assignments affect rent splits, the author's action might be seen as a private arrangement. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key here is if the total rent each person pays is adjusted. If the author is effectively paying less than the others because of the $30 from Y, then the arrangement is causing an imbalance. However, the author's argument is that the bigger room's value is being compensated by Y's extra payment. \n\nBut maybe the problem is that the author isn't sharing the $30 with X. If the original rent split was equal, and now Y is paying $30 to the author, then the author's share is reduced by $30. But X is paying the same. So X is paying more per square meter than Y. That could be seen as unfair. \n\nIn terms of legal or standard roommate practices, typically, if one person is getting a bigger room, they might pay more, but the total rent is usually adjusted so that everyone's total payment reflects the room size. However, in this case, the author and Y made a side deal without considering X's feelings. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because the arrangement isn't fair to X, who is now paying a larger share relative to his room size. The author didn't get X's consent, and the arrangement creates an imbalance in the rent split. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the private agreement between the author and Y is causing an unfair situation for X, and the author should have involved X in the agreement to ensure everyone's rent is split fairly based on room sizes.\n"
