Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about roommates and dividing the rent based on room size. The apartment has three rooms: two smaller and one bigger. The author, X, and Y are roommates. Before moving in, Y wanted the big room, and the author also wanted it. They decided to use a random number generator, and the author won. Then, after three days, Y wanted to switch and offered to pay $30 more per month so the author could move to a smaller room. The author agreed. Now, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is effectively paying less rent because Y is covering $30 of the author's share.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author did something wrong. Let's break it down. Initially, they used a fair method (a random generator) to decide who gets the big room. The author got it. Then Y comes back and offers to pay more to switch. The author accepts. But X is upset because he feels it's unfair that the author is paying less than him. \n\nNow, the key points here are: Was there an agreement among all roommates about how the rent would be split? The original premise was that the big room might be decided via a bid or random selection. The author and Y decided on a payment arrangement to switch rooms. However, X wasn't part of this negotiation. If the original agreement was that the big room would be decided between everyone, but instead, two roommates made a private deal, that could be a problem. \n\nRoommate agreements usually require transparency and mutual agreement. If the author and Y made a side deal that affects X's rent payment, especially without his consent, that could be seen as unfair. X might feel that the rent distribution isn't equitable anymore because now the author is paying less. If all three had agreed on a certain method of splitting rent (like equal shares regardless of room size or adjusted based on square footage), changing that without everyone's input is problematic.\n\nHowever, if the original arrangement was that each person could choose their room via random or bid, and the author won the big room, then they had the right to keep it. But when Y offered to pay more to switch, maybe the author was within their rights to accept that offer. The issue is whether the author should have discussed this with X beforehand. If the arrangement between the author and Y affects X's share of the rent, then X has a valid grievance because the total rent is likely split among all three. If Y is paying an extra $30 to the author, that might mean the author's portion of the total rent is effectively lower, while X's remains the same. This could create an imbalance that wasn't agreed upon by all parties.\n\nIn roommate situations, it's generally important to have all parties agree on the terms. If the author and Y made a deal without consulting X, and it results in unequal contributions without everyone's consent, that could be considered unfair. X is entitled to feel upset if the financial arrangement is now unequal without his agreement. The author might have acted in their own interest, but not considering the impact on X's feelings and the overall fairness of the situation. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't ensure that the new arrangement was acceptable to all roommates. Even if the initial decision was fair, changing it without consensus can lead to conflicts. The answer would likely be that the author is at least partially responsible for not involving X in the decision, making the answer A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to make sure I didn't miss any details. The original problem didn't mention if the rent was split equally or adjusted based on room size. If the total rent was split equally, then the author is effectively getting a discount by taking the bigger room, which might be unfair. However, if the rent was already adjusted so that the bigger room costs more, then the author's initial win was based on that. But in this case, the author and Y made a private deal that changes the dynamics without X's input. So, yes, the author is in the wrong for not getting X's agreement on the new arrangement.\n"
