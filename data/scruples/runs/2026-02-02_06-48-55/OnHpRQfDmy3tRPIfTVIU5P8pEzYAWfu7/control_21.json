Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. The scenario involves roommates splitting an apartment with three rooms, where the bigger room is 40% larger. Initially, there was a discussion about who gets the big room. The author and roommate Y both wanted it. Y didn't want a bidding war due to income differences, so they used a random.org roll, which the author won. Then after three days, Y wanted the room back and offered to pay $30/month for it, which the author accepted. Now, roommate X is upset that the author is paying less rent for a smaller room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. When they moved in, the big room was assigned via a random draw after Y didn't want a bidding war. The author then gave up the room to Y for an extra $30/month, which Y agreed to. The key points here are whether the initial agreement was fair and if the subsequent change was properly communicated to all parties.\n\nRoommate X is the one who didn't care about the big room initially. The author and Y made a private agreement without involving X. The problem arises because X feels the arrangement is unfair because he's paying the same rent for a smaller room. But X didn't participate in the initial decision to give the big room to the author or Y. However, when Y took over the big room, the author is now receiving $30 less rent. This could imply that the total rent isn't being split equally among all three, which might be an issue if the rent is supposed to be divided by room size or equally.\n\nIn many roommate setups, rent is split equally unless otherwise agreed. However, if the rooms are different in size, sometimes people adjust the rent accordingly. The original problem was that the big room was assigned via a roll, and then the author and Y made a private deal. The issue now is that X is upset because he's paying the same as the author, even though the author isn't using the big room anymore. If the total rent is split equally, but the big room's value is accounted for through the $30, that might not be fair to X. Alternatively, if the original agreement was to split rent based on room size, but Y is paying the author $30, that could also be a problem.\n\nAnother angle is that the author and Y made a private agreement without including X. If the original setup was a verbal agreement where rooms are assigned via roll, and then a separate arrangement for the big room, X might not have been aware of the $30 deal. This could lead to X feeling excluded or that the deal isn't fair. However, if the total rent is split equally, and the $30 is just a private payment between the author and Y, it might be okay. But if the $30 is part of the overall rent structure, then maybe not.\n\nThe key here is whether the agreement between the author and Y affects X's share of the rent. If the total rent is split equally among all three, but the author is getting $30 from Y, then the author is effectively paying $30 less than X. This could mean that X is paying more than his fair share, especially if the big room's value is supposed to be accounted for. However, if the original agreement was to split rent equally regardless of room size, then the author and Y's deal could be unfair to X because it's creating an imbalance in their payments.\n\nAlternatively, if the total rent is split based on room size, and the author and Y's deal is to adjust the rent between themselves, that might be acceptable. But since X didn't agree to any of this, he might not be aware of the adjustments. The problem is that the author didn't involve X in the decision to transfer the big room and adjust payments. So X's argument is that the author is taking advantage by getting a better deal without considering the equal split.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the initial arrangement was a random assignment, but then a private deal was made without consulting everyone, it's possible that the author is in the wrong because they didn't include X in the decision-making process. Roommate agreements should ideally be clear to all parties involved. The $30 payment might be a way for Y to get the big room without affecting the total rent, but if that's not transparent to X, it could be seen as unfair.\n\nHowever, if all roommates agreed to split rent equally regardless of room size, then the author and Y's deal to transfer the room by paying $30 might be their way of adjusting for the room's value. In that case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're compensating Y for the bigger room. But if X is paying the same rent and feels it's unfair that the author is getting a discount, then maybe the initial setup was flawed.\n\nUltimately, the main issue is transparency and communication. The author and Y made a private agreement without involving X, leading to X feeling wronged. The fact that X didn't care about the big room initially doesn't mean he's not affected by the financial arrangement now. The answer depends on whether the agreement was fair to all parties and if the author acted in good faith. Since the author didn't consult X, it could be seen as the author being in the wrong.\n"
