Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about roommates dividing up a bigger room. The apartment has three rooms, one bigger than the others. The author, X, and Y are roommates. Initially, they decided to use a random number generator to assign the big room, which the author won. Then Y, who wanted the big room, asked if he could swap by paying $30 extra each month. The author agreed, so Y pays the author $30 a month to take the big room.\n\nNow, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less, essentially getting a discount by receiving $30 from Y. X thinks the author is scamming him. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. They used a random number generator to decide who gets the big room. The author won, so by that agreement, they were supposed to get the big room. But then Y wanted to swap. The author offered a deal: if Y pays $30 a month, he can have the big room. Both Y and the author agreed to this. So there's a private agreement between them. \n\nBut X wasn't part of this agreement. He might feel that the arrangement is unfair because he's in a smaller room and the author is getting money, which makes his rent lower. Wait, actually, the author is getting $30 from Y. Does that mean the author is paying less to the landlord, and keeping the $30 from Y? Or is the author passing that $30 on to X?\n\nThe problem here is that the initial decision to assign the big room was between the author and Y. X didn't have a say. Maybe X feels that the arrangement should have been more inclusive. But in typical roommate situations, unless there's a prior agreement that all roommates must be consulted for any room swaps, individual roommates can agree among themselves. However, if the total rent is split equally, then taking money from one roommate to give to another might affect others.\n\nWait, in the scenario, when the author says \"you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" So, if the total rent is split equally, but the author is getting $30 from Y, that would mean the author's share is less. But maybe the original rent split wasn't adjusted. For example, if the total rent is $1000, each pays $333.33. If the author is in the big room, but then Y swaps, pays $30 to the author. So Y ends up paying $363.33 (original $333.33 plus $30), while the author is only paying $303.33 (original minus $30). Then X is still paying $333.33. So X is paying the same as before, but Y is paying more. So X isn't being scammed; he's just in a smaller room. But maybe X feels that the author should have split the $30 with him, but that's not necessarily the case. The agreement was between Y and the author.\n\nBut another angle: if the room assignments affect the rent split, then maybe all roommates should agree. If the original agreement was that everyone pays equal rent, and then the author and Y make a side deal, that could be unfair to X. Because now the author is effectively getting less rent (since they're getting $30 from Y), so the total rent isn't being split equally anymore. But if the total amount to the landlord is the same, then the author is keeping the $30 as extra, which might be against the original agreement of equal split. For example, if all three are supposed to pay the same, then any side deals could disrupt that. Alternatively, if the total rent is split as per the original agreement, then the author's $30 from Y is on top of that, so the total paid to the landlord is the same. In that case, X's payment isn't affected, but the author is receiving money from Y, which might be seen as unfair if the original arrangement was supposed to be equal in terms of room value.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the original rent was split based on room sizes. If the big room is worth more, then the original random assignment might have been fair, but when the author gives up the big room for money, the author is effectively charging Y for the room's value, which could be acceptable if all parties agree. However, if the total rent isn't adjusted to reflect the room's value, then maybe the author is profiting from the swap, which could be contentious.\n\nAnother point: when they used random.org, the author won the big room. Then Y wanted to swap, and they agreed on $30/month. That's a mutual agreement. Unless there was a prior agreement that any changes require all three roommates' consent, the author and Y could make their own deal. However, if the arrangement affects the rent split in a way that's not agreed upon by all, then X might be justified in feeling wronged.\n\nSo the key factors are:\n\n1. Were there prior agreements about room assignments and rent splitting? If the original agreement was that everyone would pay equal rent regardless of room size, then the author's deal with Y could be violating that, making the author at fault.\n\n2. If the rent was split such that the big room comes with a higher share of the rent, then the author's deal with Y might not be fair if it's not adjusted accordingly. But if the original agreement was equal rent, then taking $30 from Y for a room swap without adjusting the total rent split could be seen as unfair to X.\n\n3. The problem is that X wasn't part of the agreement. If the author and Y made a deal that affects the overall fairness for X, then X's complaint is valid. The author might be in the wrong if the deal disrupts the original agreement or creates an unequal rent burden without X's consent.\n\nIn many roommate situations, when room sizes differ, the rent is split proportionally. If they didn't do that, and instead split the rent equally, then swapping rooms without adjusting the rent could be an issue. Since the author is effectively getting a discount by taking money from Y, while X's room is smaller but rent is the same, X has a valid point.\n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because the deal with Y created an unequal distribution of rent burden without involving X. The initial agreement to use random.org was between the author and Y, but when Y wanted to swap, the author should have considered X's potential feelings or included him in the decision.\n"
