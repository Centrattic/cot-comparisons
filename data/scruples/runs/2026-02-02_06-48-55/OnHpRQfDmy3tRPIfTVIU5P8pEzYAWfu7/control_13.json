Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for \"scamming\" their roommate. The situation is about room assignments and money.\n\nFirst, the setup: three roommates. The apartment has three bedrooms, with one being 40% bigger. Initially, the author (let's call them Z) and Y both wanted the big room. X didn't care. They used a random generator, Z won, and took the big room. Then Y came back after three days and wanted the room, offering to pay $30 extra a month. Z agreed to let Y have the room in exchange for that money. Now X is upset because Z and Y have the same size rooms but Z pays less rent.\n\nHmm. The main issue is whether Z was wrong in accepting $30 from Y. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, when they moved in, the agreement was a random selection. Z won, so they took the big room. Then Y wanted the room and proposed a deal. Z agreed to transfer the room to Y in exchange for $30/month. That seems like a private agreement between Z and Y. But X is now upset because he thinks the rent should be equal, but Z is paying less. \n\nBut wait, the original rent arrangement wasn't specified. Did they all split the rent equally? If the apartment's total rent is divided equally among three people, then each pays 1/3. But if Z is now giving $30 of their share to Y, that would mean Y is effectively paying more. However, if the original agreement was that everyone pays the same, then Z's arrangement could be seen as unfair to X. \n\nBut the problem is, the author made a deal with Y after the initial random selection. If the room assignment was supposed to be fixed by the random generator, then changing it later could be a problem. However, rooms can be traded if all parties agree. But in this case, Z and Y made a deal without involving X. \n\nX's argument is that it's unfair because he and Z have the same size rooms but Z pays $30 less. But the deal between Z and Y is about Z getting $30 from Y. If the total rent is split equally, then Z is effectively giving up part of their share to Y. But maybe the original agreement was that each room's rent is based on size. If the big room is worth more, then the rent should be higher. However, if the total rent is fixed, then splitting it based on room size would require adjusting individual shares. \n\nBut the original scenario doesn't mention a room-based rent split. It just says they moved in and used random.org. If the rent was split equally regardless of room size, then Z's deal with Y could be considered unfair to X, because Z is now receiving money from Y, which effectively means Y is paying more. But if the room size difference justifies a different rent, then maybe Z and Y's arrangement is fair. \n\nBut the problem is that X wasn't involved in the agreement. The author and Y made a deal without considering X's input. However, X's complaint is that the rent distribution is unfair. So, if the total rent is being split equally, but Z is getting $30 from Y, then effectively Y is paying more than Z, but X is paying the same as Z. That creates an imbalance. However, if the rooms are different sizes, maybe the rent should reflect that. \n\nBut in the initial setup, they used a random method to assign the big room. Now, Y is paying Z to have the big room. But if the total rent is fixed, Z is getting $30 from Y, which is essentially a transfer between roommates. However, if the original agreement was that everyone pays equal rent regardless of room size, then Z's arrangement is violating that. \n\nAlternatively, if the room size affects the rent, then the person in the bigger room should pay more. If the original setup didn't account for that, maybe the deal between Z and Y is a way to adjust for that. However, if X was not part of the agreement, he might feel left out. \n\nThe key point is whether the deal between Z and Y was done without consulting X, but if the deal only affects Z and Y, and X's room size and rent remain the same, then maybe it's not his issue. However, if the total rent is split equally, then Z is effectively reducing their own share by getting $30 from Y, which would mean Y is paying more than his equal share. But if the room is bigger, maybe that's justified. \n\nBut the problem is that the original agreement (random selection) was about room assignment. The deal to transfer the room for money is a subsequent agreement. If X wasn't part of that, but their rent is still split equally, then X might feel he's paying the same as Z, even though Z is in a smaller room. Wait, no\u2014Z gave up the big room to Y. So Z is in a smaller room, Y is in the big room. So Z is in a smaller room but paying $30 less. X is in a smaller room and pays the same as Z. Wait, the user says that after the deal, Y gets the big room, so Z is in a small room. Then X and Z are both in small rooms, but Z is paying $30 less. \n\nIf the original rent was split equally, then each pays the same. But Z is getting $30 from Y, which would mean Y is effectively paying $30 more per month than his equal share. But since Y is in the bigger room, maybe that's fair. However, X is in a small room and pays the same as Z. But Z is getting $30 from Y, which might mean that the total amount Y is paying is higher. However, if the total rent is fixed, then the $30 is an internal transfer between Z and Y, and X isn't involved. \n\nThe problem from X's perspective is that he's in a small room and pays the same as Z, who is also in a small room. Wait, no\u2014Z is in a small room, so X and Z are both in small rooms. But Z is paying less than X. Because Z is getting $30 from Y. So Z's effective rent is reduced by $30, while Y's is increased by $30. X is paying the same as before. So X is paying the same as Z, but Z is in the same room size as him but pays less. Therefore, X feels that Z is taking advantage. \n\nBut the deal was between Z and Y. X wasn't part of it. If the original agreement was that everyone pays equal rent regardless of room size, then Z's arrangement might be violating that. However, if the room size should affect the rent, and there's no prior agreement about that, then Z and Y's deal is a way to adjust for the room difference. However, since the deal affects the rent Z is paying (by getting $30 from Y), it might create an imbalance with X. \n\nThe key question is whether the room size should influence individual rent. If the apartment's rent is split equally, then room size is not a factor. But if the room size is a factor, the rent should be adjusted accordingly. \n\nIn this case, the initial assignment was random, but the deal between Z and Y effectively changes the room assignment and creates a different rent structure without considering X's input. However, X wasn't part of the deal. So, if the original rent was split equally, Z's arrangement with Y creates a situation where Z is effectively paying less than X, which X finds unfair. \n\nSo, the author might be at fault for not considering X's perspective when making the deal. Even though the deal was between Z and Y, the effect on X's perception of fairness could be significant. However, if the deal is a private arrangement and the total rent is still split equally among all three, then Z is just transferring part of their share to Y, which might be acceptable. \n\nBut since the user is asking if they're in the wrong, the answer depends on whether the deal was done fairly and transparently. If the deal was done without informing X, but it doesn't affect X's rent or room size, then maybe not. However, since X is now upset because of the perceived unfairness, the author might have a responsibility to address it. \n\nIn conclusion, the author made a separate agreement with Y without considering X's potential feelings. Since the deal affects the distribution of rent in a way that makes X feel shortchanged, the author might be at fault for not involving X in the decision. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
