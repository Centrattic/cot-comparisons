Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author did something wrong by charging a roommate $30 a month for the bigger room. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: Three roommates in an apartment with three bedrooms. One room is 40% bigger. When they moved in, the author wanted the bigger room. The roommate Y also wanted it but couldn't afford to pay more, so they flipped a coin using random.org, and the author won. Then, three days later, Y asked to switch if he paid the author $30 a month. The author agreed, and now the other roommate X is upset because he feels the author is getting a better deal and is scamming him.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author had the right to charge Y for switching rooms without considering X's input. Let's consider the initial agreement. When they moved in, the author and Y decided via a random method who would get the big room. The author won, so they took the big room. Then, after some time, Y wanted to switch and offered to pay $30/month. The author agreed. But X wasn't part of that decision and now feels his share is being altered.\n\nNow, the key points to consider are: Did the three roommates agree on a system for room assignments and rent? The initial agreement between the author and Y was a random selection, which is fair if all parties agreed to it. However, when Y wanted to switch, the author made a new arrangement without involving X. If the original agreement was only between the author and Y, then maybe the author had the right to negotiate a switch with Y. But if X was part of the original agreement (even if he didn't care initially), then maybe the author should have included him in the new arrangement.\n\nAnother angle: When the author and Y made the switch, did they affect X's rights? If the rent is split equally among all three, and the author is now getting $30 from Y, effectively reducing the author's share by $30 and possibly increasing X's by $30, that might be unfair to X. But if the original agreement was that everyone pays equal rent, and the author is now getting a personal payment, it's possible that X feels his rent is effectively higher because the author isn't paying their full share.\n\nAlso, the term \"scamming\" might be too strong here. The author didn't hide anything from Y, and Y agreed to the $30 payment. However, the issue arises because X wasn't part of that negotiation. If the room assignments and any additional payments weren't discussed with all parties, X might feel that the arrangement is unfair to him.\n\nIn roommate situations, it's usually best to have a clear agreement that everyone is aware of. If the initial agreement was only between the author and Y, then the author isn't necessarily wrong for negotiating a switch with Y. However, if X was part of the original agreement (even if he didn't care about the big room), then the author should have included him in the decision-making process to avoid resentment.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not considering how the new arrangement affects X, even if the original agreement was between two people. By making a deal with Y without involving X, the author created a situation where X feels he's paying more relative to the author. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not addressing X's concerns upfront and ensuring a fair distribution of rent and room assignments for all parties.\n"
