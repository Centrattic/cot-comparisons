Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about room assignments and rent splitting.\n\nFirst, the apartment has three rooms: one big and two smaller. The author and two roommates, X and Y, moved in. Before moving, they discussed who gets the big room. The author wanted it, Y also wanted it. Y didn't want a bidding war because of income differences, so they flipped a coin (using random.org), and the author won. Then, after three days, Y asked to switch, and the author agreed to let Y have the big room if Y pays $30 extra each month. Now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less rent, thinking the author is scamming him.\n\nSo the main issue is whether the author's arrangement with Y is fair. Let's break it down. Initially, they decided the big room via a random draw. Then Y wanted to switch, and they made a deal: Y pays $30 more to take the big room. But X wasn't part of that deal and feels left out. \n\nThe key points here are: Was the initial agreement fair? The author didn't force anyone; they agreed to a random draw. Then, when Y wanted to switch, they made a mutual agreement. The author didn't scam anyone; they negotiated a fair price based on the room's value. However, X is upset because he wasn't part of the negotiation. \n\nBut wait, the problem is that the rent split might not be proportional to the room sizes. If all three are splitting rent equally, but the big room is 40% larger, maybe the rent should be split differently. However, the author and Y made a private agreement where Y pays extra to the author. So from the landlord's perspective, the rent might still be split equally, but the author is getting $30 from Y. That's a side agreement between roommates. \n\nIs that allowed? If the lease is split equally among all three, then the author might be creating an unfair internal arrangement that affects X. X is paying the same as the author, even though the author is effectively getting a bigger room minus $30. But since X wasn't part of the negotiation, he might feel left out. \n\nBut legally, the author and Y can make a private agreement as long as the landlord isn't involved. So the author isn't doing anything illegal. However, ethically, maybe X wasn't considered in the decision. The original problem is that X didn't care who got the big room, but he seems to care now. Maybe the author should have discussed it with all three to find a fair split. \n\nBut the author only had to make a decision with Y after the initial draw. Since X didn't have preferences, maybe he didn't need to be involved in the subsequent agreement. However, the fact that X is now upset because of the unequal financial burden might be a problem. The author is effectively getting more value than X, but since he's in a smaller room, maybe the $30 isn't enough to compensate for the bigger room. \n\nAlternatively, if the rent is split equally, but the author is getting an extra $30 from Y, that makes the author's effective rent lower than X's. So from X's perspective, he's paying the same as the author but not getting any extra money. That's why he's upset. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't necessarily in the wrong legally, ethically, maybe there's a problem because the arrangement affects X without his consent. However, since X didn't initially care about the room assignment, the author's actions might be justified. But since X is now upset, maybe the author should have considered a different approach. But according to the story, X didn't have a preference before, so the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
