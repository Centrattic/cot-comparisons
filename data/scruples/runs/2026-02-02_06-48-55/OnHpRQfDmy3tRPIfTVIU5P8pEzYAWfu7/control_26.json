Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about roommates and the allocation of the bigger room.\n\nFirst, the setup: Three people moved in together. Two smaller rooms and one bigger. The bigger room was up for grabs. The writer and Y wanted it. They initially tried to flip a coin but Y didn't think it was fair because the writer had a higher income. So they randomized and the writer got it. Then after three days, Y wanted to trade, so the writer agreed that if Y paid an extra $30 each month, he could have the big room. Now X is upset because he's paying more per square meter, even though he has a smaller room.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the writer is in the wrong for taking the $30. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, when they first tried to decide the big room, X didn't care. So maybe X didn't have a strong claim. The writer and Y sorted it out between themselves. Then Y wanted to switch, and the writer offered a financial arrangement. X only has an issue now because he's paying more per square meter. But the initial agreement was between the writer and Y. Did X agree to this arrangement? It seems like he didn't. The writer didn't consult X when making the deal with Y.\n\nBut the problem is that all three share the same rent. So if the writer is getting $30 from Y, that effectively reduces the writer's share of the rent. If X is paying the same as the writer, but the writer is getting an extra $30, then from X's perspective, it's unfair because he's paying more per square meter. The problem is that the initial agreement between the writer and Y might have affected X's situation without his consent.\n\nSo, is the writer allowed to do that? Roommate agreements can be tricky. If the three of them didn't have a prior agreement about how to handle room size and rent, then the writer making a deal with Y might have created an imbalance. X could argue that the overall rent division should be adjusted based on room sizes. But since they didn't discuss it, the writer might have acted unilaterally.\n\nAnother angle: When Y offered to pay $30 to switch rooms, does that affect X's share? If the total rent is split equally among three, and the writer is getting $30 from Y, effectively the writer's net cost is lowered. X is paying the same as the writer, but X's room is smaller. So X feels he's paying more per square meter. The writer might see it as a private arrangement between them, but X is part of the total agreement.\n\nIn some cases, all roommates need to agree on how rent is divided. The writer's deal with Y might have changed the dynamics without considering X's input. So X is upset because the fairness of the rent division is now affected. The writer might be in the wrong for not addressing this with X, especially since the arrangement impacts everyone's payment structure.\n\nBut then again, maybe the writer and Y are in a private agreement. However, since all three are paying the same total rent, the deal between writer and Y changes the per-person cost. So X's complaint is valid. The writer should have considered that. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the writer is in the wrong) because they didn't get X's agreement on the rent split when making the deal. The initial arrangement was between two people, but it affects the third's payment fairness.\n"
