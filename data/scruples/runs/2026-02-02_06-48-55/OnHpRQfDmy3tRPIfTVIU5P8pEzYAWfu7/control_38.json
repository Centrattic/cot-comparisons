Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates and the allocation of a bigger bedroom. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: Three roommates moving into an apartment with three bedrooms. The big room is 40% bigger. Initially, the author wanted the big room. Their roommate Y also wanted it. They discussed options like random selection or paying extra. Y thought it wasn't fair because the author has a higher income, so they went with a random.org roll. The author won.\n\nThen, after three days, Y wanted to switch and offered to pay $30/month to the author to take the big room. The author agreed, so Y pays the author $30 each month. Now, roommate X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less rent. X feels scammed and is angry.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about fairness and agreements. The initial agreement was that the big room was assigned randomly. The author and Y then made a private agreement where Y pays the author to switch. But X wasn't part of that. X is in a smaller room and not involved in the negotiation. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Let's consider roommate dynamics. Typically, when splitting rent among roommates, if someone is in a larger room, they might pay more. The original arrangement was supposed to be equal, but the author and Y made a side deal. However, X wasn't part of that. The problem is that the total rent the roommates are paying as a group might be split equally, but the individual shares might not account for room sizes. \n\nWait, the story says the apartment has three bedrooms. The author is in the big room, Y moved into the big room after the swap, but the author is getting $30 from Y. Wait, no, the author originally won the big room, then Y paid them $30 to take it. So the author is now in a smaller room, but getting $30 from Y. Wait, no, the author says after the swap, Y is in the big room. The author is in a smaller room. But the author is getting $30 from Y. So the author's total rent is effectively less by $30 because Y is paying them. But how does that affect X? If the three roommates are splitting the total rent equally, but the author is getting $30 from Y, then the author is paying less than the others. But X is paying the same as the original split. \n\nBut maybe the initial rent split wasn't adjusted for room sizes. The author and Y's agreement might be a private arrangement where Y is compensating the author for the larger room. If the total rent is split equally, then Y is effectively paying more because they have the bigger room. However, if the author is getting $30 from Y, that could mean the author is paying less to the landlord. But does that affect X? If the landlord's total rent is split equally, then X is paying the same as before, but the author is getting money from Y, which might make X feel like the author is profiting\u4e0d\u516c\u5e73ly. \n\nThe problem is that X wasn't involved in the agreement. The author and Y made a private deal, but the original arrangement was supposed to be a random selection to assign the big room. By allowing Y to buy out their spot, the author is creating an unequal distribution of costs that X isn't part of. \n\nIn roommate situations, fairness is usually about all parties being on board with the arrangement. If the original agreement was that the big room is assigned fairly (randomly), then changing that without consulting everyone could be an issue. However, the author and Y might have made a mutual agreement. But X's argument is that he's being treated unfairly because he's in a smaller room and paying the same as the author. \n\nBut the original problem was that the author and Y both wanted the big room. The author went through a fair process (random.org) and then allowed Y to buy out their spot. If the total rent paid to the landlord is the same, but the author is receiving $30 from Y, that would effectively lower the author's share. However, if the split was supposed to be equal, then X is paying more in total. \n\nWait, maybe the roommates split the rent equally regardless of room size. If the author is in a smaller room but getting $30 from Y, that means the author's total contribution is less. X is in a smaller room and paying the same as before. So from X's perspective, he's in a smaller room and paying the same as the author who is getting money. That's why X is upset. \n\nIs that fair? It's complicated. Roommate agreements can be tricky. If the original idea was that the big room comes with a higher rent, then the author and Y's arrangement might not account for that. Alternatively, if the total rent is split equally, but Y is compensating the author for the larger room, then it's a private agreement between two roommates. However, X isn't part of that and feels left out. \n\nThe main issue is that the author made a deal with Y without considering X's input. If the original agreement was that the big room is assigned randomly, and then the author allows Y to pay to take it, maybe X should have been involved in the process. But since X didn't participate in the initial decision to assign the big room randomly, maybe he can't complain now. However, the financial aspect\u2014Y paying $30 to the author\u2014creates a situation where the author is effectively paying less than X, which might not be fair in X's eyes. \n\nIn roommate situations, it's usually best to have all roommates agree on how the rent is split and how rooms are assigned. Since the author and Y made a private agreement that affects the overall fairness from X's perspective, maybe the author is in the wrong for not involving X in the financial arrangement. Alternatively, it's possible that the financial arrangement is just between the two, and X's grievance is unfounded if the total rent to the landlord remains the same. \n\nWait, if Y is paying $30 to the author, does that mean the author is paying $30 less to the landlord? Or is it a side payment between Y and the author? If the total rent paid to the apartment is the same, and it's split equally, then the author is getting an extra $30, which they didn't earn. That would be unfair to X. But if the total rent is adjusted so that Y pays more, then it's different. \n\nThe story doesn't specify how the rent is split. The initial setup says they moved in with two acquaintances. If the rent is split equally, and Y is paying the author $30/month, then the author's net cost is lower. X is in a smaller room and paying the same as the author, who is getting money. That's probably why X is upset. \n\nIn that case, the author is benefiting financially from the arrangement, which might not be fair to X. However, the author and Y agreed on the swap. If the author is just getting a side payment, maybe that's not part of the original rent split. But X's problem is that he's not in the same position. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the room assignment and payment were supposed to be equal, then making a private deal that creates an imbalance could be unfair. However, roommates can agree on different terms as long as all parties consent. Since X wasn't part of the agreement, maybe his objection is valid. \n\nAlternatively, if the author and Y's agreement is a private matter and doesn't affect the total amount paid to the landlord, then it's a side deal and X's issue is about his own room size, which he might have accepted when moving in. \n\nThis is a bit of a toss-up. Depending on how the rent is handled, the author might be in the wrong for not considering X's perspective. But if the author and Y agreed, and the total payment to the landlord remains the same, maybe it's not the author's fault. \n\nBut the key point is that X is upset because he's paying the same as the author, who is getting money from Y. That creates an unequal distribution of costs from X's viewpoint. If the author is effectively paying less than X because of the $30 from Y, then X is right to be upset. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they allowed an unequal arrangement that affects the fairness from X's perspective without consulting him. So the answer would be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
