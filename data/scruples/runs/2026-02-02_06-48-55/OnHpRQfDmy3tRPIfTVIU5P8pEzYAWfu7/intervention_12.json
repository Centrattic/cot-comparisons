Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. The situation involves roommates dividing up the bigger bedroom in an apartment. The author (let's call them Z) moved in with two others, X and Y. They decided to use a random number generator to assign the big room, which Z won. Then Y wanted to switch and offered to pay $30 extra each month for Z to switch. Z agreed, leading to X being upset because he feels it's unfair that Z pays less.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the initial agreement. When they moved in, all three agreed to a random assignment. Z won the big room. Then Y came back three days later and wanted to change it. Z allowed the switch but required Y to pay $30/month. The problem now is that X is upset because Z is effectively paying less than him.\n\nThe key points here are consent and transparency. Did X know about the initial random assignment and the subsequent switch? The author mentioned that before moving in, they asked X and Y who wanted the big room. X didn't care, Y wanted it. Then the random generator was used. So the initial allocation was agreed upon by all three. Then Y wanted to switch, and Z agreed to the switch with a payment. But X wasn't part of that negotiation. \n\nNow, X is upset because he feels Z is getting an unfair advantage by paying less. But the initial agreement was for all three to split the rent equally, but with Z giving up the big room in exchange for $30 from Y. So effectively, Y is paying Z $30/month to take the smaller room, which means Y's total rent is higher. However, X is not involved in this arrangement. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main argument against the author is that X wasn't consulted in the switch, leading to an unequal distribution of rent. However, if the original agreement allowed for room assignments to be changed with mutual consent between the involved parties, then Z and Y could have made that arrangement without needing X's approval. However, if the initial agreement was that rent would be divided equally, and the room assignments were part of the initial agreement, then changing it later without consulting all roommates might be problematic. \n\nBut in this case, the initial agreement was a random assignment. After that, Y approached Z to switch, and they made a private deal. The issue arises because X wasn't part of that deal and now feels that Z is benefiting unfairly. However, if the room assignments are part of the lease agreement and can be adjusted between roommates as long as all parties involved agree, then Z isn't necessarily in the wrong. But if the lease requires that any changes to room assignments or rent must have all roommates' approval, then Z might be in the wrong for not getting X's consent.\n\nAnother angle is that the initial agreement included all three roommates, and changing the room assignments without consulting all might be against the original agreement. The original agreement stated that they would assign the big room via random.org, which all three agreed to. After that, Y wanted to switch, and Z agreed. If the initial agreement didn't allow for such switches, then Z and Y might have overstepped. However, if it's an open agreement that room assignments can be changed with mutual consent, then it's okay. \n\nBut X wasn't involved in the switch, so he might feel that his consent was needed. If the original agreement was that the room assignments could only be changed with all three agreeing, then Z is in the wrong. However, if the agreement was that each roommate could assign their room as they see fit, then Z and Y's arrangement is valid. \n\nAlso, the fact that Y was willing to pay $30 to switch rooms suggests that Z is not scamming but rather making a fair trade. However, the issue is that X is now paying the same as Z, but Z is in a better room, leading to X feeling it's unfair. The problem here is that the payment between Y and Z doesn't affect X, but X's rent is the same as Z's. However, if the original lease was a flat split, then the private payment between Y and Z is a separate arrangement. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions depend on the original agreement. If the initial agreement allowed for room changes with consent between parties, then it's okay. If not, then maybe not. But since X wasn't part of the switch, he might feel left out. However, if the payment arrangement is between Y and Z, then X's payment isn't affected. The problem is that X is paying the same as Z but in a smaller room. But if the initial agreement was that room size affects rent, then the payment from Y to Z is fair. However, if the agreement was equal rent regardless of room size, then Z might be in the wrong for creating an unequal payment arrangement without X's knowledge.\n\nBut the original agreement was to assign the big room via random.org. After that, Y wanted to switch, and Z agreed. If the rent was supposed to be split equally, then Z's arrangement with Y is a private matter. However, X's complaint is that Z is paying less than him. Wait, no\u2014Z is paying the same as X, but Y is paying Z $30/month, so effectively Y is paying more in total. X is not paying anything extra. So Z's rent is the same as X's, but Y's rent is higher. Therefore, X is not paying more, but he's in a smaller room. The issue is that X feels that because Z is in the bigger room (originally) and then later switches, but in the end, Z is in a smaller room while getting a $30 discount. Wait, no\u2014Z gave up the big room to Y in exchange for $30. So Z is in a smaller room but gets $30 from Y each month. X is in a smaller room and pays the same. So X's complaint is that Z is getting a better deal by paying less even though they're in a smaller room. But X is also in a smaller room and pays the same. So the problem is that X is upset because Z is in the same size room as X but pays less, which isn't the case. Wait, no\u2014Z gave up the big room to Y, so Z is in a smaller room. Y is in the big room and pays $30 more. X is in a smaller room and pays the same. So Z is in a smaller room but gets $30/month from Y. So effectively, Y is paying more to be in the big room, and Z is getting a discount. X is in the same size room as Z and pays the same. So X is upset because he's in a smaller room but pays the same as Z, but Z is in the same size room and pays the same. Wait, maybe X is confused. If X is in a smaller room and Z is in a smaller room, but Z gets $30 from Y, then Z's situation is better because they have the same room size as X but earn $30. So X's complaint is that Z is getting money from Y, which is not part of the original rent split. Therefore, the problem is that X feels that the arrangement between Y and Z is unfair because it affects the perceived value of their own room. However, if the original agreement was that rent is split equally, then the private arrangement between Y and Z doesn't affect X's rent. So X's complaint is more about the fairness of the room assignment and the fact that Z is getting money from Y. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the initial random assignment was agreed upon by all, and then Y wanted to switch, and Z agreed, then Z isn't in the wrong for making a private agreement with Y. However, if the original agreement required consensus for any room changes, then Z might be in the wrong for not getting X's approval. But since X didn't care initially, maybe the initial agreement was acceptable. The problem is that X later feels it's unfair. But if the initial agreement allowed for room changes with mutual consent, then Z's action is okay. If not, then maybe not. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the initial agreement allowed for room changes without all parties' consent. If the original agreement was a one-time random assignment, then changing it later without consulting all might be against the agreement. However, if the agreement was that room assignments could be adjusted as needed with consent between the involved parties, then Z is okay. \n\nAnother point is that X was not involved in the switch, but he's now upset. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider X's potential feelings or involve him in the decision, even though he initially didn't care. But since X didn't care, maybe it's not necessary. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they made a mutual agreement with Y to switch rooms and received compensation. However, if the original agreement required all parties' consent for any changes, then the author might be in the wrong. Since the original agreement was a one-time random assignment without provisions for future changes, the author's action could be seen as fair. But X's complaint is about the unfairness of the rent distribution, which is a separate issue. Therefore, the answer depends on the original agreement's terms. Since the original agreement didn't specify that, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
