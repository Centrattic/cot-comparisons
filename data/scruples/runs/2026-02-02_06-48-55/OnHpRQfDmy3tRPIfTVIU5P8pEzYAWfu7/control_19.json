Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about roommates and assigning the bigger room.\n\nFirst, the setup: Three roommates, three rooms. The big room is 40% bigger. Initially, they had a random draw because both the person (let's call them Z) and Y wanted the big room. Z won. Then after three days, Y wanted it and offered to pay $30/month extra for it. Z agreed to switch if Y paid that amount. Now X is upset because Z is paying less rent than X for the same-sized room.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness in roommate agreements. When they moved in, X didn't care about the room size, so he didn't participate in the initial decision. Then, Z and Y made an agreement without involving X. X is now angry because he feels the rent is unfair.\n\nIn roommate situations, typically, if the rent is split equally, but the rooms are different sizes, people usually adjust the rent accordingly. So maybe they should have had an agreement where the bigger room costs more. The original problem was how the big room was assigned. \n\nThe initial random draw seems fair. Then, when Y wanted to switch, they made a private agreement. But X wasn't part of that. X is paying the same as Z, even though Z is in a bigger room. Wait, no\u2014Z is in the big room initially but then switches with Y. Wait, no, after the agreement, Y is in the big room and paying $30 extra to Z. Wait, the original rent is split three ways, but Z is getting $30 from Y each month. So Z's share of the rent is effectively reduced by $30, while X is paying the same. So X is paying the same as before, but Z is getting a financial benefit from Y. That's probably why X is upset. He's not getting any extra money for his room, while Z is.\n\nSo the question is: Is it fair for Z to accept money from Y to switch rooms, thereby reducing Z's rent? But actually, the total rent is split equally among all three, right? So if the total rent is, say, $1500, each pays $500. But if Z is getting $30 from Y monthly, then effectively, Z's net cost is $470, while X is still paying $500. That's unfair to X because he didn't get any compensation. \n\nBut the problem is that the original agreement was between Z and Y. X wasn't part of that. However, in a shared living arrangement, if room assignments affect rent splits, all roommates should be involved. So by making a private agreement, Z and Y created an unequal distribution that affects X. \n\nSo, maybe the author is at fault for not involving X in the decision. Even though X didn't care initially, the financial arrangement now affects him indirectly. The author is allowing Y to pay more for a bigger room without adjusting the overall rent split. Therefore, the author should have considered X's position. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author isn't at fault because the agreement was between Z and Y, and X's room size hasn't changed. But if the total rent is split equally, then X is subsidizing Z's benefit. That's probably the issue here. \n\nIn many roommate situations, when rooms are of different sizes, the rent is adjusted. If Z and Y made a side agreement without adjusting the overall rent split, then X is paying more for his room than Z. So the author is in the wrong because they didn't account for X's share. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
