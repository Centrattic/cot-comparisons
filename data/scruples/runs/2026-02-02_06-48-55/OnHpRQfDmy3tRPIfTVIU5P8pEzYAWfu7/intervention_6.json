Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a roommate situation. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nSo, three roommates moving into an apartment with three bedrooms. The big room is 40% bigger. Initially, the author (let's call them Z) and Y both want the big room. X doesn't care. They decide to flip a coin via random.org, and Z wins. Then, after three days, Y comes back saying they need the big room for their bed and offers to pay $30/month for it. Z agrees, so Y takes the big room and Z pays $30 less.\n\nNow X is upset because he's in a smaller room and Z is paying less. X claims Z is scamming him. The question is whether Z is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the initial allocation was done fairly with a random number generator, which is a common way to decide such things. Then, Y wanted to change the arrangement by offering to pay extra. Since both Z and Y agreed to the new arrangement, it seems like a mutual agreement. However, X wasn't part of that negotiation. The issue is whether Z should have included X in the decision-making process.\n\nThe key point here is fairness from X's perspective. X is in a smaller room and paying the same rent as Z, who is in a medium room but paying less. But wait, Z is in a medium room? Wait no: Wait, the big room was taken by Y, so Z was originally in the big room, then gave it up to Y for $30. So Z is now in a medium room, and Y is in the big room. X is in the other medium room. So Z is in a medium room and paying $30 less. X is in a medium room paying the same as before. But maybe the rent was split equally before? If the total rent was split equally among three, then each pays 1/3. But if Z is now paying $30 less, that would mean Y is paying $30 extra. But how does that affect X? If the total rent remains the same, then maybe the $30 is an adjustment between Z and Y. So X's payment isn't changing. Wait, but perhaps the original rent was split equally, and now Z is paying $30 less, so Y is effectively paying $30 more. But X is still paying his original share. So X might feel that Z is getting an advantage, but maybe that's not the case.\n\nBut the problem is that X wasn't part of the agreement. X didn't have a say in the initial room assignment, and then the author made a deal with Y without consulting X. That's where X's anger comes from. He feels that the deal made between Z and Y affects him because he's now in the same room size as Z but Z is paying less. But maybe the rent per person isn't directly tied to the room size unless the roommates agreed on a different system. If the original agreement was equal split, then Z's deal with Y changes that. Maybe X feels that the distribution of rent should reflect room sizes. If the big room is 40% bigger, maybe the rent for that room should be higher. But since Y is now in the big room and paying $30 extra, the total rent per person for Y is adjusted, while Z is in a medium room and paying less. X is in a medium room, paying the same as before. If the original rent split was equal, then maybe X is correct that the new arrangement isn't fair because Z is in a smaller room but paying less. But perhaps the deal between Z and Y was a private agreement, and X wasn't part of it. However, roommates might expect that any changes to rent distribution are agreed upon collectively. So Z's decision to have Y pay $30 more without X's consent could be seen as unfair to X, hence X's anger. So the author might be in the wrong for not involving X in the decision and creating an unequal distribution of rent that affects X.\n"
