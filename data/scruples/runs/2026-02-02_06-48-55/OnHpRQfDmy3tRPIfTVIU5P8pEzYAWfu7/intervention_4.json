Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the main question is whether the author did something wrong by charging their roommate $30 a month to give up the bigger room. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, three people moved in together. The apartment has three rooms: two smaller and one bigger. Before moving in, the author and roommates X and Y discussed who would get the big room. Y wanted it but the author also wanted it. They tried to decide fairly by using a random number generator, which the author won. So the author got the big room by chance. \n\nThen, after three days, Y came back asking for the big room, offering to pay $30 extra each month. The author agreed, so Y now has the big room but the author is paying less rent. Now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less, so he's accusing the author of scamming him. \n\nSo the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. Initially, the big room was assigned by a random draw. That seems fair. Then, Y approached the author and offered to pay $30/month for the room. The author accepted this arrangement. There's no mention of X being involved in this agreement. \n\nX's room size is the same as the author's now, but he's upset because he's paying the same as the author was before. The author is now paying $30 less. X feels this is unfair. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the initial assignment was fair. The author then entered a mutual agreement with Y. If the original rent split was based on room size, maybe X wasn't involved in the initial arrangement. But if the rent was split equally, maybe the author is now paying less than their share, which could be unfair to X. \n\nBut the author and Y agreed to an arrangement where Y pays more to get the bigger room. If X wasn't part of that agreement, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the original rent split was supposed to be equal regardless of room size, then the author is profiting at X's expense. \n\nBut the problem is that X wasn't part of the initial decision-making. The author and Y made an agreement. So unless the original agreement with X was that rent would be split equally regardless of room, the author might not be in the wrong. If the rent was split based on room size, then the author's arrangement with Y could be fair. \n\nBut maybe the original rent was split equally, and now the author is paying less. That could be an issue. However, the author is giving up the bigger room for $30, which is a personal arrangement. The question is whether X's room size is the same as the other two. If X was in a smaller room all along and the author is now also in a smaller room, but paying less, maybe that's the problem. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial rent was split based on room size. If the big room was supposed to cost more, then the author getting a discount by Y paying $30 might not affect X. But if the rent was split equally, then the author is now paying less, and X is paying more, which could be unfair. \n\nSo the key here is whether the room assignments and rent splits were agreed upon in a way that includes X. If the author and Y made a separate agreement that affects the overall rent split without X's consent, then maybe the author is in the wrong. But if the initial agreement was that the big room could be auctioned or randomized, and the author and Y made a fair trade, then the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nThe problem is that X wasn't part of the process, so he feels it's unfair. The author might have a point if the arrangement is between Y and the author, but if the overall rent structure was supposed to be equal, then the author's action could be seen as unfair to X. \n\nBut the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering that the author and Y made an agreement without involving X, and X is now paying the same as the author was before, which is less, maybe the author is in the wrong because the arrangement affects the overall fairness of the rent split. However, if the author and Y's agreement doesn't affect the total rent paid by each, maybe it's okay. \n\nWait, if Y is paying the author $30 a month, that's an extra $30 that the author is getting, but the total rent for the apartment is split among three people. So if the author is now paying $30 less, that means either Y is paying the author $30, or the author is not contributing their share. If the total rent is fixed, and the author is paying less, then the other two roommates (X and Y) would have to cover the difference. But the author is getting $30 from Y, so maybe the total rent is still split equally. \n\nFor example, if each was supposed to pay $1000, but the author is paying $970, and Y is paying $1000 plus $30 to the author, then the author is effectively still paying $1000 (since they get $30 from Y). So the total rent remains the same for each person. In that case, X is still paying $1000, and the author is also paying $1000 (after receiving $30 from Y). That would make it fair. \n\nBut if the total rent isn't split equally, and the author is actually paying less, then X is paying more. But the problem is that the author and Y made a private agreement. So if X was okay with the initial arrangement where the big room was assigned by chance, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the room size affects the rent split, and the author is now in a smaller room, maybe their share should be adjusted. But since they got money from Y, it's possible that the rent is still balanced. \n\nSo the key here is whether the author's arrangement with Y affects the rent split in a way that's unfair to X. If the author's payment is compensated by Y, then X isn't directly affected. But if X is now paying the same as before, while the author is effectively paying less, but the author is getting money from Y, it cancels out. \n\nTherefore, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the arrangement between them and Y is private and doesn't affect X's share. However, X might feel it's unfair because he's not part of the agreement. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer could be B (No) because the author entered a fair agreement with Y, and X wasn't part of that. The author isn't scamming X, but rather made a deal with Y that they both agreed to. However, if the original rent structure was supposed to be equal, the author is now paying less, which could be an issue. But since the author is receiving money from Y, it's a balance. \n\nSo the answer is likely B. The author isn't in the wrong.\n"
