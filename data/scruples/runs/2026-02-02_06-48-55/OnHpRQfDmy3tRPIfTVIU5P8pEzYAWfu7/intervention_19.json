Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for scamming their roommate. Let's break down the situation.\n\nSo, three roommates: the author, X, and Y. They moved into an apartment with three bedrooms, one bigger than the others. Before moving in, the author wanted the big room and asked the others. X didn't care, Y wanted it but didn't get it because they didn't have the same income. They rolled a random number generator, and the author got the big room. Then Y came back after three days and wanted to trade, so the author made a deal where Y pays $30 a month to the author to switch rooms.\n\nNow, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less rent. X thinks the author is scamming him by charging Y. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the initial allocation was done with a random method, which seems fair. The author then made a private agreement with Y to switch rooms with compensation. But X wasn't part of that agreement. The problem here is that X wasn't involved in the decision, so he feels left out.\n\nThe key points to consider: Was the agreement between the author and Y valid? Did the author have the right to charge Y without consulting X? If the rent was split equally among all three, then the author taking $30 from Y to compensate for the bigger room might create an imbalance. X is paying the same rent as the author, but the author is effectively getting more money, which X might see as unfair.\n\nHowever, if the original rent division wasn't based on room size, then the author's arrangement with Y could be a way to balance that. But if the total rent is split equally, and Y is paying the author $30, then effectively Y is paying more in total. But from X's perspective, he's not part of that deal and feels it's unfair.\n\nAnother aspect is whether the author had the authority to enter into such an agreement. If the room assignments and any additional payments weren't discussed with X, then X's anger is justified. The author didn't consider X's potential feelings or the group dynamics.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they made a private deal without involving all roommates, leading to an unequal distribution of costs and creating tension. It's possible that the initial rent split didn't account for room sizes, and the author's solution only addressed part of the issue without considering the broader group.\n"
