Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about roommates and the big room.\n\nSo, the setup is that three people moved in together. The apartment has three rooms, with one being 40% bigger. Before moving in, the author (let's call them Person Z) asked X and Y who wanted the big room. X didn't care, Y did. The author also wanted it, so they decided to flip a coin via a random number generator, and Z won. Then a few days later, Y came back asking for the big room, and Z offered to let Y have it if Y pays $30 extra each month. Y agreed. Now X is upset because Z is paying less rent for the same room size.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the fairness of the arrangement. Initially, they used a random generator, which seems fair. Then Y wanted to switch, and Z offered a deal where Y pays $30 more to have the big room. The problem is that X wasn't part of that negotiation. \n\nThe key issue here is whether X had a say in the initial allocation. Since X didn't care about the big room initially, the original decision was between Z and Y. When Y wanted to switch later, Z made a deal with Y, not involving X. But X is now upset because he's paying the same as Z but Z is getting a better deal. However, X had no interest in the big room from the start. \n\nSo, the fairness of the $30 deal between Z and Y is questionable. If all three were splitting the rent equally, and Z is getting a discount for the smaller room, that might be unfair to X. But if the total rent is split equally regardless of room size, then Z's deal with Y could be creating an imbalance. However, if they had a different agreement where the rent is split based on room size, that's different. The problem is that the original agreement wasn't clear on whether rent would be split equally or based on room size.\n\nAlso, when Z made the deal with Y, they didn't include X. If the deal is that Y pays $30 extra to Z, but the overall rent structure isn't adjusted, then X might end up paying more than Z in total. But if the apartment's total rent is fixed and each roommate pays a share, maybe Z is effectively getting a lower share. \n\nSo, from X's perspective, he's paying the same as Z but Z has the bigger room. Then, when Y takes the bigger room and pays more, but Z is still paying less than X. That could be unfair. But if the original agreement was to split rent equally, and the room size was determined by lottery, then perhaps X has no claim. However, when Z and Y negotiated a new arrangement, they didn't involve X, which could be the problem. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if they were splitting rent equally, then Z's deal with Y might be creating an unequal distribution of costs. If Y is paying Z $30 extra, but the total rent is still split three ways, then Z is effectively receiving $30 from Y, which could mean X is subsidizing Z's deal. That's not fair to X. \n\nAlternatively, if the deal was that Y pays Z $30, but the total rent per person remains the same, then perhaps Z is actually paying less of their share. For example, if each was supposed to pay $1000, now Y pays $1030, and Z pays $970? That would create a problem for X, who's still paying $1000. \n\nSo, the main issue is that the initial agreement didn't account for room size in rent splitting. When Z and Y made a private deal, they didn't involve X, leading to an imbalance. Therefore, Z might be in the wrong because they didn't include X in the arrangement, creating an unfair situation where X is effectively paying more relative to Z. \n\nBut if the total rent is split equally, and the room size isn't a factor, then maybe it's acceptable. However, when Y takes the bigger room and pays extra to Z, it's unclear how the overall rent is being adjusted. If the extra $30 is just between Z and Y, but the standard rent is split three ways, then Z is getting a benefit from the deal, which affects X. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's arrangement with Y didn't consider the impact on X, leading to X feeling unfairly treated. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because they didn't involve X in the deal and created an unequal distribution of rent responsibilities.\n"
