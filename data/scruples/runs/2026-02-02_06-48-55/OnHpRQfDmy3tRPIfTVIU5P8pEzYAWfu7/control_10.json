Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for what happened with their roommate. The situation is about room assignments and rent splitting. \n\nFirst, the setup: three people moved into an apartment with three rooms. One room is significantly bigger. Initially, the author and Y wanted the big room. Y didn't want a bidding war because the author has a higher income, so they flipped a coin (using a random.org) and the author won.\n\nThen, after three days, Y changed their mind and offered to pay $30/month for the big room. The author agreed to this deal. Now, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less rent. X thinks the author is scamming him by taking advantage of the rent difference.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the key points.\n\n1. **Initial Agreement**: The big room was decided by a random method because bidding wasn't feasible due to income disparities. The author got the room through random chance. This seems fair, as both parties agreed.\n\n2. **Subsequent Negotiation**: Y approached the author with a trade: pay $30/month to swap the big room. The author agreed. This is a private agreement between two parties. But the issue is that X wasn't part of this negotiation. X is now upset because he feels the rent split isn't fair based on room size.\n\n3. **Roommate Agreement and Fairness**: Typically, roommates agree on how to split rent based on room sizes. If the rent isn't adjusted to account for the bigger room, it's unfair. However, in this case, the author and Y made an agreement where Y gives $30/month to the author. This could be seen as a way to balance the rent. But since the original rent split might not have accounted for room size differences, maybe the author and Y's deal affects X's share indirectly.\n\n4. **X's Perspective**: X is in a smaller room and paying the same as the author. The author is effectively getting a bigger room for less money. X might feel that the author is exploiting the situation by not adjusting the rent split to account for room size. However, the author's agreement with Y might be intended to offset this. But if the total rent isn't adjusted properly among all three, maybe X is paying more than his fair share.\n\n5. **Communication and Consent**: The author didn't consult X when making the deal with Y. Even though it's between two parties, the overall rent structure affects all three. The author might not be in the wrong for making a deal with Y, but they might have failed to communicate with X, leading to X's frustration.\n\n6. **Legality and Common Practice**: In many roommate situations, splitting rent based on room size is common. If the original agreement didn't adjust for room size, and the author and Y's deal is a way to adjust it, but not involving X, that could be problematic. Alternatively, the author might be handling it correctly by compensating for the bigger room through the $30 to Y, which might affect how the total rent is split among all three.\n\nWait, here's a possible misunderstanding. If the total rent is split equally among three, but the author has a bigger room and Y is giving the author $30, that could mean the author is effectively paying less than others. But if the rent was originally split equally, and now the author is getting $30 from Y, that might mean the author's share is reduced by $30, so Y is effectively paying their own share plus an extra $30 to the author. That might not be fair to X, who's still paying the same as before.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author and Y's deal is supposed to adjust the rent so that the total rent each roommate pays reflects the room size. For example, if the big room should cost more, and the author is getting it for free, while Y is paying extra to get it, but the author is getting a discount from Y. But if X isn't part of this, he might feel he's overpaying.\n\nBut the problem is that the author and Y's agreement is between them, but the overall rent structure might not have been adjusted to account for room sizes. If the original rent wasn't split based on room size, and the author's deal with Y is a private arrangement, then X might still be paying more than his fair share.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author might have a point in wanting the bigger room and making a deal with Y. However, not involving X in the decision-making process could be the issue. The author didn't consider that X's room size and rent might need to be adjusted as well. The root problem is that the initial rent split didn't account for room sizes, and the author's private deal with Y may not be sufficient to address that.\n\nIn roommate situations, it's generally important to have an agreement that all parties agree on. Since X wasn't part of the deal, he feels wronged. The author's solution (taking $30 from Y) might not be fair to X, especially if X is in a smaller room and paying the same as the author. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not addressing X's concerns and not ensuring a fair overall rent split among all three parties.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they made a private deal without considering the overall fairness to X and didn't adjust the rent split in a way that includes everyone. The author should have involved X in the discussion about room assignments and rent adjustments to ensure fairness for all.\n"
