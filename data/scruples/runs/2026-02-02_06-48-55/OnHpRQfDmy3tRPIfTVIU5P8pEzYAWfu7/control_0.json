Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they moved in together, and there's a bigger room. Initially, they had a random draw, and the author won the big room. Then the roommate Y wanted it and offered to pay $30 extra a month. The author agreed to switch rooms if Y paid that. Now, roommate X is upset because he's paying the same rent but has a smaller room.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the agreement between the author and Y was fair. When they moved in, the author and Y did a random draw to decide who gets the big room. That seems fair, but then Y wanted to switch. The author agreed to the switch if Y paid $30 more. Since Y had lower income and initially thought it wasn't fair for the author to pay more, maybe the author considered that in the agreement. But when Y agreed to pay the $30, that seems like a mutual agreement between two parties. \n\nHowever, X wasn't part of this agreement. X is now upset because he's not getting the same deal. The problem here is whether the author should have involved X in the discussion. The initial decision to assign rooms via a random draw included both X and Y, but the switch only involved Y. If the original agreement was that the random draw would determine the rooms, then the author might be within their rights to keep the room unless there's a prior agreement about room switches. \n\nBut maybe the author should have considered that X might also want the room or that the rent division is unequal. If all three are splitting rent equally, but the author is effectively getting a discount by staying in a bigger room, then that's unfair to X. However, when the author allowed Y to pay extra to switch, the author is essentially balancing the rent difference. But X isn't part of that agreement. \n\nSo, the key points are: 1) The initial room assignment was fair (random draw). 2) The switch was agreed upon by Y and the author. 3) X wasn't part of that agreement. The issue is that X feels the arrangement is unfair because he's paying the same as the author but has a smaller room. \n\nIf the three of them had agreed on a system where room sizes are considered in rent, then the author's arrangement with Y might be unfair to X. However, if the original agreement was equal rent regardless of room size, then the author and Y's arrangement could be seen as a private agreement that doesn't affect X. But since X wasn't part of that agreement, he might feel left out or that the author is profiting at his expense. \n\nAnother angle: The author allowed Y to switch by taking $30, which might mean the author is effectively getting paid to give up the big room. If the original rent was split equally, then the author is getting more value (bigger room) but paying less rent. By switching, Y pays more to get the bigger room, but X is still paying the same. The author isn't scamming X per se because the agreement was between Y and the author. But maybe the author should have ensured that the rent split is adjusted among all three, not just between Y and themselves. \n\nIn summary, the author might not be in the wrong because the agreement was between two parties, but perhaps the author didn't consider how X would perceive it. However, the core of the problem is that the rent isn't adjusted for room size, which is causing unfairness to X. The author's arrangement with Y might not address X's feelings, but legally or morally, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The answer might be B (No), but there's a nuance here. If the initial agreement was equal rent regardless of room size, then the author isn't wrong. If there was an unspoken agreement about room size affecting rent, then the author might be. But since the author handled it with Y, who was the one wanting the room, it's more likely B.\n"
