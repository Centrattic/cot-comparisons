Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is at fault for \"scamming\" their roommate. The situation involves room assignments and shared rent.\n\nFirst, the setup: three roommates, three bedrooms. One room is 40% bigger. The author, X, and Y are the roommates. Before moving in, Y wanted the big room, the author also wanted it. They decided to flip a coin (using random.org) and the author won. After three days, Y changed their mind and offered to pay $30/month for the big room, which the author accepted. Now, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less rent.\n\nThe key points here are agreements before moving in and fairness. The author and Y had a random draw to decide who gets the big room. Then, when Y wanted to switch, they agreed on a $30/month payment. So, the author is effectively paying more rent by allowing Y to take the big room in exchange for $30.\n\nBut X is upset because he wasn't part of these negotiations. The question is whether the author wronged X by not including him. The original agreement between the author and Y might be valid between them, but if the room sizes affect the total rent split, perhaps there's an issue. However, if the total rent is split equally among all three, and the author is compensating Y via the $30, then the author's room is the same size as X's, but they're paying less. Wait, no: the author gave up the big room to Y for $30, so the author is now in a smaller room. So the author is in a smaller room and receiving $30 from Y to offset that. If the total rent is split three ways, then each pays a third. But if the author is getting $30 from Y, maybe that's to adjust for the room size difference. However, X is in a smaller room and paying the same as the author. So, perhaps X feels it's unfair because he's not getting compensation.\n\nBut the problem is that the original agreement between author and Y might not have considered X's situation. The author didn't consult X when making the deal. However, if the room assignments are up to the individuals, as long as they reach agreements between themselves without affecting others, maybe it's okay. But if the rent is split equally, and the author is getting $30 from Y, then the author's net payment is actually higher than X's. Wait, let me think again. The author agreed to let Y have the big room if Y pays $30 of the author's rent. So if the total rent is, say, $1000 per month, each would normally pay $333.33. But if Y is paying the author $30, then the author's effective payment is $333.33 - $30 = $303.33, while Y pays $333.33 + $30 = $363.33. But Y is in the bigger room. However, X is still paying $333.33 and in a smaller room. So X is paying the same as the author, who is in a smaller room but getting $30. So X might feel it's unfair because he's not getting any compensation for being in a smaller room. But the original arrangement was between the author and Y. If the author had a right to the big room via the random draw, then allowing Y to take it for compensation is their private agreement. However, if the rent splitting is not adjusted proportionally among all roommates, then X might argue it's unfair. The problem is whether the author's arrangement with Y affects X without his consent. If the total rent is split equally, and the author is getting money from Y, that might be seen as the author getting an advantage over X. But if the author is in a smaller room, then maybe the compensation is fair. Alternatively, maybe the author should have adjusted the rent splitting among all three to account for room sizes. But the author didn't do that; instead, they made a side agreement with Y. So perhaps the author is at fault for not addressing room size differences equitably with all roommates. X's argument is that the author is paying less rent for a smaller room, which is unfair to X. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering X's situation and for creating an unequal financial arrangement without collective agreement. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
