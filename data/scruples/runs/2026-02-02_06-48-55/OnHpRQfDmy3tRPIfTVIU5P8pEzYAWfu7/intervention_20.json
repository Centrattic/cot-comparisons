Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is about the big room and the rent distribution.\n\nFirst, when they moved in, the author and Y decided to flip a coin to get the big room, and the author won. Then Y asked for the room again after three days, and the author agreed to give it up if Y paid $30 extra each month. Now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less rent. \n\nI need to consider a few things. First, was the initial agreement fair? The author and Y used a random method, which seems fair. Then, when Y wanted the room, they negotiated a deal where Y pays more rent. The author is now paying less than X and Y because of that deal. \n\nBut X wasn't part of that negotiation. The problem is whether the author should have included X in the discussion. If all three roommates agreed on the rent split initially, maybe the author changed it without consulting X. That could be an issue. If the rent was split equally before, and now the author is getting a discount, X feels cheated because he's paying the same but in a smaller room. \n\nBut the author might argue that the $30 is a private agreement between them and Y. However, in a shared apartment, the total rent is probably split among all roommates. If the author is saving $30 a month, that means Y is effectively paying more to take over the bigger room. But if the total rent is fixed, maybe the author isn't getting a discount but Y is paying the author? Wait, the situation says the author is paying $30 less. So maybe the total rent is divided among three, and the author's portion is reduced by $30, with Y covering that by paying $30 more. But that would mean the total rent is split as author: (original amount - $30), Y: (original + $30), and X: same as before. \n\nBut if X wasn't part of this arrangement, he might feel like he's paying an unfair share. The problem is that the author and Y made a private deal without involving X. Even if the initial process was fair, changing the rent terms without consulting all roommates could be a problem. Roommate agreements usually require all parties to agree on the setup. So if the author is taking money from Y to take the room, and that affects X's share, then X has a valid point. The author might be creating an unfair split without X's consent. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't include X in the agreement, leading to an unequal distribution of rent that X didn't agree to.\n"
