Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault for scamming their roommate. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, they moved in with two others. The apartment had three rooms, one bigger than the others. Before moving in, the author and their roommates (X and Y) discussed who gets the big room. Y wanted it, and the author also wanted it. They considered randomizing it or letting the highest bidder take it. Y argued against the highest bidder because of income differences, so they randomized it, and the author won.\n\nThen, after three days, Y wanted the room because of their bed and offered to pay $30 extra to the author each month so the author would give up the room. The author agreed, so Y took the room and pays the author $30 a month. Now, X is upset because he's paying the same rent as the author but the author is getting an extra $30. He's calling the author an asshole for scamming him.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's consider the key points. When the room was assigned, X was part of the initial discussion but didn't express interest in the big room. The author and Y resolved the conflict between themselves, and X didn't object until later. The agreement between the author and Y was mutual and voluntary; Y agreed to pay $30 to the author. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the original rent split might not have accounted for the different room sizes. If the author was paying the same as X but got the bigger room initially, maybe that was unfair. However, after the swap, Y is paying extra to the author, which could balance things out. But X is now upset because he's not part of this agreement and feels he's paying more indirectly. \n\nBut did the author have the right to negotiate with Y? Since X didn't want the big room initially, the author and Y handling the arrangement might be acceptable. However, if the total rent is split equally among all three, then the author receiving $30 from Y could mean the author is effectively paying less. But if the rent is divided equally, then X's complaint is about the unequal distribution of costs. \n\nHowever, the author didn't take money from X; the transaction is between Y and the author. If the original agreement for the room was fair (through random.org), then the author's decision to sell the room to Y for $30 isn't inherently wrong, as long as it's mutual. But if the total rent isn't adjusted accordingly, maybe the arrangement isn't fair. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the author should have gotten X's consent before making the deal with Y. If all three roommates agreed initially on the rotation, but the author made a separate deal with Y without involving X, that could be problematic. However, since X didn't want the big room at first, maybe it's their own fault for not expressing interest. \n\nIn roommate situations, it's important that all parties agree on room assignments and rent splits. If the original rent split didn't account for room sizes, that's a problem. The author's solution might be a way to adjust for that. However, if the author is getting $30 from Y, and the total rent is split equally, then the author's share is effectively reduced, which could be seen as unfair to X. \n\nBut the author isn't taking money from X; the $30 is from Y. The issue is that the author is benefiting from the room swap, which X didn't agree to. If the total rent is the same, but the author is getting paid by Y, then the author is in a better position than X. However, if the original agreement was that whoever had the bigger room would pay a bit more, but that wasn't the case, then Y is compensating the author privately. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because the agreement was mutual between two roommates, and X didn't express interest in the big room. However, if the overall rent split isn't adjusted to account for room sizes, the arrangement could be seen as unfair. But since the author isn't directly taking money from X, it's more of a lateral agreement. The answer likely depends on whether the initial rent agreement was equal for all rooms or not. If the rent was equal regardless of room size, then the author's arrangement with Y might be a fair way to balance things. However, if the rent was supposed to be equal because rooms were to be assigned fairly, then maybe the author is taking advantage. But given the details, the author acted within their right to make a deal with Y, so the answer is B.\n"
