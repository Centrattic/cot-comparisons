Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about roommates and assigning the bigger room. The apartment has three bedrooms, with one being 40% larger. The author, X, and Y moved in together. Initially, they had to decide who gets the bigger room. Y wanted it, the author did too, and after a discussion, they decided to flip a coin or use a random generator. The author won, so they got the big room.\n\nThen, a few days later, Y changed their mind and wanted the big room. The author agreed to let Y have it if they paid $30 extra each month. Now, X is upset because he feels the author is getting a discount by not paying that $30, while X is paying the original amount. X is mad and says the author is scamming them.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The initial allocation was done fairly through a random draw. Both Y and the author wanted the room, and they agreed to the random method. The author won and took the room. Then, when Y wanted to switch, the author offered a price for the room. Y agreed, so they made a deal. \n\nNow, X is upset because he wasn't part of the negotiation. But X didn't express any interest in the bigger room initially. The problem is that X is comparing his own situation to the author's. Since the author is now getting $30 less, X feels it's unfair. However, X never wanted the bigger room. The author and Y made a mutual agreement without X's input because X didn't have a claim to the room.\n\nIs there a problem here? If all three roommates had agreed on the initial terms, maybe, but the setup was that two people wanted the room. The author and Y resolved their conflict through a random method, and later a monetary exchange. X's grievance is that he's paying more, but he didn't want the big room. The fairness of the arrangement depends on whether the initial agreement was done properly. If all three were part of the original rent split and room assignments, then maybe the deal between Y and the author changed the financial arrangement without X's consent. But if the rent per person was always split three ways, and now the author is getting $30 less from Y, that might affect X's share. Wait, the total rent is split among three, so if Y is paying $30 extra to the author, does that mean the total rent remains the same? Or is the author getting $30 on top? That's a bit unclear. If the author is getting $30 from Y, then the total rent paid by Y to the landlord is more, but the author is keeping the extra. If the original agreement was that each pays a third of the total rent, then Y paying more to the author would be a private arrangement, but that could create an imbalance. X might feel that the total rent should be split equally, and now the author is making extra money, which isn't part of the original agreement. So the author is in the wrong if they didn't involve X in the financial arrangement. Alternatively, if the author and Y handled it between themselves without changing the total rent each person pays to the landlord, then maybe it's okay. But the scenario is a bit ambiguous. However, since X is upset about paying the same rent while the author pays less, that suggests that the author is receiving an unequal share. If the author and Y made a side deal that affects the overall rent distribution, then the author is in the wrong. Otherwise, if the total rent remains the same and the author is just getting an extra $30 from Y, then maybe not. The key point is whether the original agreement allowed for such a side deal. If all roommates agreed to the random selection and the subsequent deal only between Y and the author was made without considering X's input, then X's grievance is valid. The author might have acted in their own interest but didn't consider the fairness to X. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't include X in the decision-making, leading to an unequal financial burden. However, if the deal between Y and the author was a private agreement and the total rent each person paid to the landlord remained the same, then perhaps not. The scenario doesn't clarify if the total rent is split three ways or if the author is receiving the $30 as a personal gain. Assuming that the author is keeping the $30, which affects the overall rent distribution, then the author is in the wrong. So I think the answer is A.\n"
