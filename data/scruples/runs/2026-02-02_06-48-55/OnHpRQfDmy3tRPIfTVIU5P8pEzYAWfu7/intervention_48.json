Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves roommates and the allocation of a bigger room. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author, X, and Y moved into an apartment with three bedrooms. The big room is 40% bigger than the other two. Initially, the author wanted the big room and proposed a random draw or a bid based on paying extra rent. Y wanted the room but argued against a bid because of income inequality. So they used a random generator, and the author won. Then, after a few days, Y asked for the room again, offering to pay $30 extra. The author agreed to let Y have the room if Y paid $30/month to the author. Now, X is upset because the author is getting $30 less in rent compared to X.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement and the subsequent change. The initial allocation was decided by chance, which seemed fair. However, when Y later asked for the room and they made a private agreement, the author didn't involve X. X feels left out and that the author is profiting unfairly. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, when they first allocated the room via random.org, X didn't object. The problem arises when Y wanted to switch. The author and Y made a deal without consulting X. Since all three roommates are sharing the rent, changing who pays how much should involve all parties. The author's solution was to have Y pay $30 to the author, which effectively means the author is getting a discount, and X ends up paying more. But since the total rent is fixed, if the author is receiving money from Y, that might not be part of the main rent split. However, the way the author framed it is that Y is paying the author directly, which might not have been discussed with the entire group. \n\nX's argument is that it's unfair because he's paying the same as the author but the author is getting $30 less. But actually, the total rent paid by all three should be the same. If Y is paying $30 to the author, then the total rent paid by the three would be the same (assuming they split equally otherwise). Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. If the rent is split equally among three, each pays a third. But if Y gives $30 to the author, the author is effectively paying $30 less than Y. So the total amount paid by the author and Y would be the same as if they split equally. Wait, maybe not. Let's say the total rent is, for example, $1500. Each pays $500. If Y gives $30 to the author, then the author is paying $470, Y is paying $530. So the author is getting $30 less. X is paying $500. So from X's perspective, he's paying more than the author. But the problem is that the author and Y made this arrangement without X's knowledge or agreement. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not including X in the agreement. The original agreement was between the author and Y. However, since all three roommates share the space and the rent is likely split equally, any side deal between two of them could affect the third. Therefore, the author should have discussed the arrangement with X to ensure everyone's comfort. Even if the deal is between the author and Y, the perceived unfairness in rent splitting might be a result of not communicating with X. \n\nIn roommate situations, transparency is key. The author and Y's deal could be seen as a private arrangement, but since it affects the rent dynamics, X might feel it's unfair. The author might be in the wrong for not involving X in the decision-making process, especially since the room allocation affects the overall living arrangement and financial contributions. \n\nHowever, another angle is that the room size doesn't directly affect the rent split unless they have an agreement that room size affects rent. If they split rent equally regardless of room size, then the author's deal with Y is a separate matter. But X might argue that the larger room's value is not accounted for in the rent split, so the author is benefiting from a better room without paying more. But in this case, the author gave up the room to Y for a payment, so maybe that balances it. Still, the main issue is that the author didn't involve X in the discussion, leading to X's upset. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be at fault for not including X in the agreement. Even if the deal between author and Y is fair, the lack of transparency and communication with X could be the problem. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
