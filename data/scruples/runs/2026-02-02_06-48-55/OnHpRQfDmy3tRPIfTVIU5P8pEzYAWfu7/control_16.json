Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. The situation is about roommates splitting an apartment with different-sized rooms. The user, the third roommate, initially won the biggest room via a random draw. Then another roommate, Y, wanted it and offered to pay an extra $30/month rent. Now, X is upset because the author is paying less rent for the same-sized room.\n\nFirst, I need to check the initial agreement. When moving in, X didn't care which room they got, but Y wanted the bigger one. They decided to randomize it, and the author won. Then Y came back after three days, wanted the room, and the author agreed that Y could take it if they paid $30 extra each month. So the author is getting $30 less rent, but Y is in the bigger room.\n\nNow, X is angry because he's in a smaller room and paying more. The key here is whether the original agreement was fair. If the rent was split equally at the start, maybe the author's adjustment to charge Y more is seen as unfair. But if the author adjusted their own rent to account for the bigger room, that's normal. However, in this case, the author is getting $30 less, which might mean that the total rent is being split unevenly now, which could be the issue.\n\nWait, the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author and Y made a mutual agreement where Y pays $30 more to get the bigger room. If the total rent is split such that the author is paying less because they're in the bigger room, that's standard. But if the author is taking $30 from Y and keeping it as their own, that's different. If the author is supposed to split the rent equally and instead kept the extra $30 for themselves, that's problematic. However, if the author's rent is adjusted so that Y pays more overall (so the author's share is less), that's fair.\n\nBut maybe the problem is that X wasn't involved in the agreement. If the original arrangement was that everyone pays equal rent regardless of room size, and the author changed it without consulting X, then X is upset. However, the author and Y made a private agreement. If the author is allowed to adjust their rent based on room size, then it's okay. But if the initial agreement was equal split, then any deviation could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: when the author and Y agreed that Y would pay $30 more for the bigger room, was that money going to the author or to the landlord? If it's going to the author, then that's essentially a side agreement. However, if the rent is set by the landlord and the author is just adjusting their own share of the total rent, that's different. If the total rent is fixed, and the author is taking less so Y pays more, then it's a fair arrangement. But if the author is keeping the $30 as personal gain, that's not right.\n\nBut the user's description says \"you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" So if the author was going to move out of the big room, they would get $30/month from Y. So the author is getting $30/month to give up the big room. But the author already had the big room via the initial random draw. So by accepting $30 to move out, maybe the author is effectively transferring the right to the big room for compensation. However, if the author isn't supposed to get any extra money and instead the rent should be adjusted so that Y pays more for the bigger room, then the author is taking advantage by keeping the $30 instead of splitting it or using it to adjust the rent.\n\nAlternatively, if the total rent isn't adjusted, and the author is just pocketing the $30, that's not fair to X. But if the author is adjusting their own rent so that Y pays more, then it's okay. The problem is the lack of clarity in the agreement. The author and Y made a deal without X's consent, which could be seen as unfair since X is paying more now. The original agreement was a random draw, but after that, changing it requires all parties' agreement. If X wasn't part of the agreement, then he might feel it's unfair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not involving X in the rent adjustment, leading to unequal payments without consensus.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they altered the arrangement without consulting all roommates, leading to unequal rent distribution, which X is now upset about. The author should have discussed the rent adjustment with X to ensure fair splitting based on room sizes.\n"
