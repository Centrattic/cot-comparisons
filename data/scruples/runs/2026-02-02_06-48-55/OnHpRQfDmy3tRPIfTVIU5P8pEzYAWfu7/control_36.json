Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nSo, three roommates: the author, X, and Y. They moved into an apartment with three rooms, one bigger than the others. Initially, the author and Y both wanted the big room. They decided to flip a coin or something similar (using random.org), and the author won. Then, after three days, Y changed his mind and wanted the room, so they agreed that Y would pay $30 extra each month to the author to swap. Now, X is upset because he's paying the same rent as Y but the author is getting $30 less. He's claiming the author is scamming him.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about fairness and agreements. When they moved in, they decided who got the big room via a random draw, which seems fair. Then, Y wanted to trade, so they made an agreement where Y pays extra. But X wasn't part of that negotiation. \n\nWait, the original setup was three people. The author and Y wanted the big room, X didn't care. So X didn't have a problem with the initial allocation. But when Y asked to swap, the author agreed to a monetary exchange. Now X is upset because he's paying more rent than the author. But actually, if the total rent is split equally among three, and the author is getting $30 from Y, that might mean the author is effectively paying less. But X is paying the same as Y, but Y is giving $30 to the author, so maybe the author's net is lower. \n\nBut is that fair? The author and Y made a private agreement. The problem is whether other roommates should be involved. If the rent is split equally, but one roommate is paying extra to another, that creates an imbalance. Maybe X feels that the original agreement didn't account for this. \n\nIn roommate agreements, usually, all parties should agree on any side deals that affect the overall split. If the author and Y made a deal without consulting X, that could be the issue. Even if the author isn't directly taking money from X, the indirect effect is that X is paying more relative to the author. The problem might be that the author didn't involve X in the negotiations, leading to an unequal distribution from X's perspective. \n\nBut in terms of legality or ethical standards, unless there was a prior agreement that all roommates must agree on room assignments or financial arrangements, the author and Y could have made their own deal. However, the fact that X is now upset suggests that maybe the author should have considered X's perspective. The author's rent is effectively lower because of the $30, which might be unfair if the total shared rent isn't adjusted accordingly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the $30 is just a transfer between Y and the author, not affecting the total rent paid to the landlord. So if the rent is split equally among all three, and Y is paying the author $30, then Y's total is higher than the author's. But X is paying the same as Y, so X is paying more than the author. That's the crux of X's complaint. \n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault for allowing this arrangement without X's input. If the original agreement was that the big room was assigned fairly, and then a private deal was made, maybe it's not the author's fault. But if the arrangement creates an imbalance in the shared living situation, perhaps the author should have discussed it with X. \n\nI think the key point is whether the author's deal with Y affects X's living conditions or financial responsibility. Since X's rent isn't changing and he's in a smaller room, maybe X is upset because he feels he's paying more for a smaller room. The author's agreement with Y could be seen as creating an unfair advantage for the author. \n\nBut in many roommate situations, people do make private arrangements. However, if the overall rent is split equally, and one person is getting a larger room while others aren't, but also not paying more, that might be considered unfair. The author's arrangement might be a way to balance the value of the rooms. \n\nWait, the initial assignment was random, so everyone had a fair chance. Then, after that, Y wanted to trade and paid for the room. That seems fair between the two. However, X's issue is that he's in a smaller room and paying the same rent as Y, who is in a bigger room. The author is in the big room but paying less because Y is giving him $30. So from X's perspective, the author is getting a better deal. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't at fault because the initial agreement was fair, and the subsequent trade was between Y and the author. However, if the total amount the author pays is less than X and Y, that creates an imbalance. The problem is whether the author should have considered X's perspective when making the deal with Y. \n\nIn conclusion, the author made a deal with Y without involving X, leading to an imbalance in the shared rent. Even if the deal is fair between the author and Y, the overall arrangement affects X. Therefore, the author is at fault for not involving X in the negotiations and creating an unfair situation for him.\n"
