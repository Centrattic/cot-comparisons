Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by charging a roommate an extra $30 per month for the bigger room. \n\nFirst, the setup: Three people moved into an apartment. The rooms differ in size. The bigger room was assigned via a random draw, which the author won. Then, after three days, the roommate Y wanted the room and offered to pay $30 a month for it. The author agreed, leading to a situation where X is upset because he's paying the same as Y but the author is getting a discount.\n\nHmm. The initial assignment was random, which seems fair. But when Y wanted to switch, the author made a deal. But X wasn't part of that negotiation. Now X feels he's being treated unfairly. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are fairness in roommate arrangements. Typically, when roommates split rent, if there's a discrepancy in room sizes, it's common to adjust the rent accordingly. But in this case, the author set up a private agreement with Y, which left X paying the same. X might feel that the author is exploiting the situation by getting a lower rent without him being involved.\n\nBut wait, the original agreement was random. Then, when Y wanted to switch, the author allowed it for $30. Maybe X wasn't part of the initial random draw, but the author made a deal without consulting him. That could be where the issue lies. Roommate agreements usually require all parties to agree on the terms. If the author adjusted the rent between Y and himself without X's consent, that might be unfair because X's share isn't adjusted. \n\nAlso, the initial random draw was between Y and the author. X wasn't part of that. But when the author and Y made the payment deal, they didn't involve X. So X might feel that the arrangement is affecting him since his rent is the same, but the author is effectively paying less. \n\nAnother angle: if the total rent is split equally, then the author's room is worth more. If the author is getting a discount, that's essentially taking advantage of Y's need. However, if the total rent is split equally, maybe all roommates should contribute equally, regardless of room size. So, the author's decision to take money from Y to switch rooms might not be fair to X, who is still paying the same rate for a smaller room.\n\nBut the author didn't charge X any extra; instead, Y is paying the author. So, in effect, the total rent paid by Y is higher than X's. But the total rent for the apartment is fixed, right? So if Y is paying the author $30 more, that would mean the author is effectively getting a discount from the overall rent. However, if the apartment's total rent is equally divided among all three, then Y's extra $30 is going to the author, not the apartment's landlord. That could be problematic because the actual rent paid to the landlord is the same, but the author is receiving money from Y, which might not be accounted for in the original agreement.\n\nWait, but the original problem didn't specify whether the total rent is split equally. If the total rent is split equally, then each roommate pays a third. The author is in the bigger room, but if Y pays the author $30, that's a private agreement. So in terms of the apartment's total rent, the author is still paying their third, and Y is paying their third plus $30 to the author. However, X is paying the same as everyone else. But that could make X feel like the author is getting an unfair advantage because they're effectively paying less total rent than X.\n\nSo, the problem is that the author and Y made a side deal without involving X. If the original agreement was that the rent would be split equally regardless of room size, then the author's arrangement with Y is violating that. However, if the original agreement allowed for roommates to negotiate among themselves, then maybe it's okay. But since X wasn't part of the initial room assignment and now feels left out, the author's action might be seen as unfair.\n\nAnother thought: when the author and Y made the deal, they could have proposed a new arrangement where everyone's rent is adjusted based on room size. For example, the author could have asked for a lower share, and Y pays more, while X's share remains the same or is adjusted. But since they only adjusted between themselves, X is left out, leading to his frustration.\n\nIn roommate situations, fairness is key. If one person is in a bigger room, it's customary to pay more. However, in this case, Y is paying the author instead of the landlord. That might not be the right approach because the actual rent paid to the apartment should reflect the room's value. Instead, the author is getting money from Y, which isn't part of the official rent. This could lead to disputes because it's not transparent and affects X.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they made an agreement with Y that didn't include X, leading to an unequal distribution of rent from X's perspective. The proper way would have been to involve all parties in the agreement to adjust the rent fairly based on room size and contributions among roommates.\n"
