Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about roommates splitting rent and room assignments.\n\nFirst, there are three people: the author, X, and Y. The apartment has three rooms, one bigger than the others. Before moving in, the author and Y wanted the big room. Y didn't want to bid because of income differences, so they randomized it, and the author won. Then, after three days, Y wanted the room and offered to pay $30 extra each month for the author to switch. The author agreed, so now Y has the big room and pays an extra $30. Now X is upset because he's in the smaller room and the author is paying less. X claims the author is scamming him.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about fairness. When they moved in, there were three people. The author and Y decided to randomize the big room between themselves, but X was also a roommate. Maybe X didn't get a say in the initial allocation? Then when the author and Y made the deal later, X wasn't part of that agreement. So X feels like he's paying more because the author is getting a better room for less rent, which isn't fair to X.\n\nThe author argues that they gave up the big room for $30, but the problem is that X wasn't part of that deal. If all three roommates didn't agree on the terms, then maybe the author shouldn't have made a private arrangement that affects X's share of the rent. Because typically, when roommates split rent, they should agree on the distribution of rooms and any additional payments. If the author and Y made a separate agreement without X's knowledge or consent, that could be unfair to X. \n\nAlso, the initial randomization was between the author and Y, but X was also a roommate. Maybe the process should have included all three to decide. If the author didn't consider X's input from the start, that's a problem. Now that X is paying the same as Y but the author is getting a discount, X feels it's unfair. The author's solution only addressed Y's problem but left X out, leading to resentment.\n\nSo, in terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't involve X in the initial room assignment and then made a private deal that affects X's financial burden without his agreement. The fairness of the arrangement depends on whether all roommates agreed to the terms. If the author and Y went behind X's back, then the author is at fault. Therefore, the answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
