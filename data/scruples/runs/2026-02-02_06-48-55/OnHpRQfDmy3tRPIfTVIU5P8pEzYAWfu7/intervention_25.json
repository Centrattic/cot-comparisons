Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this roommate situation. So, the setup is three roommates splitting an apartment with three rooms. The big room is 40% bigger, and there was a dispute over who gets it. The author, along with roommates X and Y, decided to use a random generator to determine who gets the big room, and the author won. Then Y asked to switch, and the author agreed to let Y have it if Y pays $30 extra each month. Now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author did something wrong. The key points here are the initial agreement, the fairness of the method used to assign the rooms, and whether the subsequent deal between the author and Y affected X. \n\nInitially, the room was assigned randomly, which is a fair method. So the author had the right to the big room at that point. Then Y wanted it more and offered to pay extra. The author agreed to the $30 deal. The problem is X is upset because he wasn't part of the negotiation and now feels the rent is unequal. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author should have involved X in the decision, even though the deal was between the author and Y. Rent splitting can be tricky. If all roommates are part of the lease, then any changes to the rent distribution should ideally be approved by all. However, if the room assignments are based on room sizes, then it's common to adjust the rent accordingly. But in this case, the lease might not have accounted for different room sizes. \n\nIf the lease requires equal rent, then the author and Y's agreement could be seen as violating the lease terms. But if the lease allows for unequal rent based on room size, then the $30 extra from Y might be acceptable. However, X's claim is that the author is paying less, which affects X's rent if the total is split. Wait, actually, if the total rent is fixed, and Y is paying $30 more to the author, that might not affect X's share unless the author is effectively receiving $30 less from the total. Wait, maybe the total rent is split three ways. If Y is paying an extra $30 to the author, maybe the author is keeping that $30 as a personal gain, which makes X pay the same as before, but the author is getting more. That would be unfair because X is not getting any extra for his smaller room. \n\nAlternatively, if the deal is that Y is paying $30 to the author to cover the difference in room size, but the lease requires equal rent, then the author is effectively profiting from the room size difference, which could be seen as unfair. But if the lease allows variable rent, then it's okay. The problem here is not clear if the lease allows for different rent per room. \n\nAlso, the fact that X was not involved in the deal. Even if the author and Y made a private agreement, if the total rent is split equally, then the author's taking $30 from Y would mean that the author is receiving more than their share, which could be seen as exploiting the situation. Because if the total rent is $X per month, each roommate is supposed to pay $X/3. If Y pays the author $30, the author is effectively getting $X/3 + $30, while X and Y pay $X/3 each. That's not fair because the author is profiting from the room size without adjusting the rent accordingly for X. \n\nSo the author might be in the wrong because the deal with Y created an unequal distribution of financial responsibility without consulting all roommates. The author should have either adjusted the rent so all roommates paid according to the room size, which would mean X might also have to pay more if he wanted a bigger room, but since he didn't, he's in a smaller room. But by letting Y pay the author $30, the author is essentially keeping that extra money, which is not part of the original agreement with X and Y. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because the deal with Y affects the financial arrangement with X without X's consent. The right approach would have been to involve all roommates in the decision on how to split the rent based on room sizes, rather than a private agreement between two roommates.\n"
