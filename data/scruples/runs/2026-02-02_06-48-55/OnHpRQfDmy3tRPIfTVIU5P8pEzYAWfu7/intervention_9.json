Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that three people moved into an apartment with three rooms. Two smaller and one bigger. The author wanted the big room and ended up winning a lottery (random.org) to get it. Then, after a few days, roommate Y asked if he could switch, and the author agreed if Y paid $30 more each month. Now, roommate X is upset because he's paying more even though he has the same-sized room.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the initial agreement. The author and Y decided to use a random selection to determine who gets the big room. The author won and took it. Then Y came back and wanted to switch, so the author made a deal where Y could take the big room if he paid $30 extra. So, Y pays more to get the bigger room, and the author gets that extra money.\n\nNow, X is upset because he's not involved in this deal. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for making this deal without involving X. \n\nHmm. When they initially decided who gets the big room, they used a random method. The author won, so they had the right to the big room. Then, when Y wanted to switch, the author had the right to negotiate terms for giving up that room. The problem is that X didn't agree to this deal, so he feels it's unfair that he's paying less but with a smaller room.\n\nBut wait, the original agreement was between the author and Y. The author had the right to the big room, and Y wanted to trade. The author could choose to sell that right for $30. Since X wasn't part of the initial negotiation, maybe he didn't have a say. However, X might argue that the total rent should be split equally, but since one person is paying more for a bigger room, that's affecting the others' payments.\n\nWait, the total rent is split three ways, but Y is paying $30 more to the author. Does that mean Y is actually paying $30 more on top of their original share? If the total rent is the same, but Y is giving $30 to the author, then the author is effectively receiving $30 from Y. That would mean the author is making extra money, while X is still paying the same. So from X's perspective, he's paying the same as Y but getting a smaller room, and the author is profit-sharing with Y.\n\nBut was there an initial agreement about splitting the rent equally? If the total rent is divided equally, but Y is paying extra to the author, that's a side agreement. The problem is that the author is getting money from Y, which affects X's perception of fairness.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that the room sizes are different, and it's reasonable to charge more for the bigger room. But if they didn't agree on a system for that beforehand, it could be seen as unfair to the other roommate who wasn't involved in the negotiation.\n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because the initial agreement between the author and Y didn't consider X's perspective. Since X wasn't part of the arrangement, he feels shortchanged. The author should have discussed the room allocation and any financial agreements with all roommates, not just the two involved.\n\nAlternatively, if the total rent is split equally, and the author is just receiving $30 from Y, then technically, the author isn't reducing their own rent but is getting extra money. That might be seen as unfair to X. But if the author and Y agreed that Y would pay more for the bigger room, even if X isn't part of that, but the overall rent is split equally, then the author is getting an advantage.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because the arrangement wasn't made transparently with all roommates. Even though it was between the author and Y, the effect on X is that he's paying the same but getting a smaller room, which he feels is unfair. The author should have considered discussing this with X to ensure fairness for everyone, not just the two involved.\n"
