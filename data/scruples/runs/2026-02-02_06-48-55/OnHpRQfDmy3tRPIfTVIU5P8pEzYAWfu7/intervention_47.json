Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault. \n\nFirst, the setup: Three roommates in an apartment with three bedrooms, one bigger. Initially, before moving in, there's a discussion about who gets the big room. The author wanted it, and Y also wanted it. They considered random selection or a bidding process. Y objected to the bidding because of income disparity, so they used a random.org roll, and the author won.\n\nThen, three days later, Y changed his mind, saying he needed the big room and offered to pay $30 more per month to the author. The author agreed, so Y moved into the big room, and the author gets $30 less rent. Now, roommate X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less rent. X claims the author is scamming him by keeping the deal with Y without considering him.\n\nThe key points here are the initial agreement and the subsequent change. The author and Y resolved the initial conflict fairly through random selection. When Y wanted to switch, they made a private agreement. The problem arises because X feels left out and believes the arrangement is unfair.\n\nBut wait, did X have a say in the initial process? The original decision to use random.org involved all parties? Or just the author and Y? The scenario says before moving in, the author asked roommates X and Y. So maybe X was part of the initial discussion. If the author and Y made a deal without consulting X, that could be the issue. However, the original allocation (via random.org) was between Y and the author, and X didn't care. Then, when Y wants to switch, the author and Y made a private arrangement. If the total rent is split equally among the three, then the author getting $30 less would mean that X is effectively paying more, which he finds unfair.\n\nSo the core issue is whether the author should have involved X in the deal. If the room change affects how the rent is split among all three, then making a private agreement without consulting X could be seen as unfair. The initial random selection was between two people, but the financial arrangement after the switch impacts all three. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering X's perspective and for not adjusting the rent distribution in a way that's fair to everyone.\n\nBut another angle: The author and Y made a deal where Y pays $30 to the author. If the total rent is fixed, then the author is reducing their portion by $30, meaning the other two have to cover that. However, if the deal was that Y pays the author $30, and the landlord still charges the same total rent, the author is effectively getting $30 from Y, which is extra. That's where the scamming accusation comes from. It's not clear if the total rent is split equally or if the deal is a private arrangement.\n\nIf the deal is between Y and the author, and the landlord is not involved, then the author is getting an extra $30 from Y, which might not be fair to X. But if the total rent is split equally, and the author is just transferring $30 to Y, then it's a different scenario. However, the way it's written, the author says \"you can have the room instead of me. That's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" So the author is accepting $30/month from Y to move out, which would mean the author is getting $30 from Y, effectively reducing their own rent. If the total rent is split equally among three, then each pays 1/3. But if the author is taking $30 from Y, that could mean the author's personal rent is lower by $30, which is unfair to X.\n\nTherefore, the author's action of taking $30 from Y to move out might be seen as exploiting their position, as it creates an imbalance in the rent distribution among the roommates. Since X was part of the initial agreement (the random.org roll), he might feel that the subsequent arrangement should have included him. The author didn't consult X when making the deal, leading to X's resentment.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because the financial arrangement with Y affects all roommates, and the author didn't address X's potential concerns. The deal between Y and the author created an unfair distribution of rent costs without X's consent.\n"
