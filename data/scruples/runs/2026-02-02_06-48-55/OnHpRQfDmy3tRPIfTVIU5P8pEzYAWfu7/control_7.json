Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about roommates splitting an apartment with different sized rooms. The person in question got the bigger room through a random draw, but then someone else wanted it and they made a deal where the other person pays extra to switch.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The original agreement: three roommates, three rooms. The big room was up for grabs between two people. The first roommate (Y) wanted it, but didn't want to pay more because they have a lower income. So they used a random.org to decide, and the author won. Then after a few days, Y changed their mind and wanted the big room. The author agreed that Y could take it if they paid $30 extra per month. So now Y has the big room and pays more, while X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is effectively paying less.\n\nNow, X is mad because he thinks the author is scamming him by getting a better deal. The author didn't even ask X about this arrangement, just did a deal with Y. The question is whether that's fair or not.\n\nI think the main issue here is about fairness in room assignments and rent distribution. When roommates split the rent equally, it's assumed that the space is equally shared, but in reality, bigger rooms are worth more. So maybe the author is right in compensating through the deal with Y, but only if the overall rent is split appropriately. However, the problem here is that X is paying the same as Y, but Y is effectively paying less because they're taking over the big room with a $30 discount for the author. Wait, no, actually, the author is paying $30 less because Y is paying an extra $30? Wait, the author said, \"you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" So the author would get $30 from Y each month. So the author's rent is reduced by $30, while Y's rent increases by $30. But the total rent for the apartment remains the same. So if the original rent was split equally among three people, moving to a new arrangement where Y pays more and the author pays less might make X feel like he's paying more relative to others.\n\nBut the key is whether all roommates agreed to the new arrangement. The author only made the deal with Y, not with X. So X might feel that his agreement is not respected. If the original rent was divided equally, then the author taking $30 from Y would mean Y is effectively paying more than X and the author. But if the total rent is the same, maybe X is in the same position as before, just the author is getting a lower share because they switched rooms. However, X is in a smaller room, so maybe he should be compensated in some way? Or maybe not, since the initial room assignments were determined by a random draw. \n\nThe problem is whether the author should have included X in the decision. Since the initial allocation was between two people (the author and Y) for the big room, X didn't have a say. But when Y wanted to switch, the author made a deal with Y without consulting X. X might feel that the author is getting an unfair advantage. Also, if the total rent is split equally, but one person is effectively paying an extra $30, then the other two are paying less. However, the $30 is between the author and Y, so maybe X's share is not directly affected unless the total rent is divided differently. Wait, maybe the total rent is split three ways. Let's say the total rent is $R. Each pays $R/3. After the deal, Y pays $R/3 + $30, the author pays $R/3 - $30, and X pays $R/3. But that would mean Y is paying more than others, which isn't fair because the big room is worth more. So perhaps the right way is to adjust the rent based on room size. If the big room is 40% bigger, maybe the big room rent should be higher. But in this case, the author and Y made a side agreement where the author gets a discount for giving up the big room. However, X is not part of this agreement and feels he's being treated unfairly.\n\nAnother angle: when they moved in, the big room was assigned via random.org between the author and Y. X didn't participate in that. Now, when Y wants to switch, the author allows it with a payment. But X is upset because he's not part of the deal. The author might argue that the arrangement is between him and Y, but X is another roommate, and the rent structure affects all of them. If they are all paying the same total rent, but the author is getting a discount because of the room switch, then X is effectively subsidizing the author's lower rent. That might be unfair to X. Therefore, the author should have discussed the arrangement with all roommates, including X, to ensure that the rent is split fairly considering the different room sizes.\n\nIn standard roommate situations, when rooms are different sizes, people usually adjust the rent accordingly based on the size or other factors. If the author and Y made a side deal that changes the effective rent without informing X, that could be seen as unfair. Because X's room size didn't change, but the author's room became smaller, so maybe X is now paying the same as someone in a bigger room. Wait, no: X is in his original room, the author is now in a smaller room, and Y is in the big room. So X's room size hasn't changed. The author's room is smaller, so maybe X is in a similar situation as before. But the payment is between author and Y. If the original rent was split three ways, and Y is paying extra to the author, then Y is effectively paying more than the others. But the total rent remains the same. So if the apartment's monthly rent is, say, $300 per room, each roommate pays $300. But Y gives $30 to the author, so author's net is $270, Y's net is $330, and X pays $300. But that's not fair because the big room should be worth more. If Y is paying $330 for the big room, but X and the author are paying $300, maybe that's fair. However, X is in a room that's smaller than the big one, but same as the author's original. But if the author's room is now smaller than the original one he had, then maybe X is still in the same size as before. \n\nBut the problem is that X didn't agree to this arrangement. The author made a deal with Y without consulting X, which could be seen as unfair. Because in a sense, the room assignments and rent splits are a collective agreement. If one person is getting a better deal by switching rooms with another, the others might feel left out. The author is in a better position because he gets $30 extra, but X is in the same position as before. However, X might feel that he's being treated unfairly because the author is getting a discount. But if the original room assignment was random and X didn't participate in that, maybe X has no claim. However, when Y switched rooms, the author should have informed X and perhaps adjusted the overall rent or explained the arrangement. \n\nIn conclusion, the author didn't do anything illegal, but maybe ethically, they should have included X in the agreement. Since the author and Y made a private arrangement without informing X, which affects the perception of fairness among roommates, the author might be at fault for not considering X's perspective. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't involve X in the decision and created an unequal situation without consensus.\n"
