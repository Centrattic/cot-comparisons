Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they're at fault for \"scamming\" their roommate. The setup is that three people moved into an apartment with three bedrooms, one bigger. Initially, there was a contest (a random draw) to decide who gets the bigger room, and the author won. But then the roommate Y asked for the room, and the author agreed to let Y have it if Y paid $30 more per month towards the rent. Now another roommate X is upset because the author is paying less rent and he feels it's unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to check the initial agreement. They had a random draw, which both Y and the author agreed to. The author won, but then Y wanted the room and they renegotiated. The problem is that X wasn't part of this negotiation. So the question is, should the author have included X in the decision-making?\n\nRoommate agreements can be tricky. Typically, if all roommates aren't part of the agreement, it might cause issues. However, in this case, the original draw was between the author and Y. Maybe X didn't care initially, but now that the author is paying less rent because he gave up the bigger room, X is upset. But why would X be paying the same rent as the author? Wait, the apartment's total rent is probably split equally among the three, but if the author is getting a smaller room, maybe they should be adjusting the split. But the author is charging Y $30 more, so maybe the author is keeping that as extra. \n\nIf the original agreement was that each pays an equal share, then the author is effectively getting $30 less from Y's share, which could be unfair to X. Because X is paying the same as the author, but the author is in a smaller room. Alternatively, if the total rent is split three ways, and the author is giving Y $30 of their own money, that might be different. But the way the author described it, they said Y agreed to pay $30 of the author's rent. So maybe the author is getting $30 less from Y, making the author's share lower than X's. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the total rent is, say, $900, each would pay $300. If Y gives the author $30, then the author is paying $270, Y is paying $330. But X still pays $300. That would mean X is paying more than Y, which is unfair. Wait, no\u2014maybe the author is getting Y to pay $30 extra to the author, so the author's total is $300 (from all three) minus $30 from Y, so the author's out-of-pocket is $270? Or is the author transferring that $30 to X?\n\nThe problem here is unclear. But the key point is that the author and Y made a private arrangement without involving X. If the original rent split was equal, then this arrangement might be affecting X's share. If the author is now paying less because they gave up the bigger room, that's not fair to X, who is in a similar-sized room but paying the same as the author who has a smaller room. So X's complaint is that the author is getting a better deal by being in a smaller room and paying less. But in reality, if the rent was split equally regardless of room size, then maybe the author is just getting a better deal by taking a smaller room. But if the author is getting money from Y, that complicates it.\n\nWait, the author says: \"if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me.\" So Y is paying $30 towards the author's rent. That would mean that the author is effectively charging Y $30, so the total rent remains the same for each roommate, but the author is getting $30 from Y. So if the total rent is $900, each should pay $300. If Y gives the author $30, then the author's actual out-of-pocket is $270, while Y's is $300 plus $30 to the author, totaling $330. But then X is paying $300. So X is paying the same as before, but Y is paying more. However, X is now in the same room size as the author, but the author is getting $30 from Y. If the author is using that $30 for themselves, then X is still paying $300, which might be more than their fair share if the rooms are different sizes. But if the original agreement was that everyone pays equal rent regardless of room size, then the author's arrangement with Y is causing an imbalance. However, if the author is redistributing the $30 to X, then it might be fairer. But the author didn't mention that. So it seems like the author is keeping the $30, which makes X pay the same as before, but the author is getting a discount. That's probably why X is upset.\n\nSo the core issue is that the author and Y made a private agreement that affects X without consulting him. Roommate agreements should ideally be mutual. If the room sizes affect the rent, then all roommates should agree on how to split the rent. The author's deal with Y unilaterally changed the rent distribution, which is unfair to X. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't involve all parties in the decision, leading to an unfair arrangement for X.\n"
