Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves roommates splitting rent and deciding who gets the bigger room.\n\nFirst, the setup: three roommates moving into an apartment with three rooms, one bigger. The author wanted the bigger room, as did Y. Initially, they were going to decide by random.org, which the author won. Then Y asked for it again, and the author agreed to give it up if Y paid $30 extra each month. Now X is upset because the author is paying less.\n\nSo, the key points here. Did the author have the right to negotiate the room switch with Y? When they first decided the room allocation, they used a random method. Then later, Y approached the author and they made a private agreement. \n\nBut X wasn't part of that negotiation. The problem arises because the rent split isn't based on room size. Normally, roommates might split rent equally unless they agree otherwise. If the bigger room is more valuable, maybe the person in it should pay more. However, in this case, the author and Y made a private agreement where Y pays $30 more for the bigger room. The author is now paying less than X because of that.\n\nX feels it's unfair. The author didn't consult X about this arrangement. So the main issue is whether the author had the authority to make that deal without involving X. If the three roommates had a prior agreement on how to handle room sizes and rent, that would matter. But in this case, they didn't. \n\nThe initial decision was made between two people (author and Y), with X not involved. Then when the deal is made, X isn't part of it. So from X's perspective, it seems like the author is getting a better deal at his expense. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the agreement between author and Y is valid. If the total rent is split equally among three, but the author is effectively paying less because Y is covering $30 of the author's share, then X is paying the same as the author but with a smaller room. That's a problem. \n\nHowever, the arrangement between the author and Y might be seen as a private agreement. But since the original rent split wasn't adjusted, X is now contributing the same as the author but with a smaller room. The author's action could be seen as creating an unequal split without consulting everyone, which is unfair to X. \n\nSo, the author didn't inform X about the deal. X might feel betrayed because he was part of the initial decision (when they rolled the random generator), but the subsequent agreement was made without him. Therefore, the author is at fault for not involving X in the negotiations. The correct approach would have been to propose the arrangement to all roommates to ensure fairness. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
