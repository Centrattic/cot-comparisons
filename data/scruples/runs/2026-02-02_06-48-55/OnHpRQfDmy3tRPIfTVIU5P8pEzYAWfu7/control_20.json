Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (they) is at fault for scamming their roommate. The situation involves room assignments and rent splitting.\n\nFirst, the setup: three roommates, three rooms. One room is 40% bigger. They randomly decided who gets the big room, and the author won. Then, after a few days, another roommate (Y) changed their mind and offered to pay an extra $30 a month so the author would give up the big room. The author agreed. Now, the third roommate (X) is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less rent. X claims the author is scamming him.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness in room assignments and rent division. When they first moved in, they used a random generator to decide the big room. The author got it. Then Y wanted to switch and paid extra. But X didn't participate in that agreement. Now, X feels shortchanged because he's in a smaller room and paying the same.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider typical roommate agreements. Usually, rent is split equally unless there's an agreement to adjust based on room sizes. If the rent isn't split based on room size, then the author's arrangement with Y might be problematic because it affects X's payment. But the author didn't change the overall rent structure; only Y is paying extra to switch rooms. However, X is in the same position as before\u2014his room size and rent didn't change. The issue is that X feels the author is getting an unfair advantage by having a bigger room and paying less, but the original agreement was based on a random selection. The author then allowed Y to switch by paying them directly. \n\nWait, but the author says \"you can have the room instead of me\" and Y agreed. So, does that mean the author is taking $30 from Y each month? If the total rent is split equally among all three, but the author is getting paid $30 from Y, that would mean the author is effectively paying $30 less out of their own pocket. But if the total rent isn't adjusted, then X is still paying the same as before. \n\nSo, if the total rent is fixed, and the author is getting $30 from Y, that might not affect X's share. But X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is in a bigger one for the same rent. However, the author originally got the big room through a fair random draw. The fact that Y later offered to switch by paying extra seems like a voluntary agreement between the author and Y. \n\nBut the problem is that the total rent division wasn't adjusted. If they all split the total rent equally, then the author is effectively keeping the $30 from Y, which might mean that the author's share of the rent is lower than others. Wait, let me clarify the finances. If each roommate pays a third of the total rent, and Y gives the author $30 to get the big room, then the author's total contribution is their third plus the $30 from Y? Or is it that the author is allowing Y to take the big room by transferring $30 to the author, so the author's rent is effectively reduced by $30?\n\nIf the total rent is, say, $1000/month, each would normally pay about $333.33. If Y gives the author $30 so the author can let Y have the big room, then the author's net payment is $333.33 - $30 = $303.33, while Y pays $333.33 + $30 = $363.33. X still pays $333.33. So X is paying the same as before, but the author is now paying less because of the arrangement with Y. \n\nBut X didn't consent to this arrangement. He might feel that the total rent should be adjusted so that everyone's contribution reflects the room they have. If the big room is worth more, maybe the rent should be split based on room size. However, in the original setup, they didn't do that; they used a random draw. The author then allowed a switch with Y, which created an imbalance because the rent wasn't adjusted accordingly. \n\nSo, the issue is whether the author should have included X in the agreement. If the author and Y made a side deal that affects the overall fairness of rent splitting, then X has a valid point. The author's $30 payment from Y effectively reduces their own share compared to X's, even though X's room size didn't change. \n\nIn many roommate situations, if rooms are different sizes, the rent is split proportionally. The original random selection might have been fair, but the subsequent switch without adjusting the rent structure could be seen as unfair to X. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't address the overall rent distribution when allowing Y to switch, which created an imbalance that affects X.\n"
