Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they moved in with two roommates. The apartment has three rooms, one bigger than the others. Initially, when deciding who gets the big room, the user and Y wanted it. Y didn't want a bidding war because they don't earn as much, so they did a random draw using random.org, and the user won. But then Y came back after three days and wanted the room for their bed. The user agreed to let Y have the room if they paid $30 extra each month, and Y agreed.\n\nNow, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the user is paying less rent. X thinks the user is scamming him. The question is whether the user is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the original agreement was a random draw for the big room. The user won and took the room. Then, Y wanted to take it over and they made a deal where Y pays $30 more. But X wasn't part of that negotiation. X is now upset because he's not getting the same deal.\n\nWait, the problem is that all three roommates are splitting the rent equally, but the user is effectively paying $30 less because Y is giving them $30. So X thinks it's unfair. But the user and Y made a side agreement. The initial allocation was supposed to be based on the random draw, but then they changed it. Did the original agreement include any mention of rent differences based on room size? Probably not. The user and Y's deal to transfer $30 might be a private arrangement, but if the total rent paid by all three is the same, then X is effectively paying more per person. \n\nBut the issue is whether the user had the right to negotiate that deal without involving X. If the initial decision about the big room was done without X's input, and X didn't have a claim to it, then maybe the user isn't in the wrong. However, if the initial arrangement was supposed to be fair for all three, then changing it to give Y the big room and creating a financial imbalance might upset the original agreement. Also, X's argument is that he's in a smaller room and paying the same rent as the user, but the user is getting a financial benefit. \n\nSo, maybe the problem is that the user and Y changed the arrangement without considering X's position. The user and Y's agreement might not take into account that the rent structure is now unequal from X's perspective. If all three are supposed to be paying the same, but the user is effectively paying less, that could be unfair to X. \n\nAlternatively, if the total rent paid by each person isn't actually the same, because Y is giving $30 to the user, then maybe the user and Y are handling their own finances. But if the apartment's rent is split equally among all three, then the user is paying $30 less while in a bigger room, which X might see as unfair. Wait, no\u2014if the user is in the big room and Y is in the smaller one, but the user is receiving $30 from Y, that could mean the user's share is effectively reduced. However, if the actual rent paid to the landlord is the same for all, then the user is still getting a bigger room for less. But if the user is not the one paying the landlord, but the $30 is between them, then maybe the actual rent division isn't affected. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The key points are: the initial allocation was random, then a deal was made between user and Y without X being involved. X feels left out and that the user is getting an unfair advantage. The user might not be in the wrong if the agreement between them and Y is valid, but perhaps the problem is that the original allocation method (random draw) was supposed to be the way to settle it, and then changing it later without consulting X could be seen as unfair. Also, if the rent isn't split proportionally based on room sizes, then X might be paying more for a smaller room. \n\nSo the user's actions might be considered in the wrong because they didn't include X in the decision-making process, leading to an imbalance. Or maybe not, since X didn't express interest in the big room initially. The user and Y decided to swap with a financial arrangement, which is a common practice in roommate situations. But if X wasn't part of that agreement and now feels the rent split is unfair, perhaps the user should have made sure that the arrangement was fair to everyone. \n\nI think the answer might hinge on whether the original agreement was supposed to be a one-time allocation or if subsequent changes require consensus. If the user and Y made a deal without considering X's position, then X's complaint is valid. However, if X didn't care about the room sizes and was okay with the initial random draw, then maybe the user isn't in the wrong. But since X is now upset, the user might need to address it. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user isn't in the wrong because they followed through with a fair process (random draw), and then a voluntary exchange with Y. The problem is that the rent structure isn't adjusted to reflect room sizes, leading to perceived unfairness. The user might not be at fault, but the situation could have been handled better by adjusting the rent splits accordingly. \n\nHmm. I'm leaning towards the user not being in the wrong (B) because the agreement with Y was voluntary and followed a fair initial process. However, the user might not have considered the effect on X's rent distribution. But since X wasn't part of the initial room allocation (he didn't want the big room), maybe the user isn't responsible for his current complaint. \n\nWait, but the user and Y's deal could create an imbalance in how the rent is effectively split. If the total rent paid by all is the same, but the user is in a bigger room and getting $30 from Y, that could be a problem if the rent isn't adjusted for room sizes. If the apartment's rent isn't split based on room sizes, then maybe the user is getting an unfair advantage. However, roommates often have informal agreements, so maybe it's okay. \n\nThe core issue is whether the user had the right to negotiate that deal without involving X. Since X didn't have any prior claim to the big room (he didn't express interest), maybe the user and Y can make their own arrangement. But if the deal affects X's financial burden, then maybe the user should have included X in the discussion. \n\nBut the user's reasoning was that Y couldn't pay as much as the user, so they went for a random draw. Then, when Y wanted to take the room, they made a deal. The problem is that the user's payment from Y isn't part of the overall rent split, so X is paying the same as the user, but the user is in a bigger room. That might be unfair to X. However, if the user isn't the one paying the landlord, but Y is covering $30, then maybe the user isn't getting an unfair benefit. \n\nThis is tricky. I think the user isn't in the wrong because they followed a fair process and made a voluntary agreement with Y. The issue is more about the rent split not accounting for room size, but that's a separate matter. So the answer is B.\n"
