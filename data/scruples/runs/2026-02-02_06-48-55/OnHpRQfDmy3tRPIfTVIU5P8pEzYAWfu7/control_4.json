Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is at fault here. The situation involves roommates splitting rent in an apartment with three different sized rooms. The big room is 40% bigger than the others. Initially, the author arranged a random draw with Roommate Y to determine who gets the big room. The author won, but after a few days, Y wanted to switch and offered to pay an extra $30/month for the room. The author agreed, so Y got the big room and the author gets $30 less in rent.\n\nNow, Roommate X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less. The author didn't involve X in any of the initial discussions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. The author and Y decided the room allocation through a random draw, which seems fair. Then, after Y wanted to switch, they made an agreement where Y pays an extra $30. The author isn't collecting that $30 as profit; instead, it's part of the rent split. So the author's rent is reduced by $30 because Y is paying more. That means the total rent is still split among all three roommates, but the author ends up paying less because of the room size preference.\n\nBut here's the problem: X wasn't part of this agreement. The author didn't consult X when making the deal with Y. Now X feels like he's being treated unfairly because he's in a smaller room but paying the same as Y. However, the author and Y's arrangement is a private agreement between them. If X had concerns about the room size, he should have participated in the initial allocation. The author didn't do anything to prevent X from joining the discussions. \n\nAnother angle: when the author first asked who wanted the big room, X said he didn't care. So maybe X assumed the big room would be allocated via a random draw, which he didn't object to. Then, when the author and Y made the switch, X wasn't involved. But X's main grievance is that he's paying more despite having a smaller room. However, the author's rent is lower because of the agreement with Y, but the total rent is split among three people. If the author is paying less, then the other two (X and Y) must be paying more collectively. Wait, actually, the way the author describes it, Y agreed to pay $30 extra each month. So, does that mean Y's rent is higher by $30, and the author's rent is lower by $30? If the total rent remains the same, then the author is paying $30 less, and Y is paying $30 more than he would have. But X's share is based on the remaining amount? Or is the total rent divided into three parts, and Y is adding an extra $30 to the author's share? The way the author phrased it: \"you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" So if the author gives up the big room, Y pays $30/month to the author. But that seems odd because the author would be getting money from Y, but that might not be part of the total rent. Wait, maybe the author is reducing their own rent by $30 because Y is effectively paying more. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the total monthly rent is, say, $1500, and originally each roommate paid $500. If the author was in the big room and paying $500, then X and Y each paid $500. After the switch, Y wants the big room and pays an extra $30. So maybe the total rent is adjusted so that Y pays $530, author pays $470, and X still pays $500. Then the total is $1500. But X is now paying the same as before, while the author is paying less. X feels unfair because he's in a smaller room but paying the same as Y. However, the author's arrangement with Y is a personal agreement. The problem is that X didn't participate in the initial allocation. If the author and Y had a private agreement to adjust rent based on room preferences, but X wasn't involved, then X's grievance is valid? Or not?\n\nIn roommate situations, typically, all roommates should agree on the terms of rent splitting. If the author and Y made an agreement that affects the total amount each person pays, and X wasn't part of that agreement, then X might feel it's unfair. But the original allocation was via a random draw. If X didn't care and didn't participate in the initial allocation, maybe he's responsible for his own choice. However, when the author and Y changed the setup, X wasn't consulted. So the author didn't consider X's feelings or include him in the discussion, which could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut from a fairness standpoint, if the author and Y are adjusting their rent between themselves, as long as the total rent is covered and X's share isn't affected, maybe it's okay. However, in this case, if Y is paying $30 extra, that would mean the author is receiving $30 from Y, but that's not part of the total rent. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If the author is in a room that's smaller than the big one, but Y is paying an extra $30 to have the big room, that suggests that the author is effectively giving up the better room in exchange for $30/month. But how does that translate to rent? Maybe the total rent is split equally, but Y is contributing an extra $30 to the author. So the author and Y each have a private agreement, but X isn't part of it. X is still paying the same amount as before. \n\nIn that case, X's grievance is that he's in a smaller room but paying the same as Y, who is in the bigger room. But the author is getting $30 from Y, so perhaps the author's rent is adjusted. Wait, maybe the author is paying less rent because Y is effectively covering part of the author's rent. For example, if the total rent is $1500, and each was supposed to pay $500. Now, Y pays $530, author pays $470, X pays $500. Then the author is getting $30 less rent, but that's because Y is paying more. But X is still paying $500. So X is in a smaller room but paying the same as Y. That's where the problem comes from. X feels he's being treated unfairly because he didn't get a chance to bid for the big room or negotiate. \n\nThe author's actions were to first determine the big room via a random draw, then later allow Y to take it by paying $30/month. The author didn't consult X during these steps. X's complaint is that the author didn't include him in the decision-making process, leading to an unequal situation where X is in a smaller room and pays the same as Y. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be at fault for not considering X's perspective. Even though the initial allocation was via a random draw, changing the terms later without consulting all roommates could be seen as unfair. Roommate agreements typically require consensus, especially when it affects rent distribution. By making a deal with Y without involving X, the author created a situation where X feels disadvantaged. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't include X in the discussions, leading to an unequal arrangement that affects X's perception of fairness.\n"
