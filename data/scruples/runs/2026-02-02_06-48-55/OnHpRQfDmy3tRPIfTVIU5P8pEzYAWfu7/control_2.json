Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're at fault for charging a roommate $30 extra to switch rooms. The apartment has three bedrooms, one bigger than the others. Initially, there was a lottery to decide who gets the big room, and the author won. But later, the other roommate (Y) wanted the big room and offered $30 per month for it. The third roommate (X) is upset because he ended up paying the same as the author but in a smaller room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. When they moved in, the author and Y decided to use a random generator to assign the big room. The author won, so that's how the rooms were split. Then, after a few days, Y wanted to switch. The author agreed to let Y have the big room if he paid $30 more each month. \n\nNow, X is upset because he didn't get a say in this arrangement. The key issue here is whether the author had the right to make that deal with Y without consulting X. If X was part of the original agreement to randomize the room assignment, then he might feel excluded when the author renegotiated. \n\nIn roommate situations, fairness is subjective. If all three agreed to the initial lottery, the author was entitled to the big room. But by allowing Y to pay extra to switch, the author is effectively creating a different financial arrangement that affects X. X's argument is that the author is getting an unfair advantage by paying less rent for the same-sized room. \n\nHowever, the author didn't necessarily do anything illegal. Roommates often have informal agreements. The problem is more about fairness and communication. If the author didn't inform X about the $30 arrangement, that could be the issue. X might feel that the rent split isn't equitable because one roommate is paying less for a better room. \n\nAnother angle is whether the initial agreement allowed for room switches. If the author and Y could change the arrangement without X's consent, then X's grievance is valid. The author should have included X in the discussion to maintain fairness and transparency. \n\nIn many cases, when roommates have different sized rooms, they adjust the rent accordingly. But if the original agreement didn't account for that, and the author started a new arrangement without consulting everyone, it could be seen as unfair. X's perspective is that the author is benefiting from an unequal split without justification. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be in not involving X in the decision-making process and not having a clear agreement with all parties. Even if the $30 deal was fair between the author and Y, excluding X could be seen as the problem. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not being transparent with X and not ensuring that all roommates were on board with the financial arrangement.\n"
