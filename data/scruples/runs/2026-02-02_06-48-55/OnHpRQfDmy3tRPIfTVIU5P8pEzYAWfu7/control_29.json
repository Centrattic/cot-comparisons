Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for essentially charging a roommate to switch rooms.\n\nFirst, the initial agreement was a random draw between Y and the author, both wanting the bigger room. The author won and took the big room. Then Y, after getting the smaller room, offered to pay $30 extra monthly to switch. The author accepted, so Y now has the big room and the author gets $30 less.\n\nNow, X is upset because he's in the same size room but paying more. The issue here is whether it was fair to charge Y without involving X. The problem is that the original setup had three people, but the author only considered Y and themselves in the room assignment. X wasn't part of the initial decision, so he feels excluded and unfair treatment.\n\nThe key points are: Was the initial agreement between all three roommates? Did the author have the right to charge Y to switch rooms without X's input? Typically, in roommate situations, any changes in room assignments or rent splits should involve all parties. Since the author and Y made an agreement that affected X's share of the rent, X might feel that his input was necessary. The author's action could be seen as unfair to X because it altered the rent distribution without his consent. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not including X in the decision-making process, leading to an unequal split that X didn't agree to.\n"
