Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about dividing a bigger room among roommates.\n\nFirst, the setup: three roommates, one big room and two smaller ones. The person (let's call them Z) wanted the big room. Initially, they tried random selection, but then after a few days, their roommate Y wanted it more due to a bed issue. So Z offered to switch if Y paid $30 extra each month. Y agreed. Now X is upset because Z is paying less rent even though they have the same room size.\n\nSo, the main issue is about fairness in the arrangement. Let's break it down step by step. \n\nWhen they first moved in, there was a conflict over the big room. Z and Y both wanted it. They used random.org to decide, and Z got it. That seems fair, as it's a random method to settle a disagreement. Then, Y later wanted to switch, and Z agreed to switch for $30/month. Y agreed to this arrangement. \n\nNow, X is upset because he's paying the same rent as Z but Z is getting an extra $30. X feels this is unfair. The question is whether Z is in the wrong here.\n\nKey points to consider:\n\n1. **Original Agreement:** The initial decision was made through a random draw, which both Z and Y agreed to. Then, Y approached Z and they came to a mutual agreement to switch the room for an extra $30. Since Y agreed to this, it's a voluntary exchange. \n\n2. **Fairness Among All Roommates:** X wasn't part of the initial agreement, so he's not directly involved in the room switch. However, he's now paying the same rent as Z but Z has the advantage of the bigger room without paying more. The problem is that the rent split isn't adjusted to account for the room sizes. \n\n3. **Shared Responsibility in Rent:** Typically, when roommates split rent, it's either equal or adjusted based on room size. Here, the big room is 40% bigger. If the original agreement was equal split, but Z got the bigger room for the same rent, that's not fair. However, Z and Y made a private arrangement where Y pays more to switch. But in this case, Y isn't the one paying more; Z is effectively paying less by giving the room to Y. Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me re-read.\n\nZ says: \"if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me.\" So Y is paying 30$ to Z? Or Y is paying extra to the landlord? Wait, the wording is a bit unclear. Let me check again.\n\nThe user says: \"you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" So Z is saying that if Y pays $30 to Z each month, Y can have the big room. So Z is effectively getting $30/month from Y for giving up the room. But then, the total rent for the apartment is split equally among all three, right? So each pays 1/3 of the total rent. If Z is getting $30 from Y, does that mean Z's share is reduced? Or is the total rent adjusted?\n\nWait, the problem states that Z is now paying $30 less rent. So the original plan was equal rent split. But after the switch, Z is paying $30 less than Y and X. Because Y is paying Z $30/month, so effectively, Z's rent is reduced by $30, and Y's increased by $30. But X is still paying the original amount. So from X's perspective, he's paying the same as Z, but Z has the advantage of the bigger room (since Y has it but pays more). Wait, no. Wait, Z gave up the big room to Y for $30. So now Y has the big room, and Z has a small one. So Z's room is smaller, but Z is paying $30 less. So Z is the one with the smaller room but lower rent. X is still in a small room and paying the original amount. So X's situation hasn't changed. Wait, but X was originally in a small room. So if Z is in a smaller room than X, but paying less... Wait, maybe not. Let me clarify.\n\nOriginal setup: the apartment has 3 rooms. One big (40% bigger), two smaller. Initially, Z won the big room via random.org. Then Y wanted it and convinced Z to switch if Y paid $30/month. Now Y has the big room, Z has a small room. So X is in the other small room. Now, Z is paying $30 less than Y and X. Wait, but how? If the total rent is split equally, each pays 1/3. But if Y is paying Z $30, then Z's effective share is reduced. But maybe the total rent is adjusted? The problem states that Z is paying $30 less, so perhaps the original agreement was equal split, but after the switch, Y pays Z $30/month, so Z's portion is effectively 1/3 - $30, and Y's is 1/3 + $30. But X is still paying 1/3. So from X's point of view, he's paying the same as Z, but Z has a smaller room and pays less. Is that fair?\n\nWait, but if Z is in a smaller room, then the value of Z's room is less. So if the original agreement was equal rent regardless of room size, that's one thing. But if room size affects rent, then it's fair to adjust. However, in this case, the initial arrangement was random, then a private agreement between Z and Y. X wasn't part of that. So X is upset because he's paying the same rent as Z, but Z's room is smaller. But in reality, Z's room is smaller, so they should be paying less. However, the private agreement between Z and Y caused Z to pay less, but perhaps that's not fair to X.\n\nThe core issue is whether the private agreement between Z and Y affects X. If the rent division is supposed to be equal regardless of room size, then Z and Y's arrangement creates an imbalance. However, if the rent is supposed to be adjusted based on room size, then Z is now in a smaller room and should pay less, but X, who has a small room, is paying the same as before. So maybe X is in a worse position now?\n\nWait, let's think: originally, all three had equal rent. Z had the big room, X and Y had small ones. Then Z gave up the big room to Y for $30/month. So now, Y has the big room, Z has a small room. So Z's room is smaller, so the value is less. Therefore, Z should pay less. But X is still in a small room. If the original agreement was equal rent regardless of room size, then maybe that's the issue. But if the agreement was to split rent based on room size, then the current arrangement might be fair. However, since the original agreement was random, maybe the initial rent split wasn't adjusted. \n\nBut the problem is that X is now upset because he's paying the same as Z, but Z has a smaller room. So X's room is the same size as Z's, but Z pays less. That's because Z is getting $30 from Y, so Z's total payment is less. However, X is not part of this arrangement. So from X's perspective, he's in a small room, paying the same as Z, who is also in a small room but pays less. That seems unfair to X.\n\nSo, the question is whether Z should have involved X in the arrangement. The original agreement was among Z and Y. But if the rent is supposed to be split equally regardless of room size, then Z's decision to take $30 from Y to give up the big room creates an imbalance. Because now Z is paying less than X and Y. So even though Z's room is smaller, the fact that Z is getting money from Y to offset their rent makes Z's total payment less than X's. \n\nBut if the room size is a factor in rent, then Z's smaller room should mean they pay less. But X is also in a small room and paying the same as before. So maybe the initial rent split was not adjusted for room size. Therefore, Z and Y's arrangement might not be fair to X. \n\nAlternatively, if the initial agreement was that everyone pays the same regardless of room size, then Z's arrangement with Y is private. However, if the agreement was that rent is split based on room size, then Z's room is smaller, so they should pay less. But X is also in a small room, so why isn't his rent adjusted? \n\nThe confusion here is whether the original rent split was equal or proportional to room size. The original setup doesn't specify. The user says they moved in with the understanding that the big room was to be assigned via random.org. There's no mention of rent being split based on room size. So it's likely that the original plan was equal rent split. \n\nSo when Z and Y made the agreement to switch rooms with Y paying Z $30/month, this effectively changed the rent split. Z is now paying less than X and Y, which creates an unfairness for X. X is still in a small room, paying the same as before, while Z, who is also in a small room, is paying less. \n\nTherefore, Z's action of taking $30 from Y to switch rooms is causing an imbalance in the rent between Z and X. Since X wasn't part of the agreement, he's being disadvantaged. Therefore, the author (Z) is in the wrong because they should have adjusted the rent for all parties, not just between themselves and Y. By accepting $30 from Y, Z is effectively getting a discount on their rent, which isn't fair to X who is paying the same amount for a room of the same size. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). The reasoning is that the private agreement between Z and Y disrupted the original equal rent split, creating an unfair situation for X. The author should have considered how their arrangement would affect X and perhaps adjusted the overall rent split to maintain fairness among all three roommates.\n"
