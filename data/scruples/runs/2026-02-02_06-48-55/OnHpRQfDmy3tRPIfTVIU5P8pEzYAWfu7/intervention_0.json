Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their situation with their roommate. Let me break down the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: three roommates moving into an apartment with three bedrooms. The big room is 40% larger. Before moving in, the author (let's call them Z) asks roommates X and Y who wants the big room. X says they don't care, Y really wants it. Z also wants it. They decide to use a random number generator (random.org) to determine who gets it. Z wins. So, the big room is now Z's.\n\nThen, three days later, Y comes back saying they need the big room for their bed. Z offers a deal: if Y pays Z $30 a month, Z will give up the big room. Y agrees. Now, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and Z is paying less rent. X claims Z is scamming him.\n\nSo, the question is whether Z is in the wrong. Let's look at the key points.\n\n1. **Initial Agreement**: The room assignment was determined by a random draw between Z and Y. X didn't contest this at the time. He just said he didn't care. So, the initial allocation was fair as per their agreement.\n\n2. **Y's Request**: Three days later, Y changes their mind. Z offers a compensation deal. Since Y agreed, the swap is a private agreement between Z and Y. But here's the catch: if the total rent for the apartment is split equally among the three roommates, then each roommate pays the same base amount. However, Z is now effectively paying less overall because Y is subsidizing part of their rent through the $30/month. That might be why X is upset because he's paying the same as Z, but Z isn't contributing as much.\n\n3. **X's Argument**: X is upset because he feels the deal between Z and Y affects his share. But X wasn't part of the original agreement. The problem is whether the agreement between Z and Y is valid without X's consent. If the total rent for the apartment is fixed, then each roommate's share is a third. If Z is getting the big room for less because Y is paying $30 more to Z, that's an internal arrangement. But if the apartment's rent is divided equally, then Z is essentially getting a discount, which X might see as unfair. However, unless the original agreement specified that room sizes affect rent, it's possible that the base rent is split equally regardless of room size. That could lead to the current situation where Z is in a bigger room but paying less.\n\n4. **Fairness and Communication**: The initial arrangement between Z and Y might not consider X's perspective. If the apartment's total rent is divided equally, then Z's deal with Y might be seen as Z receiving a benefit that's not shared with X. But if the original agreement was that whoever gets the big room pays a premium, then Z's deal might be fair. However, since X wasn't part of the negotiation, he feels left out, which is a valid concern.\n\n5. **Ethical Considerations**: Was the deal between Z and Y transparent? If they made a private agreement without involving X, and that affects the perceived fairness of rent distribution, then it's possible that Z is in the wrong. However, if the total rent paid by each roommate (including the $30 transfer) is equal, then Z and Y are each paying their fair share. But if Z is effectively paying less overall, that's the issue.\n\n6. **Legal vs. Ethical**: Legally, unless there's a lease agreement specifying room assignments and rent distribution, roommates can make private deals. Ethically, it's about fairness and transparency. If X wasn't informed or involved, he might feel excluded. But if the deal is that Y is paying extra to Z to take the smaller room, then maybe it's a fair trade. However, if the apartment's rent is split equally, then Z is in a better position without contributing more, which could be seen as unfair to X.\n\nIn conclusion, the key issue is whether the deal between Z and Y affects the overall rent distribution among all three roommates. If the total each roommate pays (including any internal transfers) is equal, then it's fair. If not, then Z might be in the wrong for creating an unequal payment situation without consensus. Since the problem states that X is paying the same as Z but Z is effectively paying less because of the $30, that's the crux. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the deal affects X's share without his agreement.\n"
