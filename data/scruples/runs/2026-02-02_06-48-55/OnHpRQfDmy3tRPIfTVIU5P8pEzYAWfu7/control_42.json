Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about roommates dividing up the bigger room. The apartment has three rooms, one bigger than the others. Initially, the author and Y wanted the big room. They decided to flip a coin (using random.org) and the author won. Then after three days, Y wanted to switch and offered to pay $30 extra each month. The author agreed, so Y now has the big room and pays more. Now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and thinks the author is scamming him by getting a better deal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the arrangement. When they first moved in, the author and Y both wanted the big room. They decided to randomize who gets it. The author won, but then Y wanted to switch. The author was willing to let Y have it if Y paid $30 more. That seems like a fair agreement because the bigger room is worth more. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if they all agreed to that. But X wasn't part of that agreement. X is now upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less. \n\nBut wait, X didn't initially want the big room. The author and Y had the conflict. X said he didn't care. So maybe the author and Y made an agreement without X's input. But since the room assignments affect all roommates, maybe X feels it's unfair. However, if the others agreed to the arrangement, and X didn't have a claim to the big room in the first place, perhaps the author isn't wrong. \n\nAnother thing is whether splitting rent equally was the original plan. If the original agreement was equal rent split regardless of room size, then the author receiving $30 less would be unfair. But if they had a different agreement where room size affects rent, then the $30 extra from Y makes sense. The problem is that the author changed the rent split without X's consent. However, since X didn't want the big room, maybe it's not the author's fault. \n\nI think the key points are: they had an initial agreement to randomize, then Y wanted to switch and offered to pay more. The author accepted, which is a fair trade. X wasn't part of that negotiation. Unless the original agreement was that all roommates have to agree on such arrangements, but there's no mention of that. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be B (No).\n"
