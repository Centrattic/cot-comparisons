Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is at fault for \"scamming\" their roommate. So the situation is about room assignments and rent splitting.\n\nFirst, the setup: Three people moved into an apartment with three rooms. Two smaller, one bigger. The bigger room is 40% larger. The original plan was to decide randomly, and the author won. But then after three days, the roommate Y wanted the big room and offered to pay $30 extra per month. The author agreed, so Y got the room but now X is upset because he feels the author is getting a better deal.\n\nThe key points here are agreements and fairness. Initially, they decided to use a random number generator, which is fair. The author got the big room. Later, Y wanted to swap, and they agreed on a monetary arrangement. The author then keeps the financial benefit, leading X to be upset because he's paying the same as the author but with a smaller room. X feels the author is taking advantage by not sharing the arrangement with him.\n\nNow, considering roommate agreements. When they moved in, they probably split the rent evenly. But when Y pays the author $30, it's an informal arrangement. This might not be fair to X, who is still paying the same as the author. If the total rent is split equally among three people, each pays a third. If Y is paying the author $30, the actual rent they're paying is different. So the author is effectively getting more value (the bigger room) without paying more, while Y is paying both their share and $30 to the author. X is stuck paying the same as the author, which he perceives as unfair.\n\nIs there an agreement among all roommates about how to handle room assignments and rent? If they didn't have a prior agreement, the author's decision to accept $30 from Y could be seen as creating an unfair advantage. Roommate agreements usually require transparency. By not involving X in the decision-making process, the author might have acted in their own interest without considering the impact on X. Even though the initial random assignment was fair, changing it later without adjusting the rent for everyone could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the term \"scamming\" is strong, but the issue is more about perceived fairness. The author isn't necessarily doing anything illegal, but the arrangement may not be equitable for all roommates. If X had agreed to a different rent structure, like splitting based on room size, the situation would be different. But since they didn't, and the author is benefiting from an informal agreement that doesn't include X, it's possible the author is at fault for not considering the overall fairness to all roommates.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they made a private agreement that created an imbalance in the shared living costs without consulting the third roommate, leading to unfairness in the perceived distribution of rent and room sizes.\n"
