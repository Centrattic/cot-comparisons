Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates and the allocation of a bigger room. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the person moved into an apartment with two others. There are three rooms, one 40% larger. Before moving in, they asked who wanted the big room. One roommate (Y) wanted it, but didn't want a bidding war because of income differences. They decided to flip a coin (using random.org), and the author won. So initially, the big room was assigned to the author through a random draw.\n\nThen, after three days, Y changed their mind and wanted the room back. The author agreed that Y could take the room if they paid $30 extra each month. Y agreed. Now, another roommate (X) is upset because he feels it's unfair that the author is paying less rent per square meter. X is accusing the author of scamming him by getting a better deal without involving him.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong here? Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the initial allocation was done fairly. A random draw was used because Y didn't want a bidding war. The author won the draw, so they had a legitimate claim to the big room. Then, after a few days, Y wanted to trade. The author offered a $30 monthly payment for the room. Since the room is bigger, maybe the rent should be split based on room size. But the initial arrangement didn't specify that. The original agreement was a random draw, and the author had the room. Then, when Y wanted it back, the author set a price. Y agreed to the terms. \n\nNow, the problem is that X is upset because he's in a smaller room and paying the same as the author, who is in the bigger room but with a $30 discount. But the key point is that X wasn't part of the negotiation. The original decision was between the author and Y. The author didn't involve X in the initial allocation or the subsequent trade. However, the author's actions with Y don't necessarily affect X's situation unless there was a prior agreement about rent distribution based on room size. If the original understanding was equal rent split regardless of room size, then the author's deal with Y might disrupt that. But if the initial allocation was agreed upon (random draw), and then the trade was mutually agreed between the author and Y, maybe X should have spoken up earlier.\n\nBut here's a potential problem: if the total rent for the apartment is fixed, and the author and Y are adjusting their contributions based on the room, that could change the amount X is effectively paying. For example, if the total rent is $X, and the author is paying $Y - $30, then X might end up covering the difference, which could be unfair. But the original question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe author didn't force the deal on X. The deal was between the author and Y. If the total rent paid by all three is the same, but the author is paying less, maybe that's because Y is paying more. However, if the rent wasn't supposed to be adjusted based on room size, then the author and Y's arrangement could be seen as altering the original agreement without X's consent. \n\nIn roommate situations, usually, all roommates agree on how rent is divided. If the initial method was random assignment with equal rent split, then changing that to have different payments based on room size without consulting all roommates could be problematic. The author might have breached an implicit agreement by allowing Y to take the bigger room with a different payment structure without involving X in that decision. X's anger comes from not being included in the process and feeling that the rent distribution is now unfair. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they made a deal with Y that affects the overall rent distribution without consulting X. Even if the initial assignment was fair, changing the payment terms after the fact without the consent of all roommates could be seen as unfair. The author should have considered the impact on X and discussed the arrangement with everyone. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong)."
