Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, three people moved into an apartment with three rooms. One room is 40% bigger. Before moving in, the original poster (OP) and roommate Y wanted the bigger room. They discussed options: either random selection or highest bidder. Y thought paying extra wouldn't be fair because of income differences, so they rolled a random number generator. OP won and got the big room.\n\nThen, after three days, Y changed his mind and wanted the big room. OP agreed to let Y have it if Y paid $30 extra per month towards OP's rent. Y agreed. Now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and OP is effectively paying less rent. He's calling OP a scammer.\n\nSo the question is, is OP wrong here? Let's think about fairness and agreements. Initially, the big room was assigned via a fair random method, which both OP and Y agreed to. Then Y came back later and wanted to change it. OP offered a financial arrangement: Y pays $30 extra so OP gets less rent, and Y gets the bigger room. Y agreed. That seems like a mutual agreement.\n\nBut X, who didn't participate in the initial decision, is now upset. He wasn't part of the negotiation between OP and Y. The problem here is whether the financial arrangement between OP and Y affects X. If the total rent paid by all three is fixed, then OP's payment being reduced by $30 means X and Y are effectively paying more. So X is paying the same amount but OP is getting credit from Y, which could make X feel it's unfair.\n\nBut was OP wrong to make that deal? The initial agreement was between OP and Y. X wasn't part of it. However, if the total rent is split equally, then by OP getting $30 from Y, the total rent distribution changes. Maybe X feels he should have been included in the decision to share the big room's value. However, the initial allocation was random, and then a new agreement was made between two roommates. \n\nThe key point is whether the agreement between OP and Y is valid without involving X. If the apartment's rules or the lease allow for such arrangements, then OP isn't in the wrong. But if the lease requires all roommates to agree on such changes, then OP might be at fault. However, the scenario doesn't mention any lease terms. \n\nAlso, when Y wanted the room, OP offered a solution that Y accepted. That seems fair since both parties agreed. X's anger might stem from not being included, but the initial problem was between Y and OP. Unless the apartment's rent is divided in a way that affects X's share, which it seems it does because if Y is paying OP $30, then effectively the total rent OP pays is reduced, so X and Y are paying more. But in reality, if Y is giving $30 to OP, then the total amount paid by Y would be his share plus $30. But if the rent is split equally, that's not how it works. Wait, maybe the rent is split equally among all three, so each pays 1/3. If OP is getting $30 from Y, then Y is effectively paying $30 more to OP, which doesn't reduce the total rent paid to the landlord. So the total rent remains the same. But OP is getting money from Y, which is like Y paying OP directly. So OP is getting $30 from Y, which isn't affecting the landlord's rent. So X is paying the same as before, but OP is getting $30 from Y, which might be considered unfair by X. But legally, unless there's a lease agreement that prohibits such side deals, it's allowed. So OP isn't scamming, just making a private agreement. However, X might feel it's unfair, but the fault isn't entirely on OP. \n\nThe problem is whether the agreement between OP and Y is valid without X's consent. Since the lease isn't mentioned, we can't say it's illegal. But in terms of roommate dynamics, OP might have handled it better by including X, but technically, since the initial allocation was random and OP and Y agreed to the swap, OP isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
