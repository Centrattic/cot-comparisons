Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about roommates and renting a big room in an apartment. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, there were three roommates. The apartment has three bedrooms, with one being 40% bigger. Before moving in, the author (let's call them Z) asked X and Y who wanted the big room. X didn't care, Y wanted it. Z also wanted it. They discussed methods: random selection or bidding. Y thought bidding wasn't fair because of income differences, so they rolled a die (random.org) and Z won.\n\nThen, after three days, Y changed their mind and wanted the big room again. Z offered a deal: Y could have it if he paid $30 extra each month. Y agreed. Now, X is upset because Z is paying $30 less than X for the same size room, even though X didn't originally want the big room. X thinks Z is scamming him.\n\nThe user thinks Z is in the wrong. Let me consider the points. Did Z do anything unethical? The initial allocation was fair with a random draw, which both Y and Z agreed to. Then Y wanted to change it. Z offered a compromise where Y could get the big room by paying more. That seems like a mutual agreement. However, X wasn't part of the negotiation. X's issue is that Z and Y changed the arrangement without involving X, leading to unequal rent based on room size. But in the original setup, X didn't want the big room. Now, X is paying the same as Y, but Z is paying less. X might feel it's unfair because he's getting a smaller room but paying the same as Y. Wait, no: the big room is with Z, so X has a smaller room. Y has the big room now, paying $30 more. So X's room is the same size as Y's original one, but now Y has the big one. X is paying the same as Z, but Z is paying $30 less. So X is paying more per square meter than Z? That's the problem.\n\nBut when they first moved in, Z got the big room via random selection. Then Y wanted to trade for $30. The problem is, X wasn't part of the initial negotiation. If the original agreement was that everyone pays the same, then Z and Y changing the rent could be seen as unfair to X. But if the original arrangement was that rent is split equally regardless of room size, then Z's decision to take less rent in exchange for the room might be unfair to X. Alternatively, if the rent was split based on room size proportionally, but they never agreed on that.\n\nThe key point is whether the original agreement allowed for unequal rent. If the initial setup was equal rent, then Z and Y changing the arrangement might not have considered X's position. But X didn't participate in the negotiation, so maybe Z should have included X. However, X didn't want the big room in the first place. Maybe X is upset because he's now in a smaller room but paying the same as Y, who has the bigger room. If the total rent is split equally, then Z and Y's arrangement would mean Z is effectively getting a bigger room for less, which might not be fair to X. But if the total rent is split equally, then Y is paying more than their share by $30, and Z is paying less. So maybe the total rent is supposed to be split equally, but Z's arrangement with Y is causing an imbalance.\n\nAlternatively, if the original agreement was that whoever is in the big room pays a proportionally higher share. For example, if the big room is 40% bigger, maybe they agreed to adjust rent accordingly. If that wasn't discussed, then Z's arrangement with Y might be causing an inequity. But since X didn't want the big room, he ended up in a smaller one. So if the rent is split equally, X is paying the same as Y (who now has the big room) but Z is getting the big room for less. But no, wait: after the trade, Y is in the big room and paying 30$ more. So Z is in a smaller room and paying 30$ less. So perhaps X is now in a medium room, same as before, but Z is in the small room. Wait, the initial setup had Z getting the big room. Then Y took it by paying 30$ extra. So now Y is in the big room, Z is in a smaller room. X is still in their original room. So X's situation hasn't changed. The problem is that Z is paying $30 less than before, which might affect X's share. If the total rent is fixed, then if Z is paying less, X and Y must adjust. But if the total rent is split equally, then Z's reduction would require others to pay more. Wait, maybe the original rent was split equally among three people. If Z is now paying $30 less, then the total rent would have to be adjusted. But if the total rent is fixed (like the landlord charges a fixed amount), then Z's $30 less would mean that the total rent is not being covered. That doesn't make sense. So perhaps the initial total rent is divided equally. Let's say the total rent is $X. Each pays $X/3. Now, Z and Y are adjusting their shares. If Z is paying $30 less, then the total rent would be Z paying (X/3 - 30) plus Y paying (X/3 + 30), but X's payment remains X/3. That would make the total rent (X/3 -30) + (X/3 +30) + X/3 = X. So the total is still the same. So the arrangement between Z and Y is a redistribution between themselves, not affecting X. But X is now in a smaller room than the big one? No, X was in a medium room initially. Wait, the big room is 40% bigger than the other two. So if the initial allocation was Z in big, Y and X in small. Then Y traded with Z to get the big room. Now Y has the big room, Z has a smaller one. X is still in their original room. So X's room size hasn't changed. So X's issue is that he's paying the same rent as Y, who now has the bigger room. If the original rent division was equal, then X is in a smaller room but paying the same as Y, who has a bigger room. That's unfair to X. But X didn't want the big room initially. The problem is that the arrangement between Z and Y didn't consider X's room size. If the original agreement was that room size doesn't affect rent, then X's situation is the same. But if the original agreement was that bigger room means higher rent, then X's payment wasn't adjusted. However, since X didn't participate in the negotiation, he's now in the same room but paying the same as Y, who has a bigger room. So maybe Z and Y's arrangement is unfair to X. But Z didn't do anything wrong by negotiating with Y, unless the original agreement required all three to agree. If the original agreement was that whoever is in the big room pays more, then Z and Y's arrangement is okay. But if the original agreement was equal rent regardless, then Z and Y's deal might be problematic. The problem is whether the original agreement allowed for such a trade. Since the user says that when they moved in, they decided via random.org, and then later Y and Z made a deal. If the original agreement was that the big room's rent would be split proportionally, then maybe the deal is okay. But if the original agreement was equal rent, then the deal between Z and Y affects X's situation. So Z's in the wrong because they didn't consider X's position when making the deal with Y. The answer depends on whether the original agreement allowed for such a trade. Since the user didn't mention any prior agreement about rent based on room size, the default might be equal rent. So by allowing Y to pay more for the big room, Z is effectively getting a discount, which might not be fair to X. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't involve X in the negotiation and the deal affects X's situation unfairly.\n"
