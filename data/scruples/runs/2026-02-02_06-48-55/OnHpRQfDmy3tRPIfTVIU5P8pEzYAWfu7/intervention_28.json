Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is at fault for \"scamming\" their roommate. The scenario involves room assignments and money.\n\nSo, the setup is that three people moved into an apartment with three rooms. One room is bigger. The author wanted the big room and decided to have a random draw with the other roommate, Y, who also wanted it. The author won. Then Y later wanted the big room and offered to pay 30$ extra each month for it. The author agreed, so Y got the room and the author gets a discount. Now, the third roommate, X, is upset because he's paying the same rent for a smaller room, and he's accusing the author of scamming him.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, when they moved in, they had a random draw between the author and Y to decide who gets the big room. The author won. Then later, Y offered to pay extra to switch. The author accepted that arrangement. But X wasn't part of that agreement. \n\nNow, X is upset because he's paying more relative to the author. The key here is whether the initial agreement between the author and Y impacted X's rights. If X was part of the original agreement or if he expected to have a say in the room assignments, then the author might not have considered his perspective. \n\nBut when the room was assigned initially, the author and Y decided through a random draw. X didn't express any preference at that time, right? The author mentions that X didn't care when asked who wanted the big room. So maybe X didn't have a problem with the initial arrangement. \n\nThen later, when Y wanted to switch, the author made a private agreement with Y. However, X is now paying the same as the author, but the author is getting a discount via Y's payment. This might create an imbalance in their shared rent. If the total rent is split equally among the three, but the author is effectively paying less because Y is contributing more, that could be unfair to X. \n\nWait, but how was the rent split originally? If the three were splitting the total rent equally, and then Y agreed to pay the author 30$ to take the bigger room, that would mean Y is paying more overall. But X is still paying his share, and the author is getting a discount. This could be seen as the author benefiting in a way that isn't transparent to X or that's not fair. \n\nIs the author allowed to make a private deal with Y that affects the overall payment structure? If the original arrangement was that everyone pays equal rent, and the author is now getting extra money from Y, that might be considered unfair to X. Because X is paying his same portion, and the author is getting an advantage. \n\nBut maybe the author is just transferring the 30$ to their own pocket. However, if the total rent is split equally, the 30$ from Y isn't part of the rent. It's more like a side agreement. But in terms of room size, X is in a smaller room while the author is in a bigger one but paying less. Wait, no\u2014after the switch, Y is in the bigger room, and the author is in a smaller room but getting 30$ from Y. Wait, no. Wait, the author initially had the big room, then agreed to give it to Y in exchange for Y paying 30$ extra each month. So Y is in the big room and paying the same as before plus 30$, while the author is in a smaller room but effectively getting a 30$ discount. \n\nSo the author's rent is now 30$ less than Y's, and X's rent is the same as before. If the total rent is supposed to be split equally, but the author is getting a discount, that might be unfair to X. Because X is paying the same amount as before, but the author is getting a financial benefit from Y. \n\nBut maybe the initial rent split was not based on room size. If the room sizes are different, then the rent should be adjusted accordingly. However, the original agreement might have been to split the rent equally regardless of room size. If that's the case, then the author's arrangement with Y creates an imbalance because Y is effectively paying more for a bigger room, but the author is getting a discount. \n\nBut X wasn't part of that agreement. So if the author and Y made a private deal that affects the overall fairness of the rent split, then X has a valid complaint. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider X's position or inform him about the arrangement. \n\nAlternatively, if the author and Y's agreement is a side deal where Y pays the author directly for the room, but the total rent is still split equally, then the author is profiting at X's expense. Because X is paying the same amount, but the author is getting 30$ extra each month, which isn't part of the original rent agreement. \n\nIn roommate situations, it's important that all parties agree to any changes in room assignments or rent splits. By not including X in the decision, the author might have created an unfair situation where X is paying more relative to the author. \n\nSo, even if the initial draw was fair, changing the arrangement without considering X's input could be problematic. The author might be in the wrong because they should have proposed the arrangement to all roommates, especially since it affects the overall fairness of the rent split. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
