Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates dividing up rent and room assignments.\n\nSo, the setup is that three roommates moved into an apartment with three bedrooms. One room is significantly bigger than the other two. Before moving in, the author and their roommates (X and Y) discussed who would get the bigger room. Y initially wanted it, but when the author suggested a bid or a random draw, Y argued against a bid because of income differences. They ended up using a random number generator, and the author won the big room.\n\nThen a few days later, Y asked to switch, offering to pay $30/month to the author to take the big room. The author agreed. Now, X is upset because he feels the author is charging him $30 less in rent when they both have the same size room, and he's calling the author a scammer. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the initial agreement. The room assignment was decided by a random draw. That seems fair because all parties agreed to it. The author got the big room through that method. But then Y later wanted to switch. The author allowed Y to take the big room in exchange for $30/month. Now, X is upset because he's paying the same rent as the author but the author is effectively getting $30 less because Y is paying that $30 to the author.\n\nWait, but how does the rent split work here? If the total rent is split three ways, and the author is getting $30 from Y, does that mean the author is effectively paying $30 less in rent? That could be the case if the total rent is divided equally and the author is getting money from Y. But if the original agreement was to split the rent equally regardless of room size, then charging someone for the room might be creating an imbalance.\n\nBut here's the thing: the initial room assignment was random. The author was in the big room, Y wanted to switch. The author allowed the switch for $30/month. Now, if the rent is split equally, and the author is receiving $30 from Y, that might mean the author's net cost is lower. However, the original problem is that the rooms are different sizes. So, maybe the correct way to split rent is considering room size. But the initial agreement didn't specify that. The author and Y decided the big room via random draw, so perhaps they didn't account for room size in the rent split.\n\nNow, when Y switched with the author, they made a side agreement where Y pays $30 to the author. If the total rent is divided equally, then Y is paying the same as before (third of the rent) plus $30 to the author, and the author is receiving $30 from Y. So, in effect, the author's total out-of-pocket is the original rent minus $30, while X is paying his third without any adjustment. That creates an unfair situation for X because he's not getting any compensation for his room size. \n\nBut was X part of the original agreement? The initial discussion was between the author and Y. X didn't have a say in who got the big room. The author might have assumed that the random draw was sufficient, but if the rent isn't adjusted based on room size, then X is paying the same as the author, who is getting a bigger room. However, the author gave up the big room to Y for $30, which might mean that the author's room is now the same size as X's. So maybe the problem is that X is now paying more than Y because Y is giving $30 to the author. Wait, no. If the total rent is split three ways, and Y is paying the same amount plus $30 to the author, then Y's total is the same as before, and the author's total is less. So X is paying his third, Y is paying his third plus $30 to the author, and the author is getting $30 from Y. So the author's net cost is lower, and X is paying the same as before. \n\nX is upset because he's effectively paying more than the author. If the original agreement didn't account for room size, then it's possible that the author's arrangement with Y is unfair to X. The author didn't involve X in the decision to charge Y money for the room. Since X didn't agree to this, he might feel it's unfair that the author is getting a financial benefit from the room switch. \n\nAdditionally, the initial allocation of the big room was random. If the room sizes are different and the rent isn't adjusted accordingly, that's a problem. However, the author and Y decided to switch via a side agreement. But since X wasn't part of that agreement, the author's action might be seen as taking advantage of the situation without considering X's equal share. \n\nAnother angle: when the author agreed to let Y take the big room for $30/month, does that mean the author is effectively charging Y for the room, which could be considered rent? If the total rent is split equally, the author might be creating an imbalance by receiving additional money from Y. This could be seen as unfair to X, who isn't part of the arrangement. \n\nIn roommate agreements, it's important that all parties agree on how rent is divided, especially when room sizes differ. If the author and Y made a side deal without X's consent, then X has reason to be upset because the original agreement didn't account for room size, and now there's an unequal distribution of financial responsibility. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't involve X in the initial allocation of the big room and later created a side agreement that affects X's share of the rent without his consent. The key points are that the initial room assignment didn't consider room size in rent division, and the author made a financial arrangement with Y that creates an imbalance with X, who wasn't part of the decision.\n"
