Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about roommates and the big room. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the setup: Three roommates in a three-bedroom apartment. One room is 40% bigger. Before moving in, they discussed who gets the big room. The two others, X and Y, were considering who would take it. The author wanted it, and so did Y. They discussed different methods to decide\u2014random.org or highest bidder. Y didn't want a bidding war because the author has higher income, so they went with a random number generator and the author won.\n\nThen, after three days, Y comes back and wants the room. The author agrees to let Y have it if Y pays $30 extra each month. Y agrees. Now, X is upset because he's paying the same as the author but the author is paying $30 less. X is angry, calling the author a scammer.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. Let's think about roommate agreements and fairness. When they initially decided, X wasn't consulted. The author and Y made the agreement without X's input. But was that their right? Typically, in a shared apartment, all roommates should agree on the terms. However, if the rent is split equally, maybe each person's room size isn't considered. But maybe the original agreement was only between the author and Y, and X wasn't part of that. \n\nWait, the initial problem is about the big room. The room size affects the amount of space each person has. If the rent isn't adjusted based on room size, then maybe the author, who got the bigger room, should be paying more. But in this case, the author originally won the big room, then later let Y take it in exchange for $30. So Y is effectively paying for the bigger room. But X is upset because he's not getting a discount. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for adjusting the rent only between Y and themselves without involving X? If all three roommates split the rent equally regardless of room size, then the author moving to a smaller room and Y moving to the bigger one with a $30 adjustment might be fair between them. However, X wasn't part of that agreement. But X's problem is that he's paying the same as the author, who's in a smaller room. \n\nWait, the author is now in the smaller room, right? Because Y took the big room in exchange for $30. So the author is in a smaller room, but the original rent split was equal. If the total rent is the same, then maybe the author is paying less because they're giving up the big room. But X is paying the same as the author. So perhaps X feels that since the author has a smaller room, X should get a discount too. But the author only adjusted the rent with Y.\n\nSo is the author wrong for not adjusting the rent with X? If the original agreement between the author and Y was that Y pays $30 more to have the bigger room, then maybe that's a private agreement. However, if the total rent is split equally, and the author is effectively paying less because they're in a smaller room, then maybe X is right to be upset. But maybe the author and Y's arrangement is a side agreement. \n\nBut typically, when roommates have different room sizes, the rent is adjusted accordingly. If the apartment is divided into three rooms, but one is bigger, then the person in the bigger room should pay more. However, in this case, the original setup was that everyone pays the same. Then, when the author gave up the big room to Y for $30, Y is effectively paying more. But the author is now in a smaller room and paying the same as X. Wait, no\u2014because the author is letting Y pay $30 to take the big room. So the author is taking $30 less from Y, meaning the author's personal share of the rent is lower. But X is still paying his original share. So maybe X is paying the same as the author, but the author is in a smaller room. \n\nBut if the total rent is split equally, and the author is in a smaller room, then maybe that's a problem. Because the person in the bigger room should be paying more. But in this case, the author is in a smaller room, and Y is in the bigger one, but the author is getting $30 from Y. So effectively, the author is not paying less than X; instead, they are getting money from Y. Wait, no\u2014if the author is getting $30 from Y, then they are effectively paying less total rent. Because the original setup was that all three split the rent equally. If Y is giving the author $30, then the author's actual payment is less. So X is paying the same as the author, but the author is getting money from Y. \n\nBut X isn't involved in that. So maybe X feels that since the author is getting money from Y, that's unfair to him. But is that the case? The author and Y made a private agreement. But if the rent is supposed to be split equally among all three, then the author receiving $30 from Y would mean the author is not paying their fair share to the total, which might be a problem. \n\nAlternatively, if the original rent agreement is that each pays an equal share regardless of room size, then the author's arrangement with Y might be a separate agreement to compensate for the bigger room, which is fair. However, if the total rent is fixed, and the author is taking $30 from Y, that might mean that the author isn't contributing their equal share, which could be unfair to X.\n\nHmm. So maybe the author is at fault because they adjusted the rent with Y but not with X, leading to an unequal distribution of costs. However, if the author's arrangement with Y is that Y is paying extra for the bigger room, then the author isn't necessarily wrong. But perhaps the author should have involved X in the original agreement on how to split the rent considering room sizes. \n\nThe key point here is whether the initial agreement about room assignments and rent was between all three roommates or just between the author and the others. The author initially decided the room assignment with Y without X's input. Then, when Y wanted to switch, the author made a private deal with Y again without X's input. X feels left out, which is valid. If the rent is supposed to be split equally among all three, then any adjustments between two roommates might not be fair to the third. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't involve X in the initial room assignment and the later adjustment. The fairness of the situation depends on whether the rent is adjusted for room size. If the apartment was supposed to be split equally without considering room size, then the author's deal with Y might be unfair to X. However, if the apartment was intended to have different rent based on room size, then the author's arrangement could be fair. But since the original setup didn't specify, the author's actions could be seen as unfair to X. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be at fault for not involving X in the decisions and for creating a situation where X is paying the same as the author, who is now in a smaller room. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
