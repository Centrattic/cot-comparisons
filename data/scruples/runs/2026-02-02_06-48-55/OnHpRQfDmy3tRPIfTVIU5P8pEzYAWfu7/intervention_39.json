Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates and the allocation of a bigger room.\n\nFirst, the setup: Three roommates, one big room and two smaller ones. The author wanted the big room, as did Y. They decided to use a random generator, and the author won. But after three days, Y asked for the room again, offering to pay $30 extra each month. The author agreed, so Y got the big room and the author gets $30 less rent. Now, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and paying the same, while the author is getting a discount.\n\nThe key points here are fairness, communication, and prior agreement. Initially, they used a random method to decide, which seems fair. Then, after the author got the room, Y wanted to change it, leading to a new agreement. But X wasn't part of these negotiations. The problem is that X feels excluded and that the arrangement isn't fair because he's not getting the same benefit.\n\nWas there a prior agreement about how to handle room changes after the initial random allocation? The original decision was between the author and Y, with X not involved. When Y approached the author later, the author made a deal without consulting X. This might have disrupted the existing agreement, especially if the initial random selection was supposed to be final. However, since the author and Y agreed on a new arrangement, maybe it's their right to do so as long as it's mutual. But X's complaint is about the unequal payment, not the room allocation itself.\n\nAnother angle: If all three roommates are splitting the rent equally, but the author is effectively paying less because of the $30, that creates an imbalance. If the total rent is divided equally among three, but the author is getting a discount, others are paying more. That could be seen as unfair, especially if the initial agreement was that the random selection determined who pays what. The author might be exploiting their position to gain financially, which could be considered \"scamming\" in X's view.\n\nBut maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they had a fair process initially and then made a new fair deal with Y. However, the fact that X wasn't involved might mean the author didn't consider the overall fairness to the group. The original problem might have been how they divided the rent. If they all agreed to split the rent equally regardless of room size, then the author giving up the big room for money could be unfair to X, who's in a smaller room but paying the same. Alternatively, if the rent was based on room size, then the author's arrangement with Y might be fairer.\n\nThe core issue is whether the author had the right to negotiate a personal deal without considering the group's agreement. Since X wasn't part of the initial or subsequent negotiations, the author might have acted in a way that benefits themselves and Y at X's expense. The author's action could be seen as self-serving without considering the group's initial agreement, leading to X feeling cheated.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the initial agreement allowed for such a change. If the random selection was supposed to be final, then the author and Y changing it might be okay. But if the overall group agreement was equal rent, then the author's deal creates an unfair split. Since the author didn't communicate with X, it's possible that the author is in the wrong for not considering the group's agreement and for creating an unequal payment structure without X's consent. Therefore, Answer A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
