Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is about roommates splitting an apartment with three rooms. Two smaller rooms and one bigger one. The person (let's call them Z) moved in with roommates X and Y. Before moving in, Y wanted the big room, and when there was a conflict, they decided to use a random generator, and Z won. Then after three days, Y wanted the big room again and offered to pay $30 extra each month so Z could move into a smaller room. Z agreed, and now X is upset because Z is paying less rent even though their rooms are the same size.\n\nFirst, I need to check if there was any agreement beforehand about splitting the rent based on room size. The original setup was that they probably split the rent equally unless they had a different arrangement. The problem arises when Z and Y made a private agreement where Y pays an extra $30 to get the bigger room. X is now upset because he's paying the same as Z, even though his room is the same size as Z's (since Z gave up the big room to Y). \n\nWait, actually, after the switch, Z is in a smaller room, and Y is in the big one. So X is in a smaller room as well? Or did X take the third room? The original apartment has three rooms: two small, one big. Initially, Z got the big room, then gave it to Y for $30 extra. So now, Y has the big room, and Z and X have the small ones. But if the rent is split equally among three people, then each is paying a third. However, if Y is paying an extra $30 to Z, maybe the total rent is adjusted. But the problem is that X isn't part of this agreement. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the agreement between Z and Y is fair to X. If the total rent is divided equally, but Y is paying more for a bigger room, then Z is effectively getting a discount. But X is still paying the same as everyone else. X is upset because he's not getting the same deal. So maybe the problem is that the initial agreement between Z and Y didn't consider X's position. \n\nWhen they decided who got the big room, X didn't have a say. Then, when Z and Y made the $30 deal, X wasn't involved. So if all three are splitting the rent equally, but one person is paying more for a larger room, that might be causing an imbalance. However, in roommate situations, it's common to adjust rent based on room size. But in this case, it seems like the adjustment was only between two roommates, not all three. \n\nAnother angle: when Z and Y made the agreement, they might have thought it's a private deal. But if the total rent paid by all roommates is the same, and Y is paying an extra $30 to Z, that means Y's total contribution is higher. However, if the overall rent to the landlord is the same for everyone, then perhaps this internal agreement is causing an unfair distribution. But if the landlord isn't aware of the $30 difference, then maybe it's a personal agreement between the roommates. \n\nBut X's problem is that he's paying the same as Z, even though Z is in a smaller room. So maybe X feels that he's subsidizing Z's lower rent. If the room sizes are different, then splitting the rent equally is unfair. So perhaps the correct approach would be to adjust the rent based on room size for all roommates. Since Z gave up the big room to Y, maybe Z and X should have a lower rent than Y. But in this case, Z is getting an extra $30 from Y, which might mean that the total rent for Y is higher, but the overall split among the three roommates isn't adjusted. So X is still paying the same as Z, but Z's effective cost is less because of the $30 from Y. That could be why X is upset. \n\nAlso, the initial selection of the big room via random.org was agreed upon by all three? Or just between Z and Y? The original question says that when deciding who gets the big room, X didn't care, Y wanted it. So maybe X thought he would get a small room, and Y would get the big one. But then Z got the big room via random.org, and then later gave it to Y for $30. So X didn't have a say in the second part. \n\nSo the main question is whether the agreement between Z and Y is fair to X. If X wasn't involved in the decision and now feels that the arrangement is unfair because he's paying the same as Z but Z's room is the same size as his, then Z might be in the wrong for not involving X in the decision. However, if the total rent paid by Y is higher (because of the $30), then perhaps that's a separate matter. But if the overall split to the landlord is equal, then X is subsidizing the deal between Z and Y. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that Z is getting money from Y, which effectively makes Z's rent lower than Y's, but X is still paying the same as everyone else. So X is in a worse position. Therefore, Z's action is unfair because it creates an unequal burden on X. \n\nIn roommate situations, it's important that all roommates agree on the terms of the arrangement. Since Z and Y made a private agreement without X's consent, that might be the issue. Even if the original selection was fair, changing the arrangement after the fact without including X could be seen as unfair. \n\nSo the answer might be that the author (Z) is in the wrong because they made a deal with Y that affects X without X's input. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
