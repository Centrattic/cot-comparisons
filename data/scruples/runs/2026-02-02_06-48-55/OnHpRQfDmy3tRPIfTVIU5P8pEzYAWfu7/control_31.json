Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for arranging the big room with their roommate Y by charging $30/month from Y to let Y have the room, leading to a conflict with roommate X.\n\nFirst, the setup: Three roommates in an apartment with three rooms. Two smaller, one bigger. Initially, the author and Y wanted the big room. They decided via random.org, author won. But after three days, Y asked to switch, offering to pay $30 extra. Author agreed, so Y now pays the extra to have the big room. Now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less rent, so he accuses the author of scamming him.\n\nSo, the key points here are the fairness of the room assignment and the agreement between the roommates. Let me think about the initial agreement. Before moving in, they discussed who would get the big room. X didn't care, Y wanted it. They decided via random.org. The author won, so he was in the big room. Then Y came in three days later and wanted to switch. The author agreed to give up the room for $30/mo from Y. So the author got the $30, Y pays more, and X is in a smaller room. \n\nNow, X is upset because he's paying the same as the author but the author is getting $30 less. Wait, no, the author is paying the same as X? Or is the total rent divided equally? The problem statement is that the author is paying $30 less rent. Wait, the original setup: the apartment's total rent is split among the three. If the author was in the big room and then switched, perhaps the rent structure changed. But how? If the author was paying the same as others but got the big room, but after switching, the author is getting $30 less. That implies that the total rent is split such that the author's share is less. But how?\n\nWait, maybe the roommates split the rent based on room size. But the original agreement wasn't specified. The initial random selection was for who gets the big room, but maybe the rent was split equally regardless of room size. If the author was in the big room initially, but after switching, Y is in the big room and paying $30 more. So maybe the author is effectively paying $30 less than Y? But X is in a smaller room and paying the same as the author. That's why X is upset. He feels the author is getting an unfair advantage by taking less rent for a smaller room. \n\nThe key question is whether the initial agreement was fair. When they moved in, the author and Y decided via random.org who gets the big room. That seems fair. Then, after the author won, Y approached again and wanted the room. The author offered a trade: Y pays $30/month to get the room. Y agreed. So the author gave up the room for $30, which Y was willing to pay. The author might have done this because they wanted to be flexible or because Y had a genuine need (bed size). \n\nBut X wasn't part of the initial agreement. He didn't care who got the big room. Now, he's upset that the author is getting a lower rent share. But if the rent split wasn't based on room size, maybe the author is in the right. However, if all roommates are supposed to split the rent equally regardless of room size, then the author giving up their room for a monetary benefit could be seen as unfair to X, who is in a smaller room but paying the same as the author. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the rent was split equally, but after the author gave up the big room, the rent is now adjusted. If Y is paying $30 extra to the author, that could be a side agreement. But if the total rent is still split equally among all three, then the author is effectively making $30 from Y, which might be seen as unfair to X. However, if the author and Y made a separate agreement, maybe that's their business, unless it affects X's rent. \n\nBut the problem is that X is now paying the same as the author but the author is getting $30 less. Wait, the author said \"I am paying 30$ less rent\" which might mean that the author's share of the total rent is reduced. How? If the total rent is fixed, and the author is taking a portion less, that would mean another roommate is paying more. But the author says that Y agreed to pay 30$ of the author's rent. So perhaps the author is getting $30 from Y each month to cover part of their rent. That would mean the author's personal rent is effectively reduced by $30, and Y is paying $30 more. So X is paying the same as before, but the author is paying less, and Y is paying more. \n\nIn that case, X is not part of the agreement. If the initial arrangement was that everyone splits the rent equally, the author's side deal with Y could be seen as unfair to X. Because X is not getting any compensation for being in a smaller room. However, the initial room assignment was determined by random.org, which all roommates agreed to. Then, when Y wanted to switch, the author allowed it for $30. Since X didn't care initially, maybe he shouldn't have a problem now. But X's problem is that he's in a smaller room and the author is getting money for that. \n\nAnother angle: The initial agreement was random. After the author won, they had the right to the big room. Y's request to switch came later. The author had the right to decide whether to switch. If the author agreed to switch for $30, that's a valid agreement. However, if the rent structure was supposed to be equal regardless of room size, then the author is taking advantage by getting extra money from Y. But if the rent wasn't tied to room size, maybe it's fair. \n\nBut if the rent is split equally among all three, and Y is paying $30 to the author, that could create an imbalance. Because the author's rent is effectively reduced, and Y's is increased. X, who is in a smaller room, is not compensated. So X is at a disadvantage. However, X didn't object to the initial random assignment. Now, he's upset after the switch. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the initial agreement allowed for such a side deal. If the roommates agreed that room assignments could be changed with mutual agreement and rent adjusted accordingly, then the author is not in the wrong. But if the initial agreement was that everyone splits the rent equally regardless of room size, then the author's side deal with Y could be considered unfair to X. \n\nBut the original setup didn't specify rent splitting based on room size. The initial random assignment was just about who gets the big room. So the author and Y could have made a separate agreement without affecting X. However, since X is now paying the same as the author, who is in a smaller room, X feels it's unfair. The author might argue that they had the right to switch the room, and the $30 is a fair trade. \n\nIn roommate situations, it's common to adjust rent based on room size if agreed upon. But if there's no such agreement, then splitting equally is standard. The author's action might be seen as taking advantage of the situation, but if they had the right to switch the room, it's their choice. However, if the rent structure was supposed to be equal, the author is getting an unfair benefit. \n\nThe key is whether the author's agreement with Y affects X's share. If the author is effectively paying less rent, and X is paying the same, then X is worse off. If the author and Y's side deal is a separate financial agreement, unrelated to the total rent paid to the landlord, then it's between them. But if the side deal is part of the rent structure (i.e., Y is paying more to the landlord so the author can pay less), then it's a different scenario. \n\nThe problem statement is a bit ambiguous on whether the $30 is part of the total rent or a separate payment. If it's a separate payment (e.g., the author is subletting the room to Y for $30), then the author is making money off the room, which could be problematic. However, if it's an adjustment in how the roommates split the rent (like Y pays an extra $30 to the author, so the total rent to the landlord remains the same, but the author's share is reduced), then the author is effectively getting a discount. In that case, X is paying the same as before, but the author is paying less, which is unfair to X. \n\nIn that scenario, the author might be in the wrong because they are creating an imbalance in the rent splitting. The initial agreement didn't specify that room size affects rent, so X has a right to be upset. The author's agreement with Y creates a disparity in how the rent is split. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't involve X in the decision and created an unequal distribution of rent based on room size without prior agreement.\n"
