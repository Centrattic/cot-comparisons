Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by taking 30$ from their roommate Y to switch rooms. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, there are three roommates: the author, X, and Y. They moved into an apartment with three bedrooms, one of which is 40% bigger. Before moving in, the author asked who wanted the big room. X didn't care, Y wanted it but was worried about their income not being as high as the author's. The author suggested a random draw, which they did using random.org, and the author won the big room.\n\nAfter three days, Y asked if they could have the big room instead if they paid an extra $30. The author agreed to take $30 from Y's share each month so Y could move into the big room. Now X is upset because he thinks the author is scamming him by getting a 30$ lower rent than him.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author have the right to make that agreement with Y? Were all parties aware and okay with the arrangement? When they randomly selected the rooms, was there an agreement on how to handle future changes?\n\nThe author and X might have thought that the initial random draw settled the room assignments. But the author allowed Y to switch by paying $30, which affects X's rent because if there's a fixed total rent divided among three, if Y is paying the author $30, maybe X's share is now less. Or perhaps the author is receiving the $30 from Y, which might mean that X is effectively paying less, hence the complaint.\n\nBut wait, the user says that the author is now paying $30 less. If the total rent is split three ways, and Y pays the author $30, maybe the author keeps that $30, so the total rental cost for each would be adjusted. However, if the apartment's rent is fixed and split equally, then allowing Y to switch without adjusting the splits properly could be an issue. The problem is that the author made a private agreement with Y, changing the arrangement without considering X's input, which might be unfair to X. X is upset because he's paying the same as the author but the author is getting a different room and lower rent.\n\nAnother angle: When they initially decided on the random draw, was there any agreement that if someone wanted to switch later, the others would be informed? If the author allowed Y to switch without consulting X, that could be the issue. X wasn't part of the negotiation, so he feels his share is being affected without his consent. The author might have thought it was a private matter between them and Y, but in reality, changing the room assignments and payment arrangements affects all roommates, especially if the rent is divided equally. \n\nThe author's action of taking $30 from Y could be seen as creating an unequal split without the knowledge of X, which could lead to unfairness. If the total rent is fixed, and the author is effectively keeping $30 from Y's share, that might mean X isn't getting a fair split. Alternatively, if the apartment's rent is split equally regardless of room size, the author shouldn't be profiting from the room switch unless all parties agreed.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they changed the arrangement without considering X's position. Roommate agreements usually require all parties to be on board with any changes. The author handled it privately, leading to conflict. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
