Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is at fault for \"scamming\" their roommate. The situation is about three roommates splitting an apartment with three rooms. The big room is 40% bigger, and there was some negotiation about who gets it.\n\nFirst, the roommates initially talked about who would get the big room. The author wanted it, and so did Y. They considered random selection or a bidding system. Y didn't want a bidding system because the author has a higher income, so they went with a random.org roll, and the author won.\n\nThen, after three days, Y changed their mind and wanted the big room. The author agreed that Y could have it if Y paid $30 extra each month. Now, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and paying the same rent, while the author is effectively paying less by getting the big room, and now Y is in the big room but the author is getting $30 from Y. X feels the author is scamming them.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did something wrong. Let's break it down. \n\n1. **Initial Agreement**: The author and Y decided via random selection. The author won, so they had the right to the big room. That seems fair. But then Y came back and wanted to switch. The author was willing to trade the room for $30/month. Was that a fair transaction?\n\n2. **Roommate Agreement**: Roommate agreements often assume equal rent, but in reality, people sometimes adjust based on room sizes. However, in this case, the author is now taking $30 from Y, which affects X. If the original agreement was equal rent, then the author's arrangement with Y might be causing an imbalance. X isn't part of that deal, so he might feel he's being treated unfairly compared to Y.\n\n3. **Fairness**: The author didn't consult X about the $30 arrangement. If all three roommates were supposed to split the rent equally, then Y paying extra to the author might mean that the total rent isn't truly split equally. X might end up paying less than their fair share if the author keeps the $30. Alternatively, if the $30 is going into the rent, maybe it's being used to cover the larger room's cost. But if the author is keeping the $30 as personal gain, that could be seen as unfair.\n\n4. **Intentions**: The author's goal was to keep the big room but allow Y to have it for a price. However, without informing X or getting his agreement, this could be seen as exploiting the situation. X's argument is that the author is getting a better deal by being in the big room but paying less, which isn't fair.\n\n5. **Legal and Ethical Standards**: Legally, roommates can agree to different rent splits if all parties agree. However, in this case, Y agreed to pay the $30 to the author, not to the landlord. If the total rent paid to the landlord is split equally, but the author is getting an extra $30, then effectively, Y is paying more than his share, and X is paying less. That's a problem because the original agreement might have been based on equal rent. If the author is using the $30 as personal money instead of redistributing it or using it to adjust the total rent, that's unfair to X.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's arrangement with Y affects X's situation without his consent. Even if the author thought they were making a fair deal with Y, the impact on X makes the overall arrangement unfair. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider X's position or involve him in the agreement, leading to an unequal distribution of costs that X didn't agree to.\n"
