Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about roommates splitting an apartment with three bedrooms. The big room is 40% bigger. Initially, the author, X, and Y all moved in. The author wanted the big room, and so did Y. They decided to randomize it, and the author got it. Then a few days later, Y wanted it and offered to pay $30 extra each month for the author to give up the room. The author agreed. Now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is effectively paying less rent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. When they moved in, they decided to use a random number generator to assign the big room. That seems fair because both had equal chance. The author got it. Then Y came back and wanted it, leading to a negotiated swap where Y pays $30 more. That seems like a mutual agreement between the author and Y. But X wasn't part of that negotiation. \n\nSo the problem is whether the author should have involved X in the decision. Maybe X felt that since they all share the rent, any changes in room assignments affecting rent should be discussed with everyone. The author might have thought that since X didn't care about the big room initially, it's their deal. But X is now upset because the cost distribution is unequal among roommates.\n\nAnother angle: when they first assigned the big room, X said he didn't care. Maybe the original agreement was to split the rent equally, but by swapping rooms and adjusting the rent, the author is creating an unequal distribution. If the total rent is split equally, but the author is getting a smaller room and paying less, while Y is paying more for a bigger room, that might be unfair to X. Unless they all agreed to a different rent split based on room size. \n\nBut the original setup was that the big room was assigned via random, so perhaps the rent was split equally regardless. When Y offered to pay $30 extra to the author, that could be seen as a private agreement that affects the overall fairness of the rent split among all roommates. If the total rent is fixed, but the author is effectively getting a discount by taking the smaller room, then X is paying the same as the author but in a smaller room. That's where X's complaint comes from.\n\nSo, maybe the author should have involved X in the arrangement. If the room assignments and rent are supposed to be equitable for all, then any changes should be discussed with everyone. The author's private deal with Y creates an imbalance that affects X. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering X's interests and the overall fairness of the rent distribution among all three roommates. \n\nBut I need to check if the original agreement allowed for such a private arrangement. If the initial agreement was that the big room would be assigned randomly and then any changes are up to the people involved, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the expectation was that room assignments and rent splits should be agreed upon by all three, then the author is in the wrong for not getting X's consent. \n\nThe key point is whether X's rights or expectations were violated. X didn't care about the big room initially, but now he's upset because his room is the same size as Y's but he's paying the same as the author who is in a smaller room. So, maybe the author should have structured the swap in a way that all roommates agreed to, to maintain equal rent splits based on room size. Alternatively, if the total rent is divided equally, the author's deal with Y creates an imbalance. \n\nIn many roommate situations, it's customary that if someone pays more for a bigger room, others might also adjust their payments. But if the total rent is fixed, then the author can't really take money from Y unless the overall rent is being adjusted. That might complicate things. The author's $30 from Y could be seen as a side agreement, but it affects the fairness from X's perspective. \n\nSo, the author's actions led to X feeling cheated because the cost distribution isn't equal. By not involving X in the negotiation, the author might have breached the implicit agreement among all roommates. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering the impact on X and not getting everyone's input before making a deal that affects the group's financial arrangement.\n"
