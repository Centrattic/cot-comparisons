Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if someone is at fault for \"scamming\" their roommate by charging them $30 a month to switch rooms.\n\nFirst, let's break down the details. The apartment has three bedrooms, with one being 40% bigger. Initially, the two roommates, X and Y (and the author) agreed to decide who gets the big room via a random draw. The author won. But then Y wanted it and offered to pay $30 extra a month for it, which the author agreed to. X is now upset because he's paying the same as the author but the author is making money from Y.\n\nSo, the key points here are the initial agreement and the subsequent arrangement between the author and Y. When they first moved in, they used a random method to assign the big room. That seems fair. Then Y, after losing the draw, proposed a payment to switch. The author agreed, and Y accepted. \n\nNow, X is upset because he wasn't part of that negotiation. But was he supposed to be? The initial agreement was between the author and Y. X didn't express interest in the big room initially. The author and Y made a private arrangement. X's complaint is that he's paying more rent than the author, but that's because the author is accepting $30 from Y. However, X didn't want the big room, so he's in a similar-sized room as the author. The author is essentially allowing Y to pay for the bigger room, which is a common practice in shared housing when room sizes differ.\n\nIs the author scamming X? Probably not. The author isn't scamming; they're negotiating a private agreement with Y. X might feel it's unfair that the author is getting money, but unless there was a prior agreement that all room assignments require consensus from all roommates, the author isn't in the wrong here. The problem arises because X wasn't involved in the initial decision about room assignments and now feels left out. The author didn't violate any rules; they just adjusted the setup based on a mutual agreement with Y. \n\nHowever, maybe the author should have informed X about the arrangement to avoid future misunderstandings. But legally and ethically, unless there was a rule that all room assignments require group agreement, the author isn't at fault. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
