Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about roommates and the big room in an apartment. The author moved in with two others. Before moving in, they decided to use a random generator (random.org) to determine who gets the bigger room, which the author won. However, after a few days, one roommate (Y) asked to switch, and the author agreed if Y paid $30 extra each month. Now, the other roommate (X) is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less, thinking the author is scamming them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the initial decision. They used a fair method\u2014random.org\u2014to assign the big room. The author won, so it's their right to have it. Then, when Y wanted it, the author offered a trade: Y pays $30 extra to move in. That seems like a reasonable compromise because Y wanted the room and was willing to pay for it. However, X is upset because he didn't get a chance to bid or negotiate. \n\nIs the author wrong for not involving X in the decision? The initial agreement was between the author and Y. X wasn't part of that negotiation. The author didn't promise anything to X. But X is now upset that his roommate is paying less. But why would X be paying the same as the author? The rent split might be based on room size. If the big room is 40% bigger, maybe the rent is split unequally. But initially, they used a random method. Then, after the author gave up the room to Y, Y pays an extra $30. So X is in a smaller room and pays the same as the author, who is in a smaller room now but pays less. Wait, no. Wait, the author was in the big room and then gave it to Y in exchange for $30. So now Y is in the big room and pays $30 more. The author is in a smaller room but pays regular rent. X is also in a smaller room, paying regular rent. So X is upset that the author is paying less than Y? But why would the author be paying less? If the total rent is split into three parts, maybe with the big room having a higher share. But the initial method was random. Then, the author and Y made a private agreement. So maybe the problem is that the author and Y adjusted their rent without consulting X. If the original rent split was supposed to be equal among all three, then Y paying extra might be a problem. But if the initial split was based on room size, then Y paying more for a bigger room makes sense. The confusion might be in how the rent was split. The author didn't mention if the total rent was divided equally or by room size. If they split the total rent three ways equally, then Y's $30 to the author would be on top of their equal share, which might be unfair to X. Alternatively, if the rent was split based on room size, then Y paying more for the bigger room is fair. The problem is that the author and Y made a private arrangement without involving X, which might have disrupted the initial agreement. Since X was not part of the initial negotiation between the author and Y, but is now affected because the financial arrangement changed without his input. However, the author didn't promise anything to X. The initial decision was to use a random generator, which the author won. The author then allowed Y to take the room by paying extra. If X is upset because he thought the initial random method was the only way, then maybe the author made a different arrangement that X didn't agree to. But if the author and Y agreed mutually and didn't take anything from X, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, X is now paying the same as the author, but the author is getting $30 from Y. If the total rent is fixed, maybe Y is effectively paying more, which could be affecting X's share. But the problem is unclear on how the rent is structured. Assuming the total rent is fixed, if Y is paying $30 more, that could mean the author is getting that $30, which might not be part of the original agreement with X. If the original agreement was to split rent equally, then the author taking extra could be unfair. But if the rent was supposed to be split by room size, then Y paying more is fair. Since the author didn't mention the rent structure, it's a bit ambiguous. However, the key point is that the author and Y made a private arrangement without involving X, which might have been a mistake. The author didn't scam X, but maybe made a decision that affects the group dynamics without considering X's feelings. But since the author didn't lie or break any initial agreement, maybe they're not in the wrong. Alternatively, the author should have included all roommates in any rent adjustments. In the initial decision, they used a fair method, and then made a private deal. If X is upset because he feels the author is profiting from the room, but the author isn't really\u2014it's a private agreement between two parties. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
