Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for taking money from their roommate to switch rooms.\n\nFirst, the setup: three roommates, two smaller rooms and one bigger. The author and Y wanted the big room. Initially, they decided to flip a coin (using random.org), the author won. Then Y came back after three days and wanted the room, so the author agreed to give it if Y paid $30 monthly extra. Now X is upset because he thinks the author is scamming him by getting a financial advantage.\n\nSo, the main issue is fairness and communication. The author and Y resolved their dispute privately, but didn't involve X. The original agreement was a random draw, but then a mutual agreement between two roommates changed that. The problem is X feels left out and it's affecting the fairness in the shared rent.\n\nIn roommate situations, transparency is key. If the rent is being split equally, but one person is effectively paying more (Y's extra $30), that can create imbalance. The author didn't consult X about the arrangement, which might be why X feels wronged. Even though the author and Y made an agreement, it affects all three roommates' living conditions and costs. So, the author might be in the wrong for not including X in the discussion and creating a situation where two are sharing the big room's cost but only one benefits. The $30 is essentially a side deal that wasn't part of the original agreement with all parties. Therefore, X's anger is valid because the author didn't maintain equal treatment, leading to perceived unfairness. Answer A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
