Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about roommates agreeing on who gets the bigger room. Initially, there were three people: the author, X, and Y. They all moved into an apartment with three rooms, one bigger than the others.\n\nThe author asked Y and X who would take the big room. X didn't care, Y wanted it. The author also wanted it. They discussed options like random selection or higher bidder. Y didn't want a bidding war because of income differences, so they ended up rolling a random number generator. The author won and got the big room.\n\nThen, after three days, Y changed their mind. The author proposed that if Y paid $30 extra each month, the author would give up the big room. Y agreed. Now, X is upset because he thinks the author is scamming him by paying less rent for the same room.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the initial agreement. The big room was decided by chance, and then a later arrangement between the author and Y. The problem is that X wasn't part of that second deal. X might feel that the arrangement isn't fair because he's paying the same as Y but in a smaller room. But the author and Y made a private agreement. \n\nBut wait, does X have a right to be involved in that agreement? If the original agreement for the big room was decided by random.org, then that was the initial agreement. Then, changing it required consensus? Or could the author and Y negotiate between themselves?\n\nX's argument is that he's now paying more effectively because the author is getting a financial benefit. But the author isn't taking money from X; instead, Y is paying the author $30. So the author is getting $30 from Y, which might mean Y's share of the rent is adjusted. But X isn't part of that.\n\nWait, how does the rent split work here? Are they splitting the total rent equally? If the total rent is divided equally among three, but Y is paying the author $30, maybe the author's effective rent is less. But does X have a right to be part of that negotiation?\n\nX might feel that any arrangement regarding room assignments and rent should involve all roommates. If the author and Y made a private agreement without X's consent, X could argue that it's unfair. Because if the original agreement was that the big room was assigned via lottery, changing it without consulting everyone might have broken that initial agreement. So the author might have acted without considering that the initial agreement was supposed to be fair for all, and changing it unilaterally with just Y could be seen as self-serving.\n\nAlso, when the author agreed to give up the big room in exchange for $30 from Y, that could be seen as exploiting the situation for personal gain, especially if X wasn't part of the discussion. Even though the author and Y agreed, the fact that X is now paying the same as Y but in a smaller room might be the root of X's anger. The author's action might be seen as creating an uneven rent distribution without the consent of all roommates.\n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because the initial agreement was supposed to be fair, and changing it without involving all roommates could be considered unfair. The author should have discussed any changes with all parties involved, not just Y. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
