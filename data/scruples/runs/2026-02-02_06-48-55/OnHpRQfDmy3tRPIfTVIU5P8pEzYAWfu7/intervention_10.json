Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. The situation involves three roommates moving into an apartment with three bedrooms, one bigger than the others. The author, X, and Y are roommates.\n\nFirst, before moving in, the author and Y wanted the bigger room. They decided to use a random number generator, and the author won. Then, three days later, Y wanted the room and offered to pay $30 extra to the author each month so the author would give up the room. The author agreed, so now Y has the big room, and the author gets the $30. Now, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less rent. X thinks the author is scamming him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, when they moved in, they had to decide who gets the big room. The author and Y both wanted it. They used a fair method (random.org) to decide, which the author won. That seems legitimate. Then, after three days, Y approached the author and wanted to change the arrangement. The author agreed to a payment of $30/month to transfer the room. Y agreed, so they made a private agreement.\n\nNow, X is upset. The key points here are: Did the author have the right to transfer the room to Y after the initial random assignment? Also, was the payment arrangement transparent among all roommates?\n\nAt the beginning, when they were deciding on the big room, X didn't express a desire for it. The author and Y resolved it between themselves. The author then made a deal with Y, which might not have been discussed with X. X is now paying the same rent as the author, but the author gets $30 less because they received payment from Y. X feels this is unfair because he's not getting the same deal.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, when they first moved in, the big room was assigned via a fair method. Then, after three days, they made a private agreement. If all parties involved (author and Y) agreed to the terms, then perhaps it's their right to do so. However, the problem arises because X feels excluded and the payment affects the overall rent distribution.\n\nWait, but how is the rent divided? If the total rent is split among the three, and the author is receiving $30 from Y, does that mean the author is effectively paying less than their share? For example, if the total rent is $X, each should pay $X/3. But if the author is getting $30 from Y, then the author's net payment is less. So from X's perspective, he's paying $X/3, while the author is paying $X/3 - $30. That's unfair to X because he's not part of the deal. The author and Y are effectively creating an unequal payment system without including X. \n\nBut was there an initial agreement on how the big room's value would be accounted for? If the initial split was that everyone pays equal rent regardless of room size, then the author and Y's arrangement skews that. The problem is that by accepting $30 from Y, the author is effectively reducing their own rent, which isn't fair to X who is paying the same as before. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the big room is worth more, maybe the rent should be split based on room size. But if they had agreed to equal splits, then the author and Y's deal bypasses that agreement. However, the author didn't consult X when making the deal, so X feels wronged. \n\nAnother angle: The author might argue that it's their right to sublet the room or get a payment for it. But in a shared apartment, usually, all roommates need to agree on room assignments and rent splits. If the initial agreement was equal rent, then the author and Y's deal changes that without X's consent. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not involving X in the decision-making process. The initial assignment was fair, but the subsequent agreement between Y and the author altered the original arrangement without considering X's input. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't include X in the process, leading to an unfair situation for him.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n"
