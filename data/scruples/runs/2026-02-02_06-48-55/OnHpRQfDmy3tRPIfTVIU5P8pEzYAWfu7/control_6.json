Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about roommates agreeing on who gets the bigger room. Initially, there's a dispute between the author and Y. The author and Y decide to flip a coin (using a random number generator) and the author wins the bigger room. Then, Y comes back three days later and offers to pay $30 more per month for the bigger room, and the author agrees to let Y take the room in exchange for Y covering the extra $30. Now, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is effectively paying $30 less per month compared to X.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the original agreement. The author and Y resolved the initial conflict through a random method, which seems fair. Then, when Y approached the author again, the author agreed to a new arrangement where Y pays the $30 to the author. But maybe the problem here is that the author didn't involve X in the decision. Since all three roommates are sharing the apartment, maybe the initial agreement should have included all of them. The author made a deal with Y without considering X's input, which might be why X feels wronged.\n\nAlso, when the author says \"you can have the room instead of me\" in exchange for $30, perhaps there's an assumption that the rent is split equally among the three. If the total rent is split three ways, then by having Y pay the author $30, the author is effectively getting a $30 discount from Y. That could be seen as unfair to X, who is paying the same amount but not benefiting from the arrangement. X might feel that the rent should be adjusted collectively, not just between two roommates.\n\nAnother angle is that the initial decision to use a random generator was between the author and Y, but maybe X should have been included in that process as well. Since all three roommates are part of the living arrangement, perhaps the author should have discussed the room allocation with X from the start. By making a deal with Y, the author might have left X out of the loop, leading to the current conflict.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that since X initially said he didn't care, there was no need to involve him. But maybe X's indifference was only about the initial allocation, not about the financial aspect. Once the author started receiving money from Y, that could affect the rent split, which X wasn't part of. So the issue is that the author changed the agreement in a way that impacted X without his consent.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the total rent is split equally, then the author is paying less than X and Y. That could be unfair to X because he's paying the same amount as Y but Y is effectively paying more to get a bigger room. The author's arrangement with Y might be a private agreement, but in a three-people setup, such agreements can affect the third party. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not considering X's position in the arrangement.\n\nSo, the key points are: the initial allocation decision didn't include X, the subsequent financial arrangement between the author and Y affects X's financial burden, and X wasn't involved in either step. This could make the author wrong because they made decisions that impact X without his input, leading to an imbalanced situation.\n"
