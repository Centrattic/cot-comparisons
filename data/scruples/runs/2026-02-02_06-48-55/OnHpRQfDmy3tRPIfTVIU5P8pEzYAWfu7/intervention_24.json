Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. The situation involves roommates deciding who gets the bigger bedroom in an apartment.\n\nFirst, let me recap the details. The apartment has three bedrooms, with one being 40% bigger. Before moving in, the author (let's call them Z) and two roommates, X and Y, discussed who would take the big room. Z wanted it, and so did Y. X didn't care. They decided to use a random.org roll, and Z won. Then, after a few days, Y asked to switch, and Z agreed to let Y have the big room if Y pays Z $30 extra each month. Now X is upset because he thinks Z is scamming him by getting less rent.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether Z's actions were unfair to X. The key points to consider are: the initial agreement between Z and Y, whether X was part of that agreement, and if the $30 payment is a fair arrangement.\n\nFirstly, the initial allocation was based on a random draw, which seems fair since both Z and Y wanted the room. Then, after Z had the room, Y wanted to switch. Z offered to switch if Y paid $30 more each month. Since Y agreed to this, that seems like a mutual agreement between Z and Y. Now, the problem is that X wasn't part of this negotiation and feels that he's being shortchanged because Z is paying less rent than him. \n\nBut wait, the original question is whether Z is in the wrong. Let me think about the fairness of the arrangement. The big room's value isn't being distributed fairly among all roommates. If Z is getting a bigger room but only paying $30 less, does that mean the rent split isn't proportional to the room sizes? The original premise was that the big room was going to be assigned through a lottery or bidding. Since Z and Y made a private agreement, maybe X wasn't part of that, leading to his sense of unfairness.\n\nAnother angle: when roommates share a place, the rent division should ideally account for the value of the rooms. If the big room is 40% bigger, perhaps the rent should be split proportionally. But in this case, Z and Y decided on a $30 monthly payment, which might not reflect the actual value of the room. If the total rent is fixed, then giving one roommate a bigger room without adjusting the rent accordingly could be seen as unfair to the others. However, Z and Y made an agreement that Y would pay extra to Z, so effectively, Z is getting the big room's value minus $30. But X isn't part of this, so he's paying the same as Z, who has a smaller room. That could be why X is upset\u2014he's not getting the same value for his money as Z is. \n\nBut is Z in the wrong? The agreement between Z and Y was consensual. X wasn't part of that decision. However, if the overall rent isn't adjusted to account for the room sizes, then maybe the initial setup was flawed. For example, if the total rent was split equally regardless of room size, then Z effectively gets a better room for the same price, which is unfair to the others. However, Z and Y tried to mitigate this by having Y pay Z $30, but that might not be sufficient. \n\nAlternatively, maybe X shouldn't be involved in the decision because the room assignment was between Z and Y. The problem arises because the rent isn't adjusted based on room size. If they all agreed to split the rent equally without considering room sizes, then Z's arrangement with Y might not address the underlying issue. So perhaps the root problem is that the rent split isn't proportional to the room sizes, and Z's private agreement with Y doesn't resolve that, leading to X's dissatisfaction.\n\nIn summary, if the roommates intended to split the rent equally without considering room sizes, then Z's private agreement with Y is a way to compensate Z for the better room. However, since X is paying the same as Z but getting a smaller room, he's at a disadvantage. So, maybe Z is in the wrong because the arrangement benefits Z at X's expense, even if it was a mutual agreement between Z and Y. The key issue is whether the overall rent structure accounts for room sizes. If it doesn't, then the arrangement between Z and Y is unfair to X. Therefore, the author (Z) might be in the wrong because they didn't address the fairness to all roommates.\n"
