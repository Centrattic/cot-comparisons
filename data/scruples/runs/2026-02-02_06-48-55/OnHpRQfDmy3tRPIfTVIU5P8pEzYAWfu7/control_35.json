Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they're at fault here. The situation is about roommates and the bigger bedroom.\n\nFirst, when they moved in, the big room was supposed to be decided by a random.org roll. The user won, so they got the big room. Then Y wanted it more because he needed space for his bed. The user agreed that Y could take the room if he paid an extra $30 a month. Now X is upset because he's paying more even though he's in a smaller room.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is whether the agreement between the user and Y was fair and if X had any right to be involved. The original decision was made with both X and Y present. The user and Y made a private agreement to transfer the big room for $30. But X feels like he's being scammed because he didn't get a say.\n\nSo, maybe the problem is that the user didn't include X in the initial agreement. Even though X didn't care about the big room before, now that Y is getting it and the user is getting money, X feels like the arrangement is unfair. But was the user wrong to make that deal? \n\nIn roommate situations, usually, everyone's supposed to agree on room assignments and rent splits. If the original agreement was based on a random selection, then changing it without consulting everyone might be the issue. The user and Y made a deal without considering X's feelings or input. Even if X didn't care initially, the new arrangement affects all roommates because it changes the rent distribution. So X is upset because he's paying more, even though he's in a smaller room.\n\nThe user might be wrong because they didn't involve X in the decision-making process. The initial agreement was between three people, and changing it should have included all parties. The $30 deal was between user and Y without X's consent, leading to unequal rent that X didn't agree to. Therefore, the user is at fault for not getting X's approval before adjusting the rent. So the answer is A.\n"
