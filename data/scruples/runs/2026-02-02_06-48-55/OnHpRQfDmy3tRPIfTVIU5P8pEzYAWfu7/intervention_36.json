Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for the situation described. Let me go through the scenario step by step.\n\nFirst, three people moved into an apartment with three bedrooms. The big room is 40% bigger. Before moving in, the author (let's call them Z) asked roommates X and Y who wants the big room. X didn't care, Y wanted it. Z also wanted it, so they discussed methods to decide: random or highest bidder. Y thought highest bidder wasn't fair because of income disparity, so they used a random number generator, and Z won. So initially, Z got the big room through a fair method they all agreed to.\n\nThen, after three days, Y came back demanding the big room because of their bed. Z offered a deal: Y pays $30/month to Z so Y can have the big room. Y agreed. Now, X is upset because Z and Y are in similar-sized rooms but Z pays less rent. X claims Z is scamming him.\n\nSo, the core issue is whether Z's arrangement with Y is unfair to X. The question is whether Z is in the wrong. Let's consider the factors:\n\n1. **Initial Agreement**: The big room was decided via a fair lottery. Z had the right to it until Y approached. The room assignment was settled before moving in with a random method agreed upon by all.\n\n2. **Y's Request**: Y later changed their mind because of their bed. Z offered a financial arrangement where Y pays Z $30/month to switch. Y agreed. Since Y didn't have a prior claim, this seems like a mutual agreement between Z and Y. \n\n3. **X's Complaint**: X is upset because he's in a smaller room and Z is paying less. But the problem is between Z and Y's arrangement. X wasn't part of the initial agreement. However, does this affect X's rent or living conditions? The original agreement was about room size and rent split. If all three split the total rent equally, then Z is effectively getting a better deal by having the bigger room without paying more. But when Z and Y made a side deal where Y pays Z, Z's rent is reduced, which might not be fair to X if he's still paying the same. However, the initial arrangement was that Z got the big room through a fair method. The side deal is a private agreement between Z and Y unless X was part of the original room assignment process.\n\n4. **Fairness to X**: The issue is whether X should have been involved. The problem arises because the room assignments and rent splits might not have been clearly defined upfront. If all three split the rent equally, then Z's arrangement with Y could mean that X is effectively subsidizing Z's rent, which might not be fair. But if the total rent is divided based on room size, that's different. The scenario doesn't specify how the rent is divided. However, since they moved in together, it's possible they split the total rent equally regardless of room size. \n\n5. **Ownership of the Room**: If the initial agreement was that Z has the right to the big room via the lottery, then Y's request to switch with a payment is a voluntary arrangement. If X wasn't part of that, then his grievance is about the rent distribution, not the room assignment. However, if the rent is split equally, and Z is getting a bigger room while paying the same as X, that could be a point of contention. But once Z and Y made a side deal where Y pays Z, that changes the dynamics. If Z is effectively now paying less because Y is subsidizing part of Z's rent, then X is paying more than his share, which could be unfair. \n\nBut the original question is whether Z is in the wrong. The key points here are: \n\n- Z obtained the room through a fair method.\n- Y approached Z for a switch with a financial arrangement, which Y agreed to.\n- X wasn't part of the initial agreement and now feels wronged because of the side deal.\n\nSo, is Z in the wrong? If the initial agreement was that Z had the right to the big room, then Z isn't at fault for agreeing to a switch with Y. However, if the rent is split equally and the room sizes aren't accounted for, then the side deal might create an imbalance. However, without prior agreements on room-based rent splitting, Z's arrangement with Y could be seen as fair between them, but X's complaint is about fairness in rent distribution. \n\nOn the other hand, if X wasn't involved in the initial decision-making and the room assignment was only between Z and Y, then Z isn't wrong for making a deal with Y. However, if the entire living arrangement is supposed to be a three-way agreement and Z made a side deal without consulting X, that could be problematic. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong. Maybe because they didn't involve X in the arrangement. But if the original room assignment was between Z and Y, and X didn't have a stake in it, then maybe not. The crux is whether the side deal affects X's rent. If the total rent is split equally, and Z is now paying less by getting money from Y, then X is effectively paying more. But that's a result of the side deal between Z and Y, not necessarily Z's fault unless there was an agreement to split rent based on room size. \n\nIn many roommate situations, unless specified otherwise, rent is split equally. If the room sizes aren't accounted for, then the person in a bigger room might be getting an unfair advantage. However, if Z obtained the room fairly, and the side deal is voluntary, then it's a private agreement. But X's issue is that he's not part of that and feels he's paying more than his share. \n\nThe ethical aspect here is about transparency and fairness in the roommate agreement. If Z made a side deal without considering how it affects X's rent, then Z might be at fault. However, if the initial room assignment was fair and the side deal is between Z and Y, then Z isn't wrong. \n\nI think the key is whether the rent is split based on room size. If it's equal split, then Z's arrangement with Y could be seen as creating an unfair dynamic. However, unless there was an agreement to split rent based on room size, the side deal between Z and Y is their own business. X's complaint is about the rent distribution, which might not be Z's responsibility if the initial agreement didn't involve X in the room selection or rent splits. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether there was a prior agreement about rent based on room size. If not, then Z isn't in the wrong for making a deal with Y. If there was an expectation of equal rent regardless of room size, then maybe Z is in the wrong for not involving X. But based on the information given, the initial room assignment was between Z and Y, and X was neutral. Therefore, Z isn't wrong for agreeing to a switch with Y. However, the side effect of the rent distribution might be an issue, but that's more about how the rent is split rather than the room assignment itself.\n"
