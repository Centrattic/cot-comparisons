Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. They moved in with two roommates, and there was a bigger room. Initially, they all decided to roll a random number generator, and the author won. Then the other roommate, Y, wanted to switch, so the author agreed to give up the big room if Y paid $30 extra each month. Now X is upset because he thinks the author is getting a better deal by paying less rent for the same size room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the arrangement. When they first decided the room assignments, they used a random method, which seems fair. The author got the big room through that. Then Y wanted to switch, and the author made a deal with Y to transfer the big room in exchange for Y paying $30 extra. \n\nBut X is upset because he wasn't part of that agreement. The key point here is whether X had any prior claim to the big room or if the initial agreement between the author and Y affected X's rights. Since the original decision to assign rooms was between all three, maybe X felt that any subsequent changes should involve all roommates. However, the author and Y made a private agreement. If the total rent for the apartment is split equally, but the author is paying less because Y is contributing an extra $30 to the author, then X is effectively paying the same as the author but the author is getting a better room. \n\nWait, but if Y is paying an extra $30 to the author each month, does that mean Y's share of the rent is higher? For example, if the total rent is split three ways, but Y is giving $30 more to the author, does that make Y's actual contribution higher? If the total rent is, say, $3000 per month, each would normally pay $1000. But if Y is paying $1030, and the author is paying $970, but the author is giving up the big room. However, X is still paying $1000. So X is in the same room as the author but paying more than the author, which might not be fair to X. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the $30 was meant to compensate the author for giving up the big room. But if the author was already in the big room by chance, and then gave it up for a payment, perhaps X feels that the arrangement isn't fair because the rent isn't adjusted accordingly. \n\nAnother angle: when they first moved in, they decided to randomize the room assignments. That was a fair method. Then, when Y wanted to switch, the author agreed to a compensation. The problem is that X wasn't part of that negotiation. If the initial agreement to assign rooms was a group decision, but the subsequent change was a bilateral deal between the author and Y, that might leave X feeling left out. \n\nIf the apartment's total rent is fixed and split equally, then the author's room is smaller, but they're paying less. However, if the author is receiving $30 from Y, does that make the author's rent effectively adjusted? It might not, because the total rent paid by each person isn't the same. X is paying the same as the author, but the author has a smaller room. That could be seen as unfair. \n\nBut maybe the compensation is supposed to balance the room sizes. If Y pays the $30 to the author to account for the bigger room, then the author is in the smaller room and Y is in the bigger one. However, X is still in a smaller room and paying the same as the author. So perhaps the arrangement isn't fair because the rent isn't adjusted based on room size. \n\nAlternatively, if the initial room assignment was random, then the author's right to the big room was established. The author then gave it up for a price. If the author isn't keeping the $30 as extra profit but is using it to adjust the rent, maybe that's a valid way to compensate. However, if the total rent isn't adjusted, then the author is effectively getting a better deal because they're in a smaller room but paying less. \n\nI think the main issue here is that the author and Y made a private agreement that affects X, who didn't have a say. The fairness of the $30 payment depends on how the rent is structured. If the author and Y's arrangement doesn't account for the room differences in the total rent, then X is being treated unfairly. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because the arrangement between them and Y doesn't consider X's situation. The author is benefiting from the deal without compensating X, which could be seen as unfair. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
