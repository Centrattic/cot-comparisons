Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about roommates and the bigger bedroom. The author moved in with two others, and they had to decide who gets the biggest room. Initially, the author and Y wanted it. Y didn't want to bid because the author might have higher income. They flipped a coin (using a random generator) and the author won.\n\nThen, after a few days, Y came back and wanted the big room, maybe because his bed didn't fit. The author agreed to let Y have it if Y pays $30 extra each month. Now, X is upset because he thinks the author is getting a better deal by paying less rent for the same room.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the original agreement was fair. The author and Y decided to randomize it, which seems fair since both wanted it. Then later, Y wanted to trade, and they came up with a $30 payment. But X was not part of this negotiation. The problem is that X feels left out and thinks the author is scamming him by getting a discount. \n\nIs the author obligated to include X in the arrangement? If the initial decision was between the author and Y, then maybe X wasn't part of the negotiation. However, since all three are roommates, maybe the original rent split wasn't adjusted properly. The author is now paying less than X because they gave up the big room. If the rent is supposed to be split equally, then by giving Y $30, the author is effectively paying less than the others. \n\nBut the author and Y made an agreement. If the total rent is split equally among all three, then the $30 from Y would go to the author, making the author effectively pay $30 less per month. That could be seen as unfair to X because he's not getting any compensation. However, the author might argue that the room size affects the rent they're paying. But since the original agreement was about who gets the room, maybe the author isn't supposed to redistribute benefits from the room size. \n\nAlso, the author's decision to let Y have the room for $30 could be seen as a private agreement. But since the room allocation affects the overall rent distribution among all roommates, perhaps X should have been included in the discussion. The author didn't consider that their arrangement with Y would create an imbalance in what each roommate pays. \n\nSo, the key points are: The initial random selection was fair. The author then made a deal with Y without consulting X. The result is that X ends up paying more because the author is effectively receiving money from Y, which might not be properly accounted for in the overall rent split. \n\nIn roommate situations, it's common for rent to be split equally unless there's a specific agreement. If the bigger room is worth more, maybe the rent should be adjusted accordingly. However, the author and Y's deal might not have considered the broader implications on X's rent. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't include X in the negotiation, leading to an unfair distribution of rent from X's perspective. The author's private arrangement created a situation where X pays more without his consent. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
