Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about roommates disagreeing over who should get the bigger room and how to split the rent.\n\nFirst, when they moved in, the author and roommate Y wanted the bigger room. The author suggested a random draw, and the author won. But then Y asked again after a few days, and the author agreed to let Y have the room if Y paid an extra $30 each month. Now, roommate X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less rent.\n\nThe key points here are fairness in roommate agreements and whether everyone was informed and agreed to the terms. The original agreement between the author and Y was based on a random draw, which seems fair. However, when Y wanted to switch, the author made a new arrangement without involving X. The problem arises because X wasn't part of that negotiation. \n\nRoommate agreements, especially when it comes to splitting rent unevenly, usually require all parties to agree. If the author and Y made a side deal that affects X's share of the rent without his consent, that's where the issue is. Even if X isn't directly involved in the extra $30, if the total rent is split three ways and the author is paying less because of the deal, it might mean X is effectively paying more. But the story isn't entirely clear on that. \n\nHowever, the main issue is the fairness in communication. X feels wronged because the author didn't consult him. Even if the initial arrangement was fair, changing it without including all roommates can lead to resentment. The author's action might have been a good-faith effort to accommodate Y, but not involving X in the discussion about the rent split is a problem. \n\nIn roommate situations, all parties should be on the same page regarding how rent is divided, especially when it affects the financial balance. The author might have thought it was a private agreement between them and Y, but since X is also a roommate, his feelings and agreement are important. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily scamming, but they might have mishandled the communication. The answer could lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't get X's consent for the new arrangement, even if the initial agreement was fair. The problem is the lack of transparency and inclusion of all roommates in the financial decisions affecting everyone.\n"
