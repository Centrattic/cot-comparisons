Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is wrong for taking money from their roommate to switch rooms.\n\nFirst, the setup: three people moving into an apartment with three rooms\u2014two small and one big. The big room is 40% bigger. The author, Y, and X (roommate X) are the roommates. Initially, there was a conflict over the big room. The author and Y both wanted it. Y said it's unfair if it's given to the highest bidder because of income differences. They decided to flip a coin (using random.org) and the author won. Then, after three days, Y approached the author and offered to pay $30/month to swap rooms. The author agreed. Now, roommate X is upset because he feels the author is scamming him by getting a cheaper rent.\n\nThe key points here are: the initial agreement was a coin flip, which was agreed upon by all. Then, a voluntary agreement between the author and Y to swap rooms for $30/month. X is now upset because the author isn't sharing that money with him. \n\nThe legal aspect: If the room assignment was decided by a coin flip and then later a mutual agreement between two roommates, then the original agreement might not be binding unless all parties were part of the negotiation. However, in most roommate situations, unless there's a formal lease agreement specifying room assignments and rent sharing, it's often considered a verbal agreement among tenants. \n\nMoral/ethical considerations: The author and Y agreed to the swap. The problem arises when X feels left out. The initial division was done without X's input, but after the coin flip, X wasn't part of the subsequent swap. If the lease is split three ways, and the author is getting a cheaper rent, X might feel he's paying more. However, if the author and Y made a private agreement without changing the overall rent amount, maybe the total rent paid by all three remains the same. Wait, the author says that Y would pay $30/month to the author. So the total rent for all three would be the same as before? Because the author is getting $30 less, but Y is paying the same total. Wait, maybe the author is getting $30 less from their own rent, and Y is paying that $30 to the author. That way, the author's effective rent is reduced, and Y's is effectively increased. But X's remains the same. So X ends up paying the same as before, but he's now in a smaller room. Wait, but the rooms are assigned as per the original coin flip. X's room size hasn't changed. Unless the swap between the author and Y affects X's room? No, the rooms are fixed. So X is in his original room. The author and Y swapped. \n\nBut the problem is that the author is getting $30 less in rent by giving up the big room to Y. X's rent remains the same. So if the total rent is shared equally, then each pays the same amount. But if the author is getting $30 less from their own rent, then the total rent paid by all three would be less? Or is the total rent fixed, and the author is just receiving money from Y? \n\nWait, maybe the original setup is that each roommate pays their share of the total rent. Let's say the total rent is R. So each was paying R/3. Then, after the swap, the author is paying (R/3 - $30), and Y is paying (R/3 + $30). X still pays R/3. So overall, the total rent remains R. But X is now paying his share, and the author and Y have adjusted their own payments. The problem is that X is upset because he's paying the same but the author is getting a lower rent. \n\nBut if X's room size is the same as before, then maybe his rent should be the same. However, if the original agreement was that the big room is assigned via coin flip, then the author's room assignment is fixed unless they agree to change it. \n\nThe author's agreement with Y is a private arrangement. If X wasn't part of that agreement, then he might feel wronged. But if the author and Y made the swap without involving X, but the total rent remains the same, then X's payment isn't affected. However, the author's rent is now lower, which might be seen as unfair because X is paying the same for a smaller room. \n\nBut if the rooms were assigned via a fair method (coin flip), and then the author and Y negotiated a swap among themselves, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the overall system of room assignments and rent isn't set up to account for such swaps, maybe the author should have involved X in the decision, especially if the rental agreement requires consent from all parties. \n\nIn many roommate situations, all tenants are jointly and severally liable for rent. So even if the author and Y make a private agreement, the landlord might still expect each to pay their share. However, if they are splitting the rent themselves, then the author receiving money from Y is a personal arrangement. \n\nThe main issue is whether X was part of the initial room assignment and if the subsequent swap was communicated to him. The author might not be in the wrong because they followed through with the initial agreement and then made a private deal with Y. However, X's anger might stem from feeling that the author is getting an unfair advantage without considering him. \n\nBut if the swap doesn't affect X's room or his rent, then X's complaint might be about the fact that the author is getting a better deal. However, if the author and Y agreed to the swap, and X wasn't involved, then the author might be in the right. On the other hand, if the original room assignment was supposed to be fair (coin flip), but then the author changed it for money, that might be seen as exploiting the situation. \n\nAnother angle: The author initially gave up the right to the big room via the coin flip but then accepted money to give it up. That could be seen as unfair if the coin flip was supposed to be the final decision. But the author and Y agreed to a swap, which the author might see as a fair trade. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if the author is getting $30/month for giving up the big room to Y, and Y is willing to pay for it, it's a mutual agreement. However, X's problem is that he feels the author is benefiting at his expense. But unless X's rent is affected, maybe his complaint is unjustified. \n\nWait, maybe X's rent isn't affected. If the total rent is fixed, and the author is just getting money from Y, then X's share remains the same. So X is paying the same amount for his original room. The author's room is smaller, so their rent should be lower, but they were already paying the same as everyone else. By getting $30 from Y, the author's effective rent is lower, which could be seen as unfair to X. \n\nBut if the rooms were assigned via a fair method, and then the author and Y made a private arrangement, it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the author and Y didn't inform X of the swap, or if the original agreement was that the coin flip was final, then maybe the author is in the wrong for not sticking to the original decision. \n\nAlternatively, the author might have the right to choose their room, even if it means getting money from Y to switch. But if the original agreement was that the coin flip decided it, then the author might be violating that by accepting money to change it. \n\nI think the key here is whether the original agreement was binding. If the coin flip was agreed upon by all, then changing the room after the fact for money could be seen as going back on the agreement. But if Y later wanted to change it and the author agreed, then it's a new agreement between two parties. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the right if the swap was mutual and didn't affect X's rent. However, X's anger could be justified if the original coin flip was supposed to be the final decision. The answer depends on whether the author's agreement with Y adhered to the initial terms or if it's a new arrangement. Since the author and Y agreed after the coin flip, and the author is now receiving money from Y, it's a new arrangement. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
