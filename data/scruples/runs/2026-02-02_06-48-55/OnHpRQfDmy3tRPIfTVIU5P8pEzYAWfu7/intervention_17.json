Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for their actions regarding apartment room assignments and rent splitting.\n\nFirst, when they moved in, they used a random generator to decide who gets the bigger room. The author won, so initially, they were in the bigger room. Then Y wanted it and the author agreed to let Y have it if Y paid $30 extra each month. Now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less rent. \n\nThe main issue seems to be fairness in how the rent is divided. The key points here are the initial agreement and whether the $30 per month arrangement was communicated to everyone. If the original agreement was that the big room was assigned randomly, but then the author entered a separate agreement with Y without telling X, that could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the problem is that X feels he's paying more because the author is getting a discount. The total rent was split among three people. If the author is effectively paying $30 less, then X and Y might be covering that difference. But the arrangement between the author and Y might not have been fair to X. \n\nAnother angle: when Y wanted the big room, the author made a deal. But if X didn't agree to that deal, then the deal is only between the author and Y. However, if the deal affects X's share of the rent (i.e., the total rent is split equally, but the author is getting a discount), then X is being indirectly affected. \n\nIf the total rent is split equally, then each person pays a third. If the author is getting $30 less from Y, that might mean Y is paying more than a third, which could be why X is upset. But if the deal is that Y is paying an extra $30 to the author, not to the landlord, then the landlord's total remains the same. \n\nWait, maybe the arrangement is that Y is paying the author $30 per month to live in the bigger room. So the author is getting $30 more from Y, which the author might be keeping, thus effectively lowering their own share. But if the total rent is split equally, then the author's total payment to the landlord is the same, but they're getting money from Y. That would mean the author is making money from the deal, which could be seen as unfair to X. \n\nBut if the total rent is fixed, and each roommate splits it equally, then the author isn't necessarily paying less. The author is still paying their own share. The author is getting money from Y, which is separate from the rent. So maybe the issue is that the author is profiting from the room arrangement, which X is upset about. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the deal was that Y would pay an extra $30 to the landlord to cover the author's share, but that's not what was stated. The problem is the lack of communication with X. If X wasn't part of the agreement, but the agreement affects the rent split, then the author might be in the wrong. \n\nIn roommate situations, it's important that all parties agree on the terms. Even if the author and Y made a private deal, if X wasn't informed or didn't agree, X has a right to be upset. The author didn't include X in the decision, which could be seen as unfair. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they made a deal without consulting all roommates, leading to an unequal distribution of responsibility or costs, which is a common issue in roommate agreements.\n"
