Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for setting up a deal with roommate Y to pay $30 a month so Y could have the bigger room. The other roommate, X, is upset because he feels the author is getting preferential treatment by paying less.\n\nFirst, the initial decision: the author and Y decided to flip a coin for the big room. The author won. Then, Y wanted to switch, so the author asked for $30/month from Y to give up the room. Y agreed. Now X is mad because he didn't get to be part of that negotiation and feels the author is exploiting the situation.\n\nThe key points here are consent and fairness. When they first moved in, X didn't express any interest in the big room, so maybe he's now claiming he should have been considered. But the author and Y made a mutual agreement. X wasn't part of that, so maybe he feels left out. But the author didn't force anything on X. The problem is that X is upset because he's paying the same rent as the author but the author is getting a discount for giving up the big room. But X didn't want the big room initially, so maybe he's now realizing he should have participated in the bidding or coin flip.\n\nLegally, unless there's a lease agreement that specifies room assignments and rent split, roommates can make their own arrangements. The author and Y made a private agreement. However, X might feel that the arrangement affects him because the rent is split three ways, and the $30 is essentially coming from Y's portion. If X is paying the same as the author but the author is getting a discount, that could be seen as unfair, especially if X didn't agree to the terms. \n\nBut since X didn't participate in the initial allocation of the room, maybe the author isn't wrong. The issue is that X is now upset because he wasn't part of the decision. The author might be in the wrong if the deal affects the rent split among all roommates without their consent. However, if the $30 is just an extra payment from Y to the author, not affecting the overall rent split, then maybe it's okay. But if the total rent is split three ways and Y is paying more in total, that could be an issue. The question is whether the author is allowed to accept money from Y to switch rooms, which could be a valid arrangement as long as it's agreed upon by both parties involved. X's problem is that he wasn't part of the deal, but the author didn't force anything on him. However, the author might be in the wrong if the arrangement affects the fairness of the overall rent distribution without X's knowledge or agreement. But if the total rent remains the same and the $30 is just a side agreement, then it's between the author and Y. The answer depends on the specific terms of their lease and how the rent is structured. But in the absence of a lease agreement, roommates can make their own deals, so the author might not be in the wrong. However, X's frustration is understandable because he wasn't part of the negotiation. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not including X in the discussion, even if the deal is between Y and the author. It's possible that the author should have discussed any changes in room assignments with all roommates to maintain fairness and transparency.\n"
