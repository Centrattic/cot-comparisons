Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for charging a roommate an extra $30 a month to swap rooms after a random selection. \n\nFirst, the setup: three roommates, three rooms, one bigger. Initially, they decided to flip a coin, and the user won the big room. Then, after a few days, the other roommate (Y) wanted the big room and offered to pay the user $30 a month to take their smaller room. The user agreed. Now, the third roommate (X) is upset because he's in a smaller room and the user is paying $30 less, arguing that the user is scamming everyone.\n\nSo, the key points here. When they first decided on the random selection, both Y and the user were in agreement. The coin flip was fair, and the user got the big room. Then, Y wanted to make a deal. The user offered a trade: Y pays $30/month to have the bigger room. That seems like a personal agreement between Y and the user. But X is now upset because he wasn't part of that negotiation. \n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. The main issue is whether the user should have involved X in the arrangement. If the initial agreement was between the user and Y, and X wasn't part of that deal, then maybe X has a point. But the user didn't take money from X; they just adjusted their rent with Y. \n\nHowever, if the total rent for the apartment is split equally among all three roommates, then when Y pays $30 to the user, effectively the user is getting $30 less than the others. If the apartment's rent is divided equally, and the user is receiving extra from Y, then the user's share is lower, which might not be fair to X. X is paying the same as before but isn't getting any benefit from the arrangement. \n\nBut from the user's perspective, the deal was between them and Y. If the original agreement was for each to pay their own share, and the user is just getting compensated by Y for the room swap, that's a private agreement. However, if the initial rent split was meant to be equal, then the user's receiving $30 from Y could be seen as creating an unequal payment structure without X's consent. \n\nBut maybe the total rent isn't being divided equally. If Y is paying the user $30, perhaps the total amount each pays is adjusted. For example, if the user's original share was $X, and Y is now paying $X + $30 to the user, then the user is effectively getting $30 more than the others. Wait, no\u2014if the user is giving up the big room to Y for $30/month, then the user is receiving $30 from Y. So the user's total rent would be their original share minus $30, while Y's total is original plus $30. X is paying the same. So the user is getting $30 less rent, and Y is paying $30 more. X is in the same spot as before. \n\nBut if the initial rent split was based on equal shares, then maybe the user is now receiving a discount on their rent due to the room swap, which isn't fair to X. However, the user didn't make a deal with X. The user and Y made a private agreement. If the apartment's total rent is split equally, and the user is getting $30 from Y, that could be seen as the user effectively paying $30 less than the others. But maybe the original rent split wasn't per room but per person. If the apartment's total rent is split equally among the three, then each person pays 1/3. If the user received $30 from Y, then their net payment is 1/3 - $30, which is less than others. That would be unfair to X, who is paying 1/3. So X is upset because he's paying the same as the user but the user is getting a discount. \n\nBut the user's argument is that they gave up the big room to Y in exchange for $30. So the user is being compensated for the room swap. However, if the initial agreement was to split the rent equally regardless of room size, then this arrangement might not be fair. Alternatively, if the rent was split based on room size, but the user accepted a lower rent by swapping with Y, that's a different story. \n\nThe key here is whether the original agreement was to split rent equally regardless of room size or if it was to have different shares based on room size. If it was the former, then the user's arrangement with Y could be seen as unfair to X. If the rent was supposed to be equal regardless of room, then the user is getting a benefit (better room) without paying more, and then allowing Y to pay for it, which could be seen as exploiting the situation. \n\nBut the user didn't explicitly agree on rent based on room size. The initial selection was random, and then a private deal was made. X wasn't part of that. So X's complaint is that he's not getting any benefit from this arrangement, and the user is effectively getting a better deal. \n\nSo from a fairness standpoint, if the rent is split equally, and the user is getting $30 from Y, that creates an unequal payment structure without X's consent. However, if the user and Y agreed that Y would pay the user to have the bigger room, and the total rent remains the same, then maybe it's a valid arrangement. But X might feel left out because he didn't get a chance to negotiate. \n\nThe user's actions might be seen as unfair to X because the arrangement affects all three. By receiving $30 from Y, the user is effectively reducing their own rent by $30, which could be considered a benefit they shouldn't have if the original rent split was equal. However, if the apartment's total rent is split equally, and the user is just getting a side payment from Y, then it's a different matter. \n\nIn summary, the user might be in the wrong if the initial agreement was to split rent equally regardless of room size, and their arrangement with Y creates an unequal payment structure without X's consent. However, if the room size was supposed to affect rent, then the user's arrangement with Y could be fair. Since the original question doesn't specify the initial rent agreement, but the user mentions that Y wanted the big room because of income disparity, it's possible that the initial plan was to have a fair random selection, but the subsequent deal between Y and the user might not consider X's perspective. \n\nTherefore, the user is likely in the wrong because the arrangement affects all three roommates, and X wasn't included in the decision. The user should have discussed the possibility of different rent based on room size with all roommates before making a private deal with Y. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
