Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The question is whether the author scammed their roommate by charging an extra $30 for the bigger room.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. Three people moved into an apartment with three rooms. Two smaller rooms and one bigger. Before moving in, the author asked who wanted the big room. Roommate Y wanted it, but when the author suggested a bid or a random draw, Y said it wasn't fair because the author had a higher income. So they did a random draw, and the author won. Then after three days, Y changed their mind and offered to pay $30 extra to swap. The author agreed. Now Roommate X is upset because the author is paying less rent for the bigger room, and he thinks the author is scamming him.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the perspective. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to determine based on the situation.\n\nLet me break it down. The key points here are the initial agreement and the fairness of the arrangement. When they moved in, they decided via a random draw that the author would get the big room. Then, after a few days, Y offered to pay $30 to switch. The author agreed. Now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less overall.\n\nIs there any mention of X being involved in the initial decision? The author says that before moving in, they asked X and Y who wanted the big room. X didn't care, Y wanted it. Then they did a random draw. So X wasn't involved in the initial decision. However, the problem is that X feels he's being treated unfairly now because the author is getting a better deal.\n\nBut in a roommate situation, unless there's a formal agreement, things can be a bit informal. The author and Y made a private agreement to swap rooms with compensation. X wasn't part of that. The question is whether the author should have included X in the discussion, but originally, X didn't care about the big room. Now, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for charging Y $30 to switch rooms? Well, if the original rent was split equally among three people, then the total rent would be divided by three. If the author is in the bigger room and Y is in a smaller one, but the author is paying $30 less, that's because part of the rent is being adjusted. But this is a private agreement between the author and Y. However, X is now upset because he's not part of that arrangement.\n\nBut when they first moved in, X didn't care about the big room, so he didn't participate in the initial allocation. The problem arises now because X feels the arrangement is unfair. The author's action of accepting $30 from Y to take the bigger room might not be fair to X if the original rent split wasn't adjusted accordingly. If the three roommates are splitting the total rent equally, then the author's room is bigger, but the rent is split equally. However, the author is getting a bigger room for the same rate as the others, but then Y is paying the author $30 to switch. That might mean that the author's total payment is lower than the others. So if the total rent is, say, $1500, each would pay $500, but the author is getting the bigger room for $500, and Y is paying $470, and X pays $500. That's an issue because X is paying the same as the author for a smaller room, while Y is paying less. But actually, the author is in the bigger room, but Y is paying the author $30, so the author would effectively be getting $30 more each month. But if the rent isn't adjusted, then the author is still paying the same as others but getting a bigger room. Wait, but the author says that Y agreed to pay $30 of the author's rent. So if the author is supposed to pay $500, Y is paying $30 to the author, so the author's net payment is $470, while X pays $500. That's the problem. So X is paying more for a smaller room. The author is essentially getting a bigger room for less money, and Y is paying less because he's in a smaller room. But X is in the same boat as Y, paying the same amount as before but in a smaller room.\n\nThe issue is that the original rent split didn't account for room sizes. If the rent is split equally regardless of room size, then the author is getting a bigger room for the same price, which might be unfair. However, the author and Y made an arrangement where Y pays $30 to the author to switch. But since X is also part of the agreement to split rent, he's not included in this arrangement. So X is now paying the same as before but in a smaller room, while the author is in the bigger room and effectively paying less. But if the initial rent was split equally, then maybe X is right to feel that the author is getting an unfair advantage. But perhaps the initial agreement was that the big room would be allocated via random draw, and the author won it. So the author's room was supposed to be the big one. Then Y wanted to switch and offered money. The author accepted. But if the rent wasn't adjusted, then the author is in a better position. However, if the author is receiving money from Y to take the big room, then the author's net rent is lower than others. So X is paying the same as before but in a smaller room, while the author is in a bigger room for less. That's the point of contention.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong by accepting $30 from Y to switch rooms, thereby effectively getting a better deal. The problem is that X wasn't part of the initial room allocation but is now affected by the switch. However, X didn't care about the big room initially, so maybe it's a problem of the original rent split not accounting for room sizes. If the original agreement was to split rent equally regardless of room size, then the author's arrangement with Y is causing X to pay more for a smaller room. That's unfair from X's perspective.\n\nBut the author didn't consider that when making the deal with Y. The author might be in the wrong for not considering X's position when making the arrangement. Alternatively, since X didn't care about the big room, maybe the author and Y had the right to make a private agreement. However, the fact that this arrangement causes X to pay more for a smaller room could be seen as unfair, especially if the total rent isn't adjusted. If the total rent is split equally, then the author is getting a bigger room for the same price, and Y is in a smaller room but paying less. X is in a smaller room and paying the same as before. So the author's arrangement with Y is causing X to be in a worse position without his consent.\n\nIn that case, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing the fairness with X. The author should have considered that changing the room allocation between Y and the author affects X's position. Therefore, the author should have involved X in the arrangement. Since the author didn't, X feels wronged. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the author didn't address the impact on X when making the deal with Y. The original agreement was a random draw which X accepted, but the subsequent arrangement between the author and Y creates an unfair situation for X without his consent.\n"
