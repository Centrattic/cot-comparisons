Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by arranging to charge one roommate an extra $30 a month to switch rooms. Let me go through the details again.\n\nFirst, the setup: three roommates in a three-bedroom apartment. One room is 40% bigger. Initially, they decide to randomly assign the big room using a random generator. The author wins. Then, after three days, Y asks to switch, offering $30/month more. The author agrees, so Y gets the big room and pays the author $30/month. Now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less rent.\n\nSo, the key points here. The original agreement was random selection, which the author won. Then Y wanted to switch and the author allowed it with a financial arrangement. The problem arises because X feels left out and that the author is exploiting the situation. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider fairness. The initial method was random, which is fair. Then, when Y wanted to switch, the author offered a deal where Y pays an extra $30/month. Since the room is bigger, perhaps the author could argue that the bigger room is worth more, so charging a premium is fair. However, the issue is that X wasn't part of this agreement. The original agreement between the author and Y might not consider X's perspective. \n\nBut when they moved in, the author asked both X and Y who wanted the big room. Y wanted it, X didn't care. So maybe the author's arrangement with Y is separate from X's situation. However, X is now paying the same rent as the author for a smaller room, which he might feel is unfair. The author is effectively receiving a subsidy from Y, which might not be equitable to X. \n\nAnother angle: if the rent is split equally among all three, the author is getting a discount for staying in the bigger room, and Y is paying more. But if the author is charging Y $30/month, that means Y is effectively paying $30 more total to have the bigger room. But does that mean X is paying the same as the author, even though his room is smaller? That might be the crux of X's complaint. \n\nThe author's initial solution was to let Y take the big room if he pays an extra $30. But this arrangement might not be fair to X, who's stuck in a smaller room without any financial compensation. So, maybe the author should have adjusted the rent so that everyone pays according to the room size. However, the author didn't do that and instead made a side deal with Y, which benefits the author and Y but leaves X out. \n\nIn roommate situations, it's usually best practice to have all roommates agree on rent distribution based on room size. If the big room is worth more, maybe the rent should be split proportionally. The author's arrangement with Y without consulting X might be seen as unfair to X, hence why X is upset. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because the agreement with Y affects X's share of the rent. By not involving X in the decision about how much each room is worth, the author created an imbalance. Even if the author and Y had a separate agreement, the fact that X is now paying the same rent for a smaller room could be considered unfair, making the author's actions potentially unethical or inconsiderate.\n"
