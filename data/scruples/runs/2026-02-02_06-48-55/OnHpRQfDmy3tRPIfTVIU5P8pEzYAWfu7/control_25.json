Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about roommates splitting rent and room sizes. The apartment has three bedrooms, one bigger than the others. The author, Y, and X are roommates. Initially, they had a random draw to determine who gets the bigger room, which the author won. Then Y asked for the room and offered to pay $30 extra each month for it. The author agreed, leading to X being upset because he feels the author is getting a better deal.\n\nFirst, I need to check if the initial arrangement was fair. The author and Y had a random draw, which seems fair. The author won, so they got the bigger room. Then Y wanted to switch, so they made a deal where Y pays $30 more to take the room. That part seems like a mutual agreement between the author and Y. The problem arises when X feels left out and that the author is now paying less rent because of the deal.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did the author have the right to make a deal with Y without consulting X? Since there were three roommates, any changes in rent or room assignments might affect all of them. If the original agreement was a random draw, maybe the author thought it was their room for the duration. However, when Y offered money to switch, the author accepted. But if the initial rent split wasn't adjusted based on room sizes, maybe the author shouldn't unilaterally decide to take extra money from Y without X's input.\n\nWait, the question is about whether the author is scamming the roommate (X). The author is paying $30 less than X because they got the bigger room? Wait, actually, the author is getting the bigger room but paying $30 less? Or is Y paying $30 more? Let me clarify. The author says, \"if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me.\" So Y is paying 30$ extra, meaning the author is getting 30$ from Y, so the author's total rent would be reduced by 30$, and Y's would be increased. So the author ends up paying less than X and Y. Wait, but if the total rent is split among the three, then maybe the initial split was equal. If the author is now getting 30$ from Y, that would mean the author's share is effectively lower. So X is paying the same as before, but the author is paying 30$ less. That's why X is upset.\n\nSo the issue is whether the author can adjust their own rent by getting money from another roommate without the third being involved. The problem is that typically, rent is split equally unless there's an agreement to adjust for room sizes. If the original agreement was equal split, then the author's arrangement with Y might be altering the original terms. If X was part of the original agreement, the author shouldn't make a side deal that affects X's portion. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't involve X in the decision, leading to unequal payments. However, if the original agreement allowed for room size-based adjustments, then maybe it's okay. But since X wasn't part of the deal, he feels cheated. So the author's mistake was not including X in the agreement. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). Alternatively, if the initial agreement was flexible, then maybe not. But since the author and Y made a deal without X's knowledge, it's possible that the author is at fault.\n"
