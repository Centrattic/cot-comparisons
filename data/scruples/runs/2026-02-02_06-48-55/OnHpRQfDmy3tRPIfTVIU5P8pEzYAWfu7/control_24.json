Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates and the allocation of a bigger room. \n\nSo, the setup is that three people moved into an apartment with three bedrooms. One room is 40% bigger. Before moving in, the author, X, and Y were deciding who gets the bigger room. Y wanted it, but when considering income, they decided to randomize it, and the author won. Then, after three days, Y asked to switch, offering to pay $30/month more. The author agreed, so Y now has the big room and pays extra. Now, X is upset because the author is paying less rent than X.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. \n\nFirst, the initial agreement was randomized, so the author got the room fairly. Then, Y approached and offered to pay more to switch. The author agreed, which seems like a mutual agreement between the author and Y. The problem arises because X feels left out and that the author is getting an unfair advantage by paying less. \n\nNow, the issue is whether the author should have included X in the decision-making process. But initially, the room assignment was settled between all three. However, when Y wanted to switch, the author only negotiated with Y. X wasn't part of that negotiation. \n\nBut in roommate situations, typically, each roommate has their own arrangement regarding rent split unless there's a specific agreement otherwise. If the rent was split equally among three, but someone is paying extra to another roommate for room preferences, that might be a separate agreement. However, if X is paying the same as the author but the author is getting a larger room for less rent (because Y is paying $30 to the author), that could create an imbalance. \n\nBut the author says that the $30 is from Y to the author. So, maybe the total rent paid by Y is higher, and the author is compensated, so overall, the apartment's total rent isn't changed. However, if the original agreement was that everyone pays the same, then this side agreement might disrupt that. But if the original agreement was that the room assignments are separate, then maybe it's okay. \n\nThe crux is whether the author had the right to make a private agreement with Y without consulting X. Since the initial room assignment involved all three, maybe X felt left out. But if the deal between Y and the author is a separate agreement (like a rent adjustment), then it's between those two. However, if the room assignments affect the overall fairness of the apartment's rent distribution, then maybe the author should have included X. \n\nIn roommate situations, when one person pays more for a room, it's usually done with the knowledge of all roommates. If X wasn't informed or agreed to this arrangement, it might be seen as unfair. But the author didn't take extra money from X; instead, Y is paying the author. \n\nSo, it's a bit tricky. If the author and Y made a private deal without informing X, and X's rent isn't being adjusted, then X might feel that the author is benefiting unfairly. But if the total rent remains the same among all three, and X pays the same as before, maybe it's not the author's fault. However, if the author's rent was effectively reduced by $30 because Y is paying that extra, then the author is indeed paying less than X and Y, which could be seen as unfair. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not considering that the arrangement could affect the fairness between all three roommates. The initial agreement was random, but changing it later with a side payment without including X might be the issue. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
