Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about roommates deciding who gets the bigger room and how the rent is split.\n\nFirst, the setup: Three roommates. Two smaller rooms and one bigger. Before moving in, they had to decide. The author wanted the big room, as did Y. They tried to decide by random.org, and the author won. But then Y wanted the room again after three days, so they made a deal where Y pays $30 a month for the big room. Now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. When they moved in, the initial agreement was that the author got the big room via a random draw. Then, after three days, Y approached again. The author agreed to a new arrangement where Y pays $30/month. The problem now is that X feels this wasn't fair and that the author is scamming him by getting a better deal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. If all three roommates were part of the decision-making process, then maybe the author should have involved X in the deal. But in the story, X wasn't involved in the initial random draw. The author and Y decided between themselves. So maybe X didn't have a say, which could lead to his feelings of unfairness now.\n\nAlso, when they split the rent, if the total rent is divided equally, but the author is paying less because of a private agreement, then technically, the author is paying less than their share. That might be the issue. If the total rent is split equally, but the author is effectively paying $30 less, then X is effectively paying more. Unless the $30 is given to X or the total rent is adjusted accordingly.\n\nWait, the story says that the author and Y made a private deal. So if the total rent is split equally among all three, the author's share would normally be 1/3. But if Y is paying the author $30/month, then the author's actual out-of-pocket is 1/3 - $30, while Y's is 1/3 + $30. But X is still paying 1/3. That would mean that X is effectively subsidizing the author's deal. So X might feel that he's paying more to let the author have the bigger room without him getting any compensation.\n\nSo the problem here is that the agreement between the author and Y might not be equitable to X. If the three roommates weren't all in agreement about the rent split based on room size, then the author's private deal with Y could be seen as unfair to X. Even if the author and Y thought it was fair, if the total rent isn't adjusted for X's portion, then X is losing out.\n\nAnother angle: Did the initial agreement (random.org) apply to all three roommates? If the initial agreement was only between the author and Y, then X wasn't part of it. So X might not have been aware that the big room was up for grabs. Now, when the author made a private arrangement with Y, X could feel left out. The initial decision to not involve X in the room assignment might be part of the problem.\n\nAlso, when dealing with roommates, it's common to have all parties agree on room assignments and rent splits. If the author and Y made a deal without consulting X, that could be the issue. Even if X didn't care initially, after the fact, he's upset about the financial implications. So the author might be in the wrong because they didn't ensure that the arrangement was fair to everyone involved.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's deal with Y might have been a private agreement that didn't consider X's position. Since the rent is split equally, but the author is effectively paying less, X ends up paying more for the same room size. This could be seen as unfair. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't get X's consent or adjust the rent split to include all parties, leading to an unequal distribution that's causing conflict.\n"
