Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for \"scamming\" their roommate. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the three roommates moved into an apartment with three rooms. Two smaller and one bigger. Before moving in, the author asked who wanted the big room. Roommate X didn't care, and Y wanted it. The author also wanted it. They considered randomizing or auctioning it. Y said auctioning wasn't fair because they don't earn as much as the author. So they went with a random.org roll, and the author got the big room.\n\nThree days later, Y changed their mind and wanted the big room. The author said Y had to pay $30 extra per month for the author to give up the room. Y agreed. Now X is upset because he's paying the same rent as Y for a smaller room, and he thinks the author is scamming him by getting a discount.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is, but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Let's think about fairness. The initial decision was a random roll, which both Y and the author agreed to. Then, when Y wanted to switch, they made a mutual agreement where Y pays $30 more for the bigger room. So, the author isn't taking money from X; they're adjusting the rent between themselves and Y. But X is upset because he's not part of this arrangement and feels the author is getting a better deal.\n\nBut from a fairness standpoint, when they initially split the rent, was it based on room size? If the apartment is split into three rooms, but two are smaller and one is bigger, the rent division might not be equal. If they were splitting the rent equally, that could be an issue. But the author and Y made a private agreement to adjust the rent for the bigger room. So X is paying the same as Y, but the author is paying 30 less. That might be why X is upset.\n\nHowever, if the original agreement was that everyone pays the same, then the author changing the rent without consulting X could be unfair. But if they were allowed to negotiate differences in rent based on room size, then the author and Y's arrangement is acceptable. The problem is that X wasn't part of the negotiation and now feels wronged.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the initial agreement allowed for different payments based on room size, then no. But if the initial agreement was equal rent for everyone, then the author's arrangement with Y might be unfair to X. The author didn't ask X's opinion, so maybe they should have included him in the discussion. But the main issue is whether the author's agreement with Y affects X's rent. If X's rent is still the same as Y's, but the author's rent is lower, then X is the one being inconvenienced. However, if the author and Y are handling the extra cost between themselves, then maybe it's their deal. But X isn't part of that deal, so he might feel he's being treated unfairly. \n\nI think the key is whether the original rent split was based on room size. If not, and the author is now paying less without consulting X, then maybe the author is in the wrong. But if the original agreement allowed for individual room-based rent, then the author isn't at fault. The problem here is that X wasn't informed or involved in the decision, so maybe the author should have discussed it with everyone. However, the author's action was with Y, who wanted the bigger room. If the author and Y can agree to a different rent split, and X is just upset because he's not getting the same benefit, then the author isn't scamming anyone. It's more about fairness in the overall rent division. \n\nAlternatively, maybe all three should have negotiated room assignments and rent splits upfront. The author handled it with Y, but X wasn't part of it, leading to his grievance. So maybe the author is at fault because they didn't include X in the discussion, leading to an unequal rent situation. However, the initial random draw was fair, and the subsequent negotiation between author and Y was agreed upon. If the total rent paid by all three remains the same, but the author is paying less because Y is taking the bigger room, then maybe that's acceptable. But if X is paying the same as Y, but the author is paying less, that creates an imbalance. \n\nWait, the author says that the rent is split three ways. If the author is paying $30 less per month, then the other two are effectively paying $30 more each. Because the total rent is fixed. Let me check: if the author is paying $30 less, then the remaining $30 is being covered by Y and X? No, because the author and Y agreed that Y pays $30 extra. So Y is paying $30 more than the author. So if the total rent is split equally, then Y is paying $30 more than the author, and X is paying the same as the author. So X is paying the same as the author, but Y is paying $30 more. That would mean that the total rent would be (author's share) + (Y's share) + X's share. If the author's share is $30 less than Y's, but X is the same as the author, then Y is paying $30 more than X as well. So X is not getting any extra; he's paying the same as the author. \n\nBut X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is in the bigger room but paying less. So X is in the same situation as before, but now Y is paying more. The author's arrangement with Y makes the author's rent lower, but X's rent remains the same. So from X's perspective, he's paying the same as the author, but the author is in a bigger room. However, if Y is paying more, that's to compensate for the bigger room. But X isn't part of that. \n\nThe problem here is that the initial agreement for room assignments and rent was based on a random draw, which was agreed upon. Then, a separate agreement between the author and Y to adjust rent for the room. The author isn't scamming X; the issue is that X is upset because he wasn't part of the agreement and feels the rent distribution is unfair. \n\nBut if the rent is split three ways, and Y is paying $30 more than the author, then X is paying the same as the author. So the author's rent is lower, but Y's is higher. X is in the middle. So X's grievance is about the fact that the author is in the bigger room but pays less. But in reality, Y is the one paying for it. So the author isn't taking money from X; Y is effectively paying a premium. So X is not being scammed. However, X might feel that the initial agreement was equal rent, so now the author is getting a discount, which is unfair. \n\nBut if the original agreement didn't specify equal rent based on room size, then the author and Y's arrangement is valid. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. X is upset because he didn't get involved, but the author and Y's agreement is their own. However, if the total rent is split equally and the author is getting a discount, then the author is effectively taking a portion from X. Wait, no. If the total rent is split equally, then each pays a third. If the author is paying $30 less, then the others are paying $30 more each. Wait, no, because the author and Y agreed that Y pays $30 more. So if the total rent is fixed, then the author's share is reduced by $30, but Y's share is increased by $30. The total remains the same. So X is still paying the same amount as before. \n\nBut if X is paying the same, but the author is in a bigger room, then X is in the same position as before. The problem arises because X is comparing his room size and rent to the author. But the author's lower rent is because Y is paying the $30. So X isn't losing money. Therefore, the author isn't scamming X. The author is in the right. Therefore, answer B.\n"
