Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. The situation is about dividing a bigger room in an apartment. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, three people moved in together: the author (let's say A), X, and Y. The apartment has three bedrooms, with one being 40% bigger. Before moving in, A asked who wants the big room. Y wanted it, but when A suggested a bidding war or random selection, Y argued about fairness because of income differences. So they used a random number generator, and A won. Then, after three days, Y asked to switch, offering to pay $30 extra per month. A agreed, so now Y pays $30 more to A each month to take the bigger room. Now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and A is paying less rent than him. X thinks A is scamming him.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether A is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The initial allocation was done via a fair random selection. Then, after A got the room, Y approached and offered a deal. Since the room sizes are different, the rent per person isn't the same. The question is: does Y's deal with A affect X in a way that makes A at fault?\n\nFirst, legally, if the original agreement allowed for room assignments and potential rent adjustments, then a private agreement between two roommates might be okay. But if the original lease is split equally, then one person paying more to another might not be recognized by the landlord, which could cause issues. However, the problem here is about fairness among roommates, not the landlord.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, X didn't participate in the initial selection. The initial decision was between Y and A, with a random draw. Then, when Y wanted to switch, A agreed to a deal. X is upset because he feels the arrangement is unfair as he's in a smaller room and A is paying less. But did A have a duty to include X in the deal? The initial agreement was between A and Y, not involving X. However, X is part of the household and the total rent is split among all three. If the original rent split was equal, but now A is receiving $30 from Y, does that affect X's share?\n\nWait, maybe the original rent is divided equally among the three. If A is paying $30 less because Y is paying A, then effectively Y is paying an extra $30 to A, which might mean Y is effectively paying more in total. But from X's perspective, he's paying the same as A did before. So X is now paying the same as A (who is getting $30 from Y), so X is effectively paying more compared to Y. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.\n\nOriginal scenario: all three share the same rent. Let's say total rent is R, each pays R/3. After the deal, Y is paying A $30, so Y's total payment is R/3 + $30. A's payment is R/3 - $30 (since Y gives A $30). But X is still paying R/3. So X is paying the same as before, but compared to A, X is paying more. But compared to Y, X is paying less than Y. So X is upset because he's in a smaller room and A is paying less. So he feels it's unfair that A is getting a better deal.\n\nBut is that fair? If the room sizes are different, then maybe the rent should be adjusted according to room size. However, if the original agreement was to split the rent equally regardless of room size, then the deal between A and Y might be a side agreement to adjust for the room size. However, X wasn't part of that agreement. So if the original arrangement was equal rent split, then the side deal between A and Y might not be fair to X.\n\nBut the problem is that the initial selection of the big room was done between A and Y. If the room sizes affect the rent, then maybe all three should have agreed on a way to split the rent based on room sizes. If the original lease didn't account for that, the side deal might be necessary but not inclusive of all roommates.\n\nAlternatively, maybe X should have been involved in the initial selection. The initial problem was that A and Y decided without involving X. Wait, the initial setup was that there are three rooms. But the problem is that there are three people and three rooms, each person gets a room. The big room was up for grabs. If all three wanted to decide who gets the big room, but only A and Y discussed it, then X wasn't part of that. That might have been an issue. But the user says that they asked X and Y who wanted the big room. X said he didn't care, Y wanted it. Then they did a random selection between A and Y. So X didn't want the big room, so he wasn't part of the initial selection. That seems fair.\n\nThen, after the initial selection, when Y approaches A to switch, it's a separate agreement between A and Y. However, the problem is that this affects the rent distribution. If the total rent is split equally, but now Y is paying A extra to switch rooms, then Y is effectively paying more in total, and A is paying less. X is still paying the same. So X is left in a situation where he's in a smaller room but not getting any financial compensation, while A is in a bigger room and paying less. X is upset because he feels it's unfair compared to A.\n\nIs the side deal between A and Y ethical? In rooming situations, sometimes people adjust rent based on room sizes. If the original lease allowed for that, then it's okay. If not, then the side deal might not be recognized by the landlord, but among roommates, it's common to adjust. However, in this case, X wasn't part of the agreement, so he might feel excluded.\n\nThe question is whether A is in the wrong. If the original selection was fair (random between A and Y after X didn't want the big room), and then a mutual agreement between A and Y to switch rooms with a financial adjustment, then A isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, X's complaint is that A is receiving money from Y, which makes X pay more per square meter or something. But if the original agreement didn't include room sizes in rent, then the side deal is between two parties. However, since it affects the third roommate, maybe A should have involved X in the initial selection or the financial arrangement.\n\nBut if X didn't want the big room and didn't participate in the initial selection, then A and Y's deal might be their own. However, the fact that X is now paying the same rent for a smaller room while A is getting a bigger room and paying less is causing conflict. Maybe the right approach would have been to adjust the rent so that everyone's payment reflects their room size. But since that wasn't done, the side deal between A and Y is leading to X feeling unfair.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because the financial arrangement between A and Y affects X, who wasn't part of the agreement. However, if the original selection was fair and the side deal was mutual, then A isn't necessarily at fault. It's a bit of a gray area. But from an ethical standpoint, maybe A should have considered X's position, even though X didn't want the big room. Since X's payment isn't adjusted, he's at a disadvantage compared to A. Therefore, A might be in the wrong. But I'm not sure. The initial selection was fair, and the side deal was mutual. So maybe A isn't in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
