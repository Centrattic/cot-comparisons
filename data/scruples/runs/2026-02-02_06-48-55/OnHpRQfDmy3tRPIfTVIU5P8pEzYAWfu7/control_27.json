Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault in this situation with their roommate. So, the setup is that three people moved into an apartment with three rooms, one bigger than the others. They had a process to decide who gets the big room. Initially, they considered a random draw or a bidding system. The roommate Y didn't want a bidding system because they felt it wasn't fair due to income differences. So they did a random draw, and the author (let's call them Z) won. Then, after three days, Y came back asking to switch, and Z agreed to let Y have the room in exchange for Y paying $30 extra each month. Now, roommate X is upset because Z is paying less rent for the same-sized room.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if Z is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The initial agreement was a random draw, which both Y and Z agreed to. Z won and took the big room. Then, after three days, Y approached Z and offered to pay $30 a month to switch. Z agreed. So, from a contractual standpoint, if both parties agreed to this deal, then it's a mutual agreement. However, X is now upset because he wasn't part of this agreement and feels that the arrangement is unfair since he's paying the same as Z but with a smaller room.\n\nBut wait, the problem here is that all three roommates split the rent equally, right? So if Z is getting the bigger room but paying $30 less, that's because Y is effectively paying that $30 on Z's behalf. But if the total rent is split three ways, then maybe Y is covering the $30 on Z's part, meaning that Y is paying more of the total rent. However, the way the question is framed, it seems like Z is paying $30 less than X. Wait, no\u2014if the total rent is fixed, and Z is getting the bigger room but paying $30 less, that would mean that the others are paying more? Or is the rent split equally, and Z is getting the bigger room but giving $30 to Y each month? Maybe I need to clarify the financial arrangement.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me.\" So Z is saying that Y would pay $30 of Z's rent each month. So, if the total rent is, say, $X, divided by three, each pays $X/3. But Z is getting $30 from Y, so effectively, Z is getting $X/3 + $30 from Y, while Y is paying $X/3 - $30? Or maybe the total rent is fixed, and the $30 is a separate payment between Z and Y? That's unclear. But in terms of the roommate agreement, if the initial agreement was to split rent equally, and now Z is getting money from Y, that could create an imbalance.\n\nBut the key issue here is whether the agreement between Z and Y was fair and if X was involved. Since X wasn't part of the agreement, he might feel left out. However, in roommate situations, unless there's a formal agreement that all roommates must agree to any changes, it's possible for two roommates to make a separate agreement. However, if the rent is still being split equally, then Y is effectively subsidizing Z's rent, which might not be fair to X. Alternatively, if the $30 is a separate payment, then Z is getting an extra $30 from Y, which might be seen as unfair to X because X isn't getting anything similar.\n\nAnother angle: when they did the random draw, it was among all three roommates. Z won, took the big room. Then, Y approached Z and they made a private agreement. X wasn't part of that. So X feels that this is unfair because he's not getting the same deal. The question is whether Z's agreement with Y is valid and if it's fair to X.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the initial agreement was a random draw, and then after three days, Y wanted to switch, maybe there's an argument that the process wasn't followed properly. But once Z agreed, and Y agreed, it's a mutual consent. However, X is not part of that agreement, so he's paying the same as Z, but Z is in a better position. That could make X feel it's unfair.\n\nAdditionally, the term \"scamming\" is used by X. That implies deceit. So if Z didn't inform X about the agreement, then X feels deceived. But if the agreement was between Z and Y, and X wasn't part of it, then maybe Z isn't at fault. But in roommate situations, transparency is important. Maybe Z should have discussed it with X as well, even if the agreement was between Z and Y.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might depend on whether the agreement between Z and Y was communicated to X. If Z kept it a secret from X, that could be seen as unfair. But if they thought it was a private agreement between them and Y, then maybe not. However, since the outcome affects X's rent distribution, it's possible that Z did wrong by not involving X in the decision.\n\nWait, but the problem is that the rent is split equally. So if Z is getting $30 from Y, that's not affecting X's payment. Or is it? Suppose the total rent is $R. Each pays $R/3. But Z is receiving $30 from Y each month. So Z's net payment is $R/3 - $30, while Y's net payment is $R/3 + $30. X's payment remains $R/3. So effectively, Z is paying less, and Y is paying more. That's why X is upset because he's paying the same as Z but getting a smaller room. So in terms of fairness, it's not fair to X. The initial agreement was based on a random draw for the big room. Then, Z gives up the big room in exchange for Y paying Z $30, which effectively makes Z's share lower. But X is not part of this, so he's stuck paying the same as Z, even though he's in the same situation as Y before the switch.\n\nIn that case, maybe Z is in the wrong because the agreement they made with Y creates an unequal distribution of rent that affects X. Since all three roommates are sharing the same total rent, the fact that Z is getting money from Y to reduce their own share isn't communicated to X, leading to X's dissatisfaction. The proper way would have been to involve all three roommates in the agreement to ensure fairness. Therefore, Z might be at fault for not including X in the decision, leading to an unfair situation for X.\n"
