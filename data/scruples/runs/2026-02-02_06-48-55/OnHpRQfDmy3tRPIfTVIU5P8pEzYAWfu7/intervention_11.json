Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is living in an apartment with two roommates, X and Y. The apartment has three rooms of different sizes. Initially, before moving in, they had a discussion about who would get the bigger room. Y wanted it, but when the author suggested a random selection or a bidding process, Y argued against bidding because of income disparity. So they rolled a random number generator, and the author won.\n\nThen, three days later, Y changed his mind and wanted the big room. The author agreed to let Y have it if Y paid $30 extra each month. Now, X is upset because he thinks the author is scamming him by getting a financial advantage. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the initial agreement was random selection. The author then made a private agreement with Y to transfer the big room for $30/month. But X wasn't part of that agreement. From X's perspective, he and the author are both paying the same rent for smaller rooms, but the author is getting a financial benefit (paying $30 less) without X being involved. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the original agreement was that the big room would be assigned randomly, and then the author later sells it to Y for a price that affects X's rent indirectly, maybe that's where the issue is. Because X's rent structure might be based on an equal split unless there's a different arrangement. Alternatively, if the total rent is fixed and the author is just adjusting how they split the rent among themselves, then the author might be creating an unfair advantage without consulting everyone.\n\nBut wait, in roommate situations, it's common for people to have different arrangements. However, if the original agreement involved a random selection, then the author's right to the big room was decided fairly. Then, when Y wanted to switch, the author could set terms. However, if X is paying an equal share of the rent, but the author is getting $30 less because Y is paying that extra, that might create an imbalance. X might feel that the author is profiting from the situation without justification, especially if the total rent paid by Y is covering the author's share, making X's share effectively higher.\n\nBut maybe the key is whether the author and Y's arrangement was done without X's consent. Since X wasn't part of the initial agreement, he might not be aware of it. However, in roommate situations, usually, any changes to rent or room assignments should be discussed with all roommates. The author made a deal with Y without including X, which could be seen as unfair because X's rent might be affected. If the total rent for the apartment is split equally, and the author is getting $30 from Y, that's an internal transfer, but X isn't part of it. This could create a situation where X ends up paying more indirectly. For example, if the total rent is split three ways, and Y is paying extra to the author, maybe the author is effectively getting a discount on their share, making X's share higher. \n\nAlternatively, if the $30 is just a personal agreement between Y and the author, and the total rent to the landlord remains the same, then X isn't directly affected. But the problem is that X perceives it as unfair because he's in the same situation as the author but is paying more. The author is in a better position without X's consent. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not involving X in the decision-making process. \n\nThe original agreement was between the author and Y, but since X is also a roommate, any changes that affect the fairness of the rent distribution should involve all parties. By not discussing with X, the author might have acted in their own interest without considering X's feelings. \n\nSo, considering that, the author is in the wrong because they didn't include all roommates in the decision, leading to perceived unfairness. The answer would be A.\n"
