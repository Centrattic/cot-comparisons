Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves roommates and the assignment of a bigger bedroom.\n\nFirst, the setup: there are three roommates moving into a three-bedroom apartment. One room is 40% bigger. Before moving in, the author asks X and Y who wants the big room. X doesn't care, Y wants it. The author also wants it, so they suggest either a random draw or a bidding system where the highest bidder pays more rent. Y objects to the bidding because of income disparity and suggests a random draw instead. They use a random number generator, and the author wins the big room.\n\nThen, three days later, Y comes back and demands the big room, offering to pay $30 a month to the author to switch. The author agrees. Now, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less rent, claiming the author is scamming him. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n\n1. The initial allocation was determined by a random draw after Y rejected a bid system due to fairness concerns. The author was given the big room fairly through a random method that Y agreed to.\n\n2. Y then later changes their mind and offers to pay $30/month to switch. The author agrees, which seems like a voluntary agreement between Y and the author. However, X is now upset because he wasn't part of this negotiation and feels the arrangement isn't fair.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's consider roommate agreements and fairness. Typically, in shared housing, room assignments and rent contributions can be negotiated as long as all parties agree. However, in this case, there might be an issue if the initial allocation was supposed to be a one-time decision. The problem arises because X wasn't involved in the later agreement between Y and the author. \n\nBut X was part of the initial setup where they agreed to the random draw. If all three were part of a shared rental agreement, perhaps each roommate has an equal share of the total rent, and the author is now receiving money from Y, which could be seen as altering the agreement without X's consent. \n\nHowever, if the room assignment was supposed to affect individual rent contributions (like having different room sizes justifying different rent splits), but that wasn't established upfront, then the author's acceptance of $30 from Y might create an imbalance in the shared rent. Since X is paying the same as the author but the author is getting $30 extra, that could create a disparity in their contributions. \n\nBut here's the thing: the original agreement was about who gets which room, not about splitting rent based on room size. If the total rent is split equally among all three, then the author is effectively receiving $30 from Y, which could be considered as the author getting an unfair advantage. But if the author is giving up their right to the big room in exchange for $30, maybe the author is just compensating Y for the better room. However, X wasn't part of that deal. \n\nAnother angle is that the author and Y made a private agreement without involving X. If the original agreement was that rooms are assigned via random draw and rent remains split equally, then changing that without X's consent could be seen as unfair. X might feel that the author is profiting from the arrangement while he's stuck in a smaller room without any compensation. \n\nBut the key question is whether the author is in the wrong. The original method was agreed upon by Y and the author. Y changed his mind, and the author allowed it for a price. X wasn't part of the initial agreement, but his complaint is about the financial disparity. If the total rent is split equally, and the author is getting $30 from Y, that's effectively the author getting paid to give up the big room, which might not be a fair distribution from X's perspective. \n\nHowever, if the author and Y's agreement is that Y pays the author $30 to switch rooms, then technically, Y is paying for the larger room, and the author is compensated for giving it up. If the total rent is still split equally among all three, then the author's effective rent is reduced by $30, while Y's is increased by $30. But X is not involved in that transaction. \n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, maybe the author is in the right because they had a valid agreement with Y, and X wasn't part of the initial assignment. But if the problem is that the author is now paying less rent than X, which could be seen as unfair in the shared living situation, then perhaps the author is in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the original agreement was that rooms are assigned via random draw and rent is split equally regardless, then the author and Y's private arrangement disrupts that. X might feel that the author shouldn't profit from the room assignment when the initial agreement was supposed to be fair. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's financial arrangement with Y violates the initial agreement. If the initial agreement was only about room assignment, not rent splitting, then maybe it's okay. However, if the room assignment was supposed to affect rent in a way that was agreed upon initially, then the author might be in the wrong. \n\nBut since the initial agreement didn't specify rent splitting based on room size, and the author and Y made a private deal without involving X, it's possible that the author is not in the wrong because they followed through with a voluntary agreement between themselves and Y. However, X's complaint is valid because he wasn't part of the process and now feels the financial burden is uneven. \n\nIn many roommate situations, any agreements about room assignments and extra payments should be discussed with all roommates to avoid conflicts. Since X wasn't included, even if the author and Y agreed, X's dissatisfaction is reasonable. But legally or ethically, the author might not be in the wrong if the agreement was between two parties. However, socially, it's possible that the author is seen as in the wrong because they didn't consider X's perspective. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the arrangement with Y affects X's experience. Even though the author and Y agreed, the financial disparity impacts X, and the author should have communicated with all roommates. Alternatively, if the agreement was between two roommates, maybe it's okay, but in the context of a shared living arrangement, it's better to include all. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering X's input.\n"
