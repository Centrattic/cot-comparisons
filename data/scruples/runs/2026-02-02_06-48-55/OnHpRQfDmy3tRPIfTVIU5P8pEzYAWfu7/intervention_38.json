Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is about roommates and the allocation of a bigger bedroom. \n\nFirst, the setup: three roommates in an apartment with three rooms, one bigger than the others. The author wanted the big room and initially decided to randomize it with a roommate, Y, who also wanted it. They used a random number generator, and the author won. Then, after three days, Y came back and wanted the big room, so the author offered a deal where Y could pay $30 extra each month to switch. Y agreed. Now, X is upset because the author is paying $30 less than X, even though their rooms are the same size.\n\nSo the main issue here is whether the author made a fair agreement. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nInitially, the author and Y decided to randomize the big room, which seems fair. The author won and got the room. Then Y came back and wanted it, so the author offered a price. Y agreed. The problem now is that X feels left out because the author is paying less. But X was the one who didn't care who got the big room. The original setup was between the author and Y. \n\nX's grievance is that the author is getting a better deal by paying less rent. But maybe X should have been part of the initial agreement. However, the author and Y resolved their conflict between themselves. If X wasn't part of the initial negotiation, is the author wrong for making a deal with Y? \n\nThe key point is whether the author should have included X in the arrangement. The initial problem was between two people (author and Y) over the big room. The author allowed Y to take the room in exchange for extra money, which Y agreed to. X wasn't part of that agreement. However, if all three roommates are splitting the rent equally, and the author is paying less because they're getting a larger room, that might be unfair. But in this case, the author adjusted the payment by the $30 to balance it out. So maybe the total rent each pays is equal? \n\nWait, the author says they pay $30 less. If the total rent is split equally, but the author is paying $30 less than X, that might mean the author is not contributing equally to the total rent. But if the agreement was that Y pays $30 extra to the author, then maybe the total rent each is paying is the same. For example, if the total rent is $1000, then each would normally pay $333.33. But the author is paying $30 less, so $303.33, and Y is paying $363.33. That way, the total is still $1000. But X is paying $333.33. So X is paying less than Y, but more than the author. Wait, this is confusing. Maybe the author adjusted their own rent to account for the bigger room. So if the big room is worth more, the author is effectively paying less because Y is compensating them. \n\nBut X is upset because his room is the same size as the author's, but he's paying more. The problem here is that the room allocation affects the rent split. If the big room is more valuable, then the rent should be split based on room size. However, the initial agreement was to randomize it, which might not account for room size. The author and Y then made a deal where Y pays extra to switch. But X didn't agree to this. \n\nSo the issue is whether the author should have involved X in the decision. X wasn't part of the initial negotiation, but now he's paying more because the author is in a bigger room. The author's action might have created an imbalance in the rent split. If the total rent is fixed and split equally, then the author is effectively getting a better deal. However, if the author is getting the bigger room and thus the higher-value room, they should be paying more, not less. \n\nWait, the author says they are paying $30 less. That seems contradictory. If the big room is more valuable, the author should be paying more, but they are paying less. That doesn't make sense unless there's a misunderstanding. If the author is getting a bigger room and paying less, that's unfair to X, who has a smaller room. But in this case, after the switch, Y has the big room. Wait, no: the author originally won the big room, then gave it to Y in exchange for $30. So Y is now in the big room and pays the author $30. So the author is in a smaller room and gets $30. But X is in a smaller room and pays regular rent. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe the $30 is part of the total rent. Let me clarify.\n\nIf the total rent is split equally, each pays the same amount. However, if the author is in a smaller room, they might expect to pay less. But in this case, the author is paying $30 less than X. So, if the total rent is $1000, the author pays $303.33, X pays $333.33, and Y pays $363.33. Wait, that adds up to $1000. The author is in a smaller room and pays less, Y is in a bigger room and pays more. X is in a medium room and pays the average. So X isn't paying less than Y, but more than the author. So X is paying more than the author because the author is in a smaller room. Wait, no. The author is in a smaller room and paying less, which is fair. But X is in a smaller room (same as the author's previous room) but paying more. Wait, maybe the author is in a small room now, same as X, but paying less. That's the problem. Because if both are in small rooms, they should be paying the same rent. But the author is paying $30 less. So X feels he's paying more for the same room. \n\nSo the root of the problem is that the author is getting a financial benefit (paying less) because they allowed Y to take the big room in exchange for $30. That $30 is an extra payment from Y to the author, which makes the author's rent lower than X's. Therefore, X is paying the same as before, but the author is now effectively paying less. That's unfair to X, because X's room size hasn't changed, but he's paying the same as before. The author's arrangement with Y has created an imbalance. \n\nSo, was the author wrong? They made a private agreement with Y that affected X's financial situation without consulting him. Even if X didn't care who got the big room, the financial arrangement between the author and Y has created an unfair situation for X. The author should have either included X in the rent adjustment or made sure that X's rent isn't affected. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the impact on X's rent and didn't involve him in the agreement, leading to an unequal distribution of rent based on room size.\n"
