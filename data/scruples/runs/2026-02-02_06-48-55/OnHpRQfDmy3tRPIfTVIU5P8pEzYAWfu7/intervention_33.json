Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. They moved into an apartment with two roommates, X and Y. The apartment has three bedrooms, with one being 40% bigger. Before moving in, the author asked X and Y who wanted the big room. X didn't care, but Y wanted it. The author also wanted it and suggested either random selection or a bid where the highest bidder (who could pay extra rent) would get it. Y thought bidding was unfair because the author had a higher income, so they went with a random draw via random.org, and the author won.\n\nThen, after three days, Y came back and wanted the big room for his bed. The author offered a deal: Y could have the room if he paid $30 extra each month. Y agreed. Now, X is upset because he thinks the author is scamming him since he and the author have the same size rooms but the author pays $30 less. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. Initially, the big room was decided by a random draw, which both parties agreed to. Then, after Y changed his mind, the author made a deal with Y to transfer the big room for $30/month. X wasn't part of that negotiation. So the issue is whether the author should have included X in the decision-making process regarding the room assignment and the financial arrangement.\n\nI think the key here is whether the room assignment and any adjustments in rent were part of the original agreement. When they moved in, they probably split the rent equally, but the big room might have a different value. If the author and Y made a private agreement without involving X, then X might feel that the rent distribution isn't fair anymore. Since the author is now paying less than X because they swapped the room with Y, X could see that as unfair. \n\nThe problem is that the room swap affected the rent distribution for all roommates, not just the two involved. If the original rent was split equally without considering room sizes, then the author and Y's agreement might create an imbalance. X might be right to feel that the author shouldn't have taken money from Y without considering the impact on the overall rent split. \n\nAlso, when they initially decided on the room assignment, X didn't mind which room he got. But once the author started paying less, X's situation changed. The author might have assumed that the $30 from Y covered the difference, but if the total rent is split equally among three people, then the author's effective contribution is actually less than the others. For example, if the total rent is $X, each pays $X/3. If Y gives $30 to the author, then the author's total is $X/3 - $30, while X and Y are each paying $X/3. That leaves the author with a $30 advantage, which X might see as unfair.\n\nIn terms of fairness, roommates usually split rent based on room size or through some agreed-upon method. The author and Y's private deal might not account for that. X wasn't part of that negotiation, so he might feel his rights as a roommate were overlooked. The author didn't consult X about the change in room assignments and the financial arrangement, which is a valid point of contention. \n\nSo, even though the initial selection was fair, the subsequent agreement between the author and Y created an imbalance that affects X. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the broader implications on the entire group's agreement. Roommate agreements typically require consensus or at least communication with all parties involved. By making a deal only with Y, the author didn't address how the rent would be fairly divided among all three roommates, leading to X's dissatisfaction.\n"
