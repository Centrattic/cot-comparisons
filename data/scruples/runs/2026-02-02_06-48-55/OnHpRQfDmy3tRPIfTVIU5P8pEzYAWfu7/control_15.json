Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about roommates splitting rent and the bigger room. The setup is three people in an apartment with three bedrooms, one of which is 40% bigger. The author and their roommates, X and Y, decided who would get the big room. Initially, they were going to flip a coin or something, and the author won. But after a few days, Y wanted the room and offered to pay $30 extra a month. The author agreed, so Y took the room and pays $30 more.\n\nNow, X is upset because he thinks the author is scamming him by getting a cheaper rent for the same-sized room. The question is whether the author did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the initial agreement. When they moved in, all three were supposed to split the rent. The big room was up for grabs through a random selection, which the author won. Then Y later wanted to swap, and they made a deal for $30 extra. But X wasn't part of that negotiation. \n\nThe main issue here is whether the deal between the author and Y affects X's situation. The apartment's total rent is split among the three. If the author is getting the big room via a random draw, then maybe the initial rent split wasn't adjusted for room sizes. However, when Y takes the big room and pays extra to the author, that could be seen as a private agreement. But if the total rent the apartment pays is fixed, then this extra $30 might not be part of the overall rent but rather a side payment between them. \n\nIn that case, X is still paying the same as the author, while Y is paying more. X might feel it's unfair because he's paying the same as the author but getting a smaller room, and the author isn't contributing more. But the author argues that the room was allocated fairly via a random draw and that the later deal with Y is about room preference. \n\nHowever, if the initial rent split didn't account for room sizes, then the author and Y's private deal might not actually make the rent fair in terms of room size. If all three were paying the same amount, but Y pays the author an extra $30, that might not be equitable unless the total rent is adjusted accordingly. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author should have involved X in the decision. Since the room allocation affects all roommates, changing the arrangement later might require agreement from everyone. By not consulting X, the author might have created a situation where X feels excluded and the rent distribution is unfair. \n\nSo, the key points are: 1) Did the author have the right to negotiate room swaps without consulting everyone? 2) Is the private agreement between author and Y affecting the fairness of the rent split for X? 3) Was the initial room allocation fair, and does the swap violate any prior agreements?\n\nIf the original agreement was a random draw for the big room, and then a later swap based on Y's desire to pay more, but without adjusting the overall rent structure, then X might be right to feel wronged. The author's side payment to Y could be seen as creating an unfair advantage, making X's contribution relatively lower compared to Y's. \n\nIn roommate situations, it's usually important that all parties agree to any changes in rent or room assignments. If the author and Y made a deal without X's consent, it's possible that X is justified in feeling that his share of the rent isn't being split fairly. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the group dynamic and didn't ensure that the rent distribution was equitable for everyone involved. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't involve X in the decision and created an imbalance in how the rent is split among the roommates.\n"
