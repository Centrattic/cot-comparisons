Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The scenario involves splitting a rent between three roommates with one bigger room.\n\nFirst, the setup: They moved into an apartment with three bedrooms\u2014two small and one big. The big room is 40% bigger. The author, X, and Y are the roommates. Before moving in, Y wanted the big room, and the author also wanted it. They had a discussion about how to decide who gets it. Y didn't want a bidding war because the author had a higher income, so they decided to flip a coin (or use random.org, as they did), and the author won.\n\nThen, after three days, Y changed his mind and asked to switch. The author agreed to let Y have the big room if Y paid $30 more per month. Y agreed. Now, X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is paying less. X thinks the author is scamming him by taking advantage.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the details.\n\nLet's break it down. When they initially decided who gets the big room, it was done via random.org. The author won. That seems fair at the time. Then Y wanted to switch, and they made a new agreement where the author gives up the room in exchange for $30/month. Y agreed. So the author is now in a smaller room, and Y is in the bigger one but paying more. But X is in a small room and paying the same as the author. So X feels he's being treated unfairly.\n\nThe key here is whether the author should have included X in the agreement. The initial decision between Y and the author might have been fair between the two, but since there are three roommates, maybe X's input was needed. The problem is that the author and Y made a private agreement without involving X, which might not be fair to X. Because X was also a roommate, and the rent split could be affected. If the big room is more expensive, maybe the rent should be adjusted accordingly, but the original setup didn't mention that. Now, by switching, the author is effectively getting a better deal (paying less for a smaller room), while X is stuck with a smaller room and the same rent. So X is upset because he feels he's being treated unfairly compared to the author.\n\nAnother angle: When the author and Y made the deal, did they consider the impact on X? Since X wasn't part of the initial decision about the room allocation, but the deal between Y and the author affects the overall fairness of the rent split among all three. The author might have created an unequal situation where X is paying the same as the author but in a similar-sized room, but the author is getting a discount. X feels he should have been part of the negotiations or that the arrangement should account for all three roommates.\n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not involving all roommates in the decision. Even if the initial agreement between Y and the author was fair between them, the fact that it affects X's experience means that the author should have considered X's perspective. By not involving X, the author might have acted in a way that's unfair to him, hence being in the wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if the room allocation and rent were agreed upon privately between the two who wanted the big room, maybe that's acceptable. But since X is now paying the same as the author for a smaller room, and the author is getting a smaller room for less, X's situation isn't comparable. The author might have known that X's room is the same size as Y's new room, so the author's room is smaller than Y's, but X's is same size as Y's. So X is in a similar situation as the author in terms of room size but paying the same as the author. Wait, no\u2014X is in a small room, same as the author's original room. But after the switch, the author is in a small room, Y is in the big room. So X is still in a small room, same as the author. So both X and the author are in small rooms, but the author is paying $30 less than Y. Wait, but X and the author are both in small rooms. Then why is X upset? Because he's paying the same as the author, but the author is getting a $30 discount compared to Y. So X is paying the same as the author, who has a smaller room but is getting $30 less. So X feels that the author is getting a better deal at his expense.\n\nBut how does the rent split work? If the total rent is split equally, and the author is getting $30 less from Y, then maybe the total rent is the same. Wait, maybe the $30 is an extra payment from Y to the author. Like, the total rent is split three ways, but Y is paying the author an extra $30 to compensate for the bigger room. In that case, the author's share would be the same, but Y is paying more overall. X is paying the standard share. So X is paying the same as the author, who has a smaller room, but the author is receiving $30 more from Y. That might make X feel like he's being treated unfairly because the author is getting money from Y, while X isn't.\n\nSo, in this case, the author is effectively profiting from the arrangement (getting $30 extra per month), while X is not. X might feel that he should also be compensated or that the arrangement should be adjusted for everyone. The author might be in the wrong by not considering that the deal between Y and the author creates an imbalance with X, especially if the initial agreement didn't involve X's input.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A: the author is in the wrong because the private agreement with Y affected X's experience without his input, leading to an unfair situation from X's perspective.\n"
