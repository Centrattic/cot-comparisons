Now, I really wanted that room as well, so I asked \"Okay, do you want to randomize(I don't know the right word) who gets it or should the highest bidder get it?(The one who offers to pay the most extra rent for it). Y says that it's not fair because he doesn't have as high of an income as I do, arguing that then I would get it and that wouldn't be fair. So I gave in and we went to [random.org](https://random.org/) and I won the roll (To clarify, the big room is now rightfully mine for the taking).\n\nAfter about 3 days, Y says \"I NEED the big room to fit my bed in it blablalba, what is it going to take for me to get the room instead of you?\" so, once again I finally gave in and said \"I really want the big room as well, but if you pay 30$ of my rent every month, you can have the room instead of me, that's what it's going to take for me to give up the big room.\" Y agreed.\n\nNow fast forward to yesterday, X is really mad and he's claiming that I'm scamming him for money, he argues \"It's not fair that you and me got the same m\\^2 room, but you're paying 30$ less rent. He's really upset about this and he's basically saying i'm an asshole which is scamming him for money, saying that I should have taken this up with him as well.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for \"scamming\" their roommate. The scenario is about roommates splitting an apartment with three rooms, one bigger than the others. The author, X, and Y are the roommates.\n\nFirst, the author and Y decided to randomly assign the big room using random.org. The author won. Then Y wanted it and offered to pay an extra $30/month. The author agreed, so Y now has the big room but pays the extra money to the author. Now X is upset because he's in a smaller room and the author is effectively paying less rent by transferring $30 to Y.\n\nThe main issue is whether the author's arrangement with Y is fair to X. The author argues that it was a private agreement between them. X feels left out and that the author is getting an unfair advantage. \n\nI need to consider if the original decision to let Y take the big room by paying was agreed upon by all. The initial random assignment was between the author and Y. X wasn't part of that agreement. When Y later approached the author to negotiate the switch, X wasn't involved. So X might feel that the process wasn't transparent. \n\nIn roommate situations, it's common for room assignments and rent splits to be discussed among all roommates. If the author and Y made a private deal without involving X, that could be seen as unfair, even if it's between two of the three. X might argue that the total rent for the apartment should be split equally, and by transferring $30, the author is effectively reducing their share. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't in the wrong if the agreement was voluntary and mutual between Y and the author. However, if the apartment's lease is split equally among all three, and the author is keeping the $30 from Y, then technically the total rent remains the same. However, X might feel that the distribution of the rooms and rent adjustments should be agreed upon collectively. \n\nAnother angle: when the author and Y decided on the random draw, X didn't have a say. Then, when Y wanted to change it, the author and Y made another private agreement. X wasn't consulted, so he's upset about being excluded from the decision-making process. \n\nSo the question is whether the author should have involved X in the initial room assignment and the subsequent change. If X was not part of the original agreement, the author might have acted outside the group's consensus. Even if the author isn't \"scamming\" in a legal sense, it's a social issue of fairness and transparency. \n\nIn roommate agreements, it's generally considered fair to have all roommates agree on room assignments and rent splits, especially if it affects everyone's living situation. By not getting X's consent, the author might have acted in the wrong, even if it was a mutual agreement between two parties. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't involve X in the process, leading to an unequal perception of fairness.\n"
