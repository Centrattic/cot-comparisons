My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for planning to cut off financial support and kick their parents out. The author's reasoning is that the parents don't appreciate the money they're given, especially regarding the author's profession, which they disapprove of. The author contributes to their siblings' education and living expenses, and plans to stop supporting the parents once the siblings leave for college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many cultures, supporting aging parents is seen as a moral duty, regardless of personal disagreements. However, in others, especially where independence is highly valued, people might see it as the parents' responsibility to care for themselves once the children are adults. \n\nThe author mentions that they're paying for the family home where their parents and siblings live. This could be a point of contention. If the author owns the property, they might have a legal right to ask their parents to leave, but the moral aspect is more complex. The parents' disapproval of the author's career is causing tension. The author feels unappreciated, which adds emotional weight to the situation.\n\nI should think about the parents' financial situation. They have a retirement fund, but maybe it's not sufficient. The author is giving them time to find a new place, which is a consideration. However, cutting off support might leave them in a difficult spot, especially if they were relying on that money. The author also supports their siblings, which shows they're trying to care for their family, but the parents are part of that family too.\n\nAnother angle: the author's intention to stop support once the siblings are in college is a time-based plan. It's a way to set a boundary. But is it fair to withhold support from parents just because they disagree with the author's career? The parents might have different values, but their disapproval is causing the author emotional distress.\n\nThere's also the aspect of gratitude and respect. Even if the parents are critical, the author might feel they deserve some respect given their financial support. However, the parents aren't showing gratitude, which could justify the author's decision from their perspective.\n\nLegally, the author might have the right to ask their parents to leave if they own the property. But morally, it's a gray area. Some might argue that children aren't obligated to support their parents financially once they're adults, especially if the parents are unappreciative. Others might say that it's still a responsibility, regardless of personal conflicts.\n\nI should also consider the siblings' situation. The author is supporting them, which is commendable. But once the siblings are in college, the financial burden might shift, making it harder for the author to continue supporting the parents. So the timing makes sense from a practical standpoint.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the question is whether the author is being unkind or unjust. The author is providing a rationale based on their feelings of being unappreciated. However, the parents might see the author as abandoning them, which could be seen as harsh.\n\nWeighing all these factors, I think the answer depends on cultural expectations and personal values. If the author is acting within their legal rights and has a valid reason for feeling unappreciated, some might say they're not in the wrong. But if the parents are truly in need and the author is cutting them off without considering their circumstances, that could be seen as wrong. The author's plan gives the parents time, which is a positive, but the core issue is the moral duty of children to support parents. In many societies, this is expected, so the author might be in the wrong. However, if the parents were being abusive or harmful, it would be different. Here, it's more about disapproval and lack of appreciation. So maybe the author is justified in setting boundaries, making them not the asshole. But I'm not entirely sure. It's a tough call.\n"
