My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who is 43, is supporting their parents and siblings financially. The parents don't agree with their profession, and every time the author visits, the parents are critical of their job. The author is considering cutting off financial support and kicking them out after the siblings go to college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and legal context. In many places, especially in Western cultures, adult children aren't legally obligated to support their parents. But there's a moral and cultural expectation sometimes. However, the author is already supporting their parents, which might be a point of contention here. \n\nThe parents are in their 60s and have a retirement fund. The author is giving them time to move, so it's not sudden. But the parents are not their legal responsibility. The siblings are being taken care of, which is their own children. The author is frustrated because the parents don't appreciate the support. \n\nOn one hand, the author is providing for their family, which is commendable, but the parents are disapproving. However, the parents are adults with their own retirement savings. The author is not a child anymore, and their parents' disapproval doesn't necessarily obligate them to keep supporting the parents. \n\nBut the siblings are minors, so the author might be responsible for them. Once the siblings go to college, the parents would be on their own. The author's plan is to stop support when the siblings are no longer dependent. \n\nI think the key points here are: the author is not legally required to support their parents, they're giving them time to move, and the parents are being unappreciative. The author is using their own money to support the family, and the parents are criticizing them. The author's motivation is frustration, not malice. \n\nHowever, some might argue that as a family member, especially one who has already chosen to support them, cutting off ties could be seen as harsh. But the author is not cutting off all contact necessarily, just financial support and kicking them out of their property. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (author not in the wrong) because they are using their own earnings, and the parents have means. But maybe there's a cultural expectation of supporting aging parents, so some might see it as an asshole move. It's a bit of a gray area. The parents might be in the wrong for being ungrateful, but the author's responsibility is debatable. \n\nAlternatively, if the author is the one who initially offered the support, maybe they have a responsibility to continue. But the parents aren't asking for more; they're criticizing the author's life choices. So the author might feel justified in stopping support if it's causing emotional distress. \n\nI think the answer depends on societal views on filial responsibility. In some places, it's expected to support parents, but in others, it's not. Since the author isn't legally required and is giving them time, maybe B is correct. But the emotional aspect of cutting off family could still make some people think the author is wrong. \n\nHmm, but the question is whether the author is the asshole. The parents are being disrespectful, so the author's response is understandable. The answer might be B.\n"
