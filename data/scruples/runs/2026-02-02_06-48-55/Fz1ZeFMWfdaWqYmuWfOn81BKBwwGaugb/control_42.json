Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is 43, their parents are 61 and 65, and they have two siblings aged 17 and 18. The parents don't approve of the author's profession, even though it's bringing in good money. The author is supporting their parents, siblings' education, and their living expenses. However, the parents criticize the author's job every time they visit. The author is planning to cut off financial support and kick the parents out once the siblings go to college, giving them time to find a new place. They argue that the parents don't appreciate the effort and time they put into an easy lifestyle for them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many cultures, children supporting their aging parents is expected, especially if the parents are retired. However, this varies. The author's parents have a retirement fund, so maybe they should be able to support themselves. But the author is providing more than just the retirement fund, covering the entire household expenses. That's a big commitment. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want to support parents who don't appreciate their efforts. It's understandable to feel unappreciated, especially when the criticism is constant. But cutting off support might be seen as harsh. The parents are in their 60s, which is considered old in some cultures, and moving them out could be a significant burden on them. \n\nAlso, the author is supporting their siblings' education and living situation, so maybe they feel stretched thin. But the siblings are still in high school, so once they go to college, the author's responsibility might decrease. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, there's no obligation to support parents unless there's a specific cultural or religious expectation. But morally, it's a gray area. The parents aren't disabled or needing care; they just need housing and expenses covered. The author is giving them a comfortable retirement, but the parents are not grateful. \n\nOn one hand, the author is within their rights to stop supporting them once their siblings are gone. On the other, there's a sense of duty and family responsibility. However, the parents' constant criticism might justify the author's decision. They might feel that their efforts are not appreciated, and continuing to support disapproving parents could be emotionally draining. \n\nBut kicking them out might leave the parents in a difficult situation. Even with ample notice, finding a new place at that age could be challenging. The author might be justified in wanting to set boundaries, especially if the relationship is toxic. However, there's a risk of being seen as selfish if the parents are left without support. \n\nI think it depends on the cultural values one holds. If the community expects adult children to support their parents regardless of the relationship, then the author might be seen as wrong. However, if the emphasis is on mutual respect and appreciation, then the author's actions could be justified. Given the information, the author is making a personal choice to protect their own well-being and set boundaries, which some might support. However, others might argue that cutting off support is harsh, especially considering the parents' age. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is choosing to prioritize their own well-being and the future of their siblings, but it's a nuanced situation where others might have differing opinions.\n"
