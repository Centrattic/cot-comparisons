My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is wrong for planning to kick their parents out of their property. The situation is that the author, who is 43, is supporting their parents and siblings financially. The parents disapprove of their career choice, which the author finds frustrating. They want to stop supporting the parents once their siblings go to college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and legal aspects. In many Western cultures, adult children aren't legally obligated to support their parents unless there's a legal agreement. The author is living separately and paying for the house where the parents and siblings live. So, the author might have the legal right to ask them to leave once the siblings are out. But there's the emotional aspect: the parents are being disrespectful and critical. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want to support people who don't appreciate their efforts. It's understandable that they feel unappreciated. However, cutting off support entirely might be seen as harsh, even if legally justified. The parents have a retirement fund, so they might be able to find another place. But if they're elderly, moving could be difficult. \n\nI should also think about family dynamics. Parents disapproving of their child's career is a common issue, but the author is taking it to the extreme by threatening to remove them from the house. The siblings are being taken care of, which the author sees as their responsibility. The key points here are the author's right to control their property and the parents' right to expect support from their children. \n\nIn many places, children aren't legally required to support parents once they're adults. So, the author has the right to stop financial support. However, the decision to kick out parents might affect the family relationship long-term. The parents might feel abandoned, which could be hurtful. But the author's perspective is that they're not being appreciated and want to set boundaries. \n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, the author might not be in the wrong. Emotionally, it's complex. The answer depends on whether the author is within their rights and if their actions are justified given the circumstances. The user is asking if the author is the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering the author's legal rights and the parents' disapproval not being a legal obligation, the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
