My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for planning to kick their parents out of their property. The author is 43, their parents are 61 and 65. They have a complicated relationship because the parents don't agree with the author's profession. The author supports their siblings' education and living situation, and also pays for their parents' house. They plan to cut off financial support and kick the parents out once the siblings go to college. The parents have a retirement fund but would need to find another place to live.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is providing financially for their parents and siblings. The parents are disapproving, which is causing emotional stress. The author feels unappreciated. But is it wrong to stop supporting parents who are critical? On one hand, the author is taking care of their family's needs, which is commendable. On the other hand, cutting off financial support might be seen as harsh, especially since the parents are elderly.\n\nBut the author mentions giving ample time for the parents to find a new place, so it's not abandoning them. The parents have a retirement fund, which suggests they might have some means. The author is also supporting siblings, which adds complexity. The parents' disapproval is part of the problem, but the author is not forcing them to live there; they're just removing financial support.\n\nLegally, the author owns the property, so they can ask people to leave. Ethically, it's more complex. The author might feel justified due to emotional stress and lack of appreciation. However, some might argue that children have a moral obligation to care for aging parents, regardless of disapproval. But others might say that the author is within their rights to set boundaries, especially if the parents are disrespectful.\n\nThe key points are: financial support, emotional well-being, and the parents' ability to find alternative housing. The author isn't being cruel by giving time to move out, and the parents have a retirement fund. The author's own living situation (living separately) means they aren't directly living with the conflict, but still providing support. \n\nIt's a tough call. If the parents are being abusive or harmful, the author's action might be justified. But here, it's more about disapproval and lack of appreciation. The author's frustration is understandable, but cutting off support could be seen as a consequence of the parents' behavior. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they are choosing to set boundaries and prioritize their own emotional health and support for their siblings. The parents' disapproval isn't justification for abuse, but the author's decision to remove financial support is a personal choice they have the right to make.\n"
