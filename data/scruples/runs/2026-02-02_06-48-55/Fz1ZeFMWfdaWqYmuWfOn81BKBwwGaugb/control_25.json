My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices.

They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to cut off financial support to their parents and kick them out once their siblings go to college. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author is 43, their parents are 61 and 65. The author's job is a source of conflict because the parents disapprove, even though it's well-paid. The author is supporting their siblings' education and living costs, as well as the parents' house. They live separately, so they drop by to check on siblings but get criticized by the parents. The author is frustrated that they work hard for the family's financial well-being, yet the parents don't appreciate it.\n\nThe parents have a retirement fund, so they can afford to look for another place once the siblings leave. The author plans to give them time to find a new home. The key points here are the author's right to their own money and decisions, and the parents' right to their opinions, but the author is providing support while facing disapproval. \n\nFinancial support is a big factor here. In many cultures, it's common for adult children to support aging parents, but there's no legal obligation unless there's a specific agreement. The author is doing this voluntarily, so cutting it off might be seen as their right, especially since the parents are not appreciative. However, the emotional aspect is complex. The parents might feel it's their duty, and the author's decision could be seen as abandonment.\n\nOn the flip side, the author is justified in feeling unappreciated. They are making financial sacrifices for the family, and the parents' disapproval adds to their stress. The author's plan to stop support once the siblings are in college could be seen as a reasonable boundary, especially if the parents are not grateful. The fact that the parents have a retirement fund suggests they can manage without the author's support, which might mitigate some criticism.\n\nBut then, what about the cultural or social expectations? In some societies, there's a strong emphasis on filial piety, expecting children to care for their parents regardless of the parents' behavior. However, in other contexts, personal freedom and choice take precedence. The author is not legally obligated to support their parents, so it's their choice. However, cutting off support entirely might be seen as harsh, even if it's their right.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' role. They have already raised their children, and while they might disapprove of the author's career, they might not have the right to criticize them for it, especially since it's the author's life. The author is also supporting siblings, which adds another layer. The parents might not be considering the impact of their disapproval on the author and the younger siblings.\n\nBut then, the author is using their own money, which they earned through their profession. They have the right to decide how to use it. The parents are not entitled to it unless there's a legal obligation. So, from a legal and ethical standpoint, the author might not be in the wrong. However, emotionally, it's a tough situation. The parents might feel betrayed, but the author is setting boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context of their culture, the specific circumstances, and the dynamics of their family. The author has the right to their money and their decisions, and if the parents are not appreciative, it's reasonable to stop financial support. So the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
