My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for planning to kick their parents out of their property. The key points here are the family dynamics, financial support, and the reasons behind the decision.\n\nFirst, the author is 43, supporting their parents and siblings financially. The parents disapprove of their profession, which makes the author frustrated. The author feels they work hard to provide for everyone but get no appreciation. They plan to cut off financial support and ask their parents to leave once the siblings go to college, giving them time to find another place.\n\nI need to consider cultural expectations. In many cultures, especially collectivist ones, supporting aging parents is a norm. But the author is providing already, and the parents aren't appreciative. The author might feel their efforts are unappreciated, leading to resentment.\n\nIs it wrong to withdraw support if they're not appreciated? Legally, if the parents aren't tenants and it's the author's property, they can ask them to leave. But morally, it's tricky. The parents have a retirement fund, so maybe they can manage. The author also supports siblings, so cutting parents off might be a way to prioritize their own family's future.\n\nHowever, family relationships are complex. Cutting off might be seen as harsh, especially if the parents are elderly. The author's frustration is valid, but the method of resolving it by eviction could be seen as extreme. There's no mention of trying to reconcile or set boundaries first. The author might be acting out of hurt and a desire for respect, but the action could have long-term consequences on family relationships.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a judgment call. If the parents are ungrateful and the author feels exploited, some might say they're justified. But others might argue that cutting off parents entirely is harsh, regardless of the reasons. The key factors here are the author's right to their property and the parents' ability to find alternative housing. If the author provides ample notice and the parents aren't left homeless, maybe it's a reasonable decision. But the emotional aspect of the relationship isn't just about money. However, based on the information given, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, as they have the financial means and property rights. So the answer might be B.\n"
