My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick their parents out of their property. The situation is that the author is paying for everything in the house where their parents and siblings live. The parents disapprove of the author's job, which the author is using to support the siblings and the parents. The author wants to cut off financial support and make the parents leave once the siblings go to college, giving them time to find a new place.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context here. In many cultures, especially in some Asian or traditional societies, supporting one's parents is a significant responsibility. However, the author is in a situation where their parents are being disrespectful and unappreciative, which is causing frustration. The author is already providing for their siblings and parents, but the parents don't appreciate it, leading to a breakdown in the relationship.\n\nIs the author obligated to continue supporting their parents despite the lack of appreciation? That's a key question. Legally, in many places, children aren't required to support their parents unless there's a specific agreement or dependency. Emotionally and morally, it's more subjective. The parents might not be fulfilling their role as supportive figures, which could justify the author's decision in their own eyes. But from a societal standpoint, cutting off support might be seen as harsh, especially if the parents are elderly and dependent.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' retirement fund. The author mentions that the parents have a retirement fund, so they're not destitute. The author also plans to give them time to find a new place, which is a humane approach. However, the parents might not have considered that the author's financial support was part of their retirement plan, which could lead to conflict.\n\nThe author's main issue is the lack of appreciation and the constant criticism. The parents' disapproval is affecting the author's well-being. It's a matter of whether the author's needs for a respectful and appreciative relationship are valid compared to the societal expectation of supporting parents regardless of personal feelings.\n\nIn some perspectives, the author is justified in prioritizing their own mental health and the well-being of their siblings. By removing the toxic influence of the parents, the author might be creating a better environment post-college. However, others might argue that the author is abandoning their parents in their old age, which could be seen as selfish despite the parents' behavior.\n\nI need to weigh the moral responsibility against the emotional toll. If the parents were abusive or harmful, cutting ties would be more justifiable. Here, it's more about disapproval and lack of appreciation, which is less severe but still hurtful. The author's decision might be seen as a necessary step to protect their own mental health and the family's future, even if it's a difficult choice.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the values one prioritizes. If the emphasis is on familial duty and caring for aging parents, then the author is in the wrong. If the emphasis is on personal well-being and the right to not be disrespected, then the author isn't in the wrong. Given the information, the author's actions are a response to years of disapproval and lack of gratitude, so I lean towards them not being in the wrong.\n"
