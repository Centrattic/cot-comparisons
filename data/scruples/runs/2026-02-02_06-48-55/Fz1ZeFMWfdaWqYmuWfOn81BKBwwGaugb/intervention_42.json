      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone considering kicking their parents out of their property because the parents disapprove of their profession, even though the person is financially supporting them. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 43, their parents are 61 and 65. The parents don't approve of the author's job, which the author says is making them a good amount of money. They use this money to support their siblings' education and living expenses, and also cover the parents' expenses since the parents live in the same house. The author wants to cut off financial support and have the parents leave once the siblings go to college. The author feels frustrated because the parents don't appreciate their efforts.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The options are A for yes (wrong) and B for no (not wrong). \n\nI need to consider cultural norms, family obligations, and personal ethics. In some cultures, adult children are expected to support their aging parents, especially if they live together. However, the author is paying for everything in the house, including the parents and siblings. The parents are being critical of the author's profession, which might be a source of tension. The author is making a choice to stop supporting them when the siblings are no longer in need, which could be seen as cutting off at a certain point.\n\nThe key factors here are mutual respect and the idea of reciprocity. The author is providing financial support, but the parents are disrespectful and unappreciative. If the parents were showing support and respect, the author might continue, but since they are not, the author feels justified in stopping. However, kicking them out might be abrupt, even if time is given. The parents might not have other means, and while the author mentions a retirement fund, it's unclear if that's sufficient or if the parents have other resources.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is making a personal choice about their own property and finances. They have the legal right to decide who lives in their property and how to allocate their money. If the parents are living in the author's property, then the author isn't obligated to let them stay if they don't want to. The disapproval of the profession might be a personal issue, but the financial decision is the author's to make.\n\nBut there's a moral aspect. Many people believe in supporting parents as they age, especially if they're in a difficult situation. The author might be seen as cutting them off without considering their needs, even if the parents are critical. The author's reasoning is that they don't see the point in supporting unappreciative parents, which is a personal boundary. However, some might argue that family obligations shouldn't be conditional on approval or appreciation.\n\nAlso, the author is taking care of their siblings, which is commendable, but the parents' disapproval might also be affecting the children. The siblings might be aware of the parents' criticisms, which could create a hostile environment. The author might be trying to protect their siblings' well-being by distancing from the parents, which adds another layer.\n\nIn terms of 'Would I be the asshole?', it's about societal judgment. If the author is in a position to provide for their family, but the parents are being difficult, some might see the author as justified in setting boundaries. Others might think it's harsh to cut off support once the siblings are out of the picture, regardless of the parents' behavior. The answer would depend on the perspective taken\u2014whether the author is prioritizing their own mental health and the well-being of their siblings by removing the negative influence, or if they're being selfish by not supporting their parents who might be in need.\n\nSo, I need to weigh the legal rights of the author versus the moral obligations. The author's actions are legal if they own the property and can decide who stays. Morally, it's a gray area. The parents might have their own issues, but if they are in a vulnerable position (elderly), the author's decision could be seen as neglectful. However, the author might feel that they've done their part and deserve respect in return.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the answer might depend on the specific circumstances. If the parents are being abusive or disrespectful, then the author's choice to set boundaries is understandable. But if the parents are just disapproving without being cruel, it might be different. The author's statement about the parents \"ragging on my job\" suggests ongoing negative behavior, which could justify the decision.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong could be seen as a family matter with both valid points. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is making a personal decision about their property and finances, especially if the parents were being unkind. However, others might argue A (in the wrong) because of expected family support. The Reddit-style \"Would I be the asshole?\" often hinges on perceived fairness and empathy. If the author is being firm but fair, giving time to move out, and the parents' behavior is the root issue, then B could be the answer.\n"
