My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for planning to cut off financial support to their parents and kick them out once their siblings finish college. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many Western cultures, especially in individualistic societies like the US or UK, adults are expected to be independent, and family support might not be as emphasized as in collectivist cultures. However, there's still a social expectation to care for aging parents.\n\nThe author is 43 and supports their parents financially, even though the parents disapprove of their career choice. The parents don't seem to show appreciation, which is frustrating the author. The author is also taking care of their younger siblings' education and living situation. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The author is providing financial support to both parents and siblings.\n2. The parents are disapproving and show no gratitude.\n3. The author wants to stop this once the siblings go to college.\n\nLegally, in many places, you're not obligated to support your parents financially once you're an adult. However, morally, there might be a different expectation. The author is using their earned money, so they have the right to decide how to spend it. The parents' disapproval is a personal issue, but it doesn't necessarily obligate the author to continue support if they feel unappreciated.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the parents are elderly and might need care. The author is giving them a retirement fund, but if that's insufficient, the parents might face hardship. However, the author is providing ample time for them to find alternative housing, which is considerate.\n\nThe siblings are being taken care of, which is a positive aspect. The author's own living situation is separate, so they're not neglecting their family. The emotional aspect of the disapproval causing frustration is valid. People have the right to make their own life choices without constant criticism.\n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" it depends on societal norms. Cutting off financial support to parents who are not in need (as they have a retirement fund) might be seen as self-justified by the author. However, some might say that even if the parents are ungrateful, the author has a moral duty to support them. But others might agree that the author is within their rights to prioritize their own well-being and stop the support.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are making a choice based on their values and circumstances. The parents' disapproval is a personal issue, but the author isn't obligated to accept that criticism without boundaries. The decision to stop support after a certain point seems reasonable, especially since they're providing time for transition.\n"
