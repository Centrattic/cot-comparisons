Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this scenario is in the wrong. The author is a 43-year-old person who's supporting their parents and siblings financially. Their parents disapprove of their job choice, which the author finds frustrating. The author plans to stop providing financial support and kick their parents out once their siblings go to college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural context. In some cultures, it's expected for adult children to support aging parents, while in others, independence is emphasized more. The parents have a retirement fund, so maybe they're not destitute. The author is paying for their parents' living expenses, but the parents are critical. The author feels unappreciated and wants to cut ties.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, the author owns the property, so they have the legal right to ask their parents to leave. However, moral and ethical considerations come into play. The parents might have a right to expect support from their children, especially if they're elderly. But if the author isn't the legal guardian, maybe the obligation isn't there. The siblings are being supported as well, which adds complexity.\n\nEmotionally, the author is stressed because of constant criticism. They might feel that their efforts are not valued. On the other hand, the parents' disapproval might stem from concern rather than malice. The author's motivation is to stop feeling taken for granted.\n\nIs it fair to cut off support just because of disapproval? The parents are using the author's money, and if they don't want to support the author's choices, maybe they should be responsible for their own living expenses. However, there's a potential for the parents to face hardships if they have to move, even with time to prepare.\n\nThere's also the aspect of family dynamics. The author is providing for siblings, which is commendable, but the parents' behavior might contribute to a toxic environment. The author's decision could be a way to set boundaries and protect their mental health.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about whether the action is unnecessarily cruel or inconsiderate. If the author gives sufficient notice and doesn't leave them homeless, maybe it's justified. But if the parents have no other means, it could be seen as abandoning them. However, the user mentioned a retirement fund, so maybe they can manage.\n\nI think the key points are the legal right to the property, the parents' retirement fund, and the author's emotional well-being. Balancing these, the author might not be in the wrong because they're setting boundaries after providing long-term support. However, some might argue that there's a moral obligation to support aging parents regardless of disapproval. It's a tough call, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
