My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person is 43 and has a complicated relationship with their parents, who disapprove of their profession. The author pays for everything in the house where the parents and siblings live. The parents constantly criticize the author's job, and the author is considering cutting financial support and kicking them out once the siblings go to college. The parents have a retirement fund, so they wouldn't be homeless.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around family responsibilities. In many cultures, supporting aging parents is expected, but it's not universal. The author is providing financial support, which is a big deal. The parents are not appreciative, which is frustrating. However, the author is also supporting their younger siblings, so maybe they feel stretched thin. \n\nThe question is whether cutting off financial support is justified. The parents are in their 60s/70s, and the author is taking a stand against their disapproval. On one hand, the author has the right to their own life choices and shouldn't have to endure constant criticism. On the other hand, the parents might not be in a position to support themselves anymore, even with a retirement fund. \n\nBut the author mentions giving them ample time to find a new place, so it's not immediate. The siblings' education is also a factor here. The author is balancing multiple responsibilities. The key point is whether the author is obligated to continue supporting parents who are unappreciative. If the parents are not dependents in a legal sense, maybe the author isn't wrong to set boundaries. \n\nHowever, in some societies, there's an expectation to care for parents regardless of their behavior. The author's decision might be seen as selfish if the parents have no other means. But if the author is already providing for siblings and the parents are not contributing, perhaps the author is justified in prioritizing their own family's future. \n\nI think the answer hinges on cultural values and the specifics of the situation. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to decide how to allocate their resources, especially if the parents were aware of the conditions beforehand. However, some might argue that the author is abandoning their duty to their parents. But since the parents are not in immediate hardship and have a retirement fund, the author's actions might be seen as reasonable. So I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
