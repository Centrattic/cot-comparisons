My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for planning to kick their parents out of their property. The situation is complicated. The author is 43, supports their parents and siblings financially, but the parents disapprove of their profession. The author is frustrated because the parents don't appreciate the support and they want to cut them off once the siblings go to college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and ethical norms. In some cultures, adult children are expected to support their aging parents, even with disagreements. However, the author is paying for their parents' living expenses, which might be seen as an obligation. But the parents aren't reciprocating with respect or gratitude, which adds to the frustration.\n\nThe author's main point is about respect and appreciation. They feel their efforts are unappreciated, leading to a desire to stop financial support. The parents are in their 60s, have a retirement fund, and would need to find another place to live. The author plans to give them time, so it's not abrupt.\n\nLegally, if the parents are living in the author's property, they might have a right to stay if it's their home too. The author might need to consider legal aspects of evicting family members. Ethically, it's a gray area. The parents might feel entitled to support from their child, especially if it's a cultural expectation. But the author is also taking care of siblings, which could justify their focus on family support.\n\nAnother angle: the parents' disapproval of the profession could be a source of tension. The author might feel they deserve respect for their choices, especially since it's financially successful. However, cutting off financial support is a significant decision. The siblings' education and living situation are also a priority, which the author is handling.\n\nPotential arguments against the author: They might be seen as abandoning their parents who are in their retirement age. Even if the parents have a retirement fund, moving might be difficult for them. The author could be perceived as prioritizing their own feelings over their parents' well-being.\n\nArguments for the author: They are providing support without receiving respect in return. The financial burden might be overwhelming, and cutting off support could be a way to set boundaries. Since the parents have a retirement fund, they have a safety net. The author is also considering the siblings' future, which might be more critical.\n\nI should also think about the concept of filial responsibility. In some societies, children are expected to care for their parents, but in others, independence is emphasized. The key here is that the author is doing this for their siblings as well, which complicates the dynamic. The parents might have obligations to their children beyond just financial support, like emotional support, which they're not providing.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a tough call. The author has valid reasons for feeling unappreciated and wanting to focus on their siblings. However, the decision to kick out parents might be seen as harsh, especially if there's an expectation of lifelong support. The answer might hinge on cultural context and the specific circumstances of the family's agreement. Since the author is planning to give time for the parents to move out, it's more of a structured transition rather than an abrupt eviction. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but it's a complex situation.\n"
