They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is 43, paying for their parents and siblings' living expenses. The parents disapprove of the author's profession, which makes them a good amount of money. The author plans to cut off financial support and kick out their parents once the siblings go to college. The author feels their parents don't appreciate their efforts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many cultures, adult children supporting aging parents is common, but it's not a universal expectation. The author is providing for their parents and siblings, which might be seen as a financial responsibility. However, the parents are openly disapproving of the author's career choice, which causes frustration.\n\nThe key points here are: the author is financially supporting the household, the parents are being critical, and the author wants to stop supporting them once the siblings are in college. The parents have a retirement fund, so the author isn't leaving them without any resources. The author is giving them time to find another place. \n\nNow, the question is whether this is justified. Legally, in many places, there's no obligation for adult children to support their parents unless there's a court order or specific legal context. So from a legal standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong. But morally or socially? That's trickier. \n\nSocially, there might be expectations of filial piety in some cultures, but others might prioritize individual choice and personal boundaries. The author is taking care of their siblings' education and living situation, which is commendable. However, the parents are not appreciative and are critical, which adds to the author's stress. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't see the point in supporting people who don't appreciate their efforts. That's understandable. But some might argue that parents have a right to support, regardless of their feelings. However, if the parents have a retirement fund, maybe they can support themselves. \n\nThe siblings are being taken care of, which might be the author's primary responsibility. The parents' disapproval is a personal conflict, and the author is setting boundaries. Cutting off financial support could be seen as a necessary step to protect their own resources and mental health. \n\nBut some people might say that the parents, despite their disapproval, have a right to care from their children. But again, if there's a retirement fund, maybe the author isn't obligated. The author is also living separately, so they aren't living with the parents, which might reduce their responsibility. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions could be seen as justified because they are not legally required to support their parents, they have provided them with a comfortable lifestyle, and the parents are not appreciative. The author is also ensuring the siblings' future. So, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
