My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is 43, is considering cutting off financial support for their parents once their siblings go to college. The parents don't approve of the author's profession and are critical of them during visits. The author provides for the entire household, including the parents and siblings, and wants to stop funding their parents' living expenses once the siblings are in college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is supporting their parents financially despite the parents' disapproval and criticism. The author feels unappreciated and frustrated. The parents have a retirement fund, so they aren't completely without resources. The author plans to give them time to find another place, so they're not being evicted immediately.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the author owns the property and the parents are living there, the author might have the right to ask them to leave. However, family dynamics complicate things. The parents are being critical, which could affect the author's mental health and relationships. The author is taking care of their siblings' education and living situation, which shows responsibility. But cutting off financial support for the parents after years of providing it might be seen as a sudden shift, especially if the parents rely on it.\n\nCulturally, in many societies, children supporting aging parents is expected, but it's also a personal choice. The author might feel that the lack of appreciation justifies stopping support. However, some might argue that financial support is a separate issue from personal approval. The parents' disapproval could be a communication issue rather than a justification for cutting them off.\n\nThe siblings are young, so the author's support now is crucial for their future. Once they're in college, the author might feel less obligated to support the parents, especially if the parents were not supportive. But the author's decision to kick them out might be seen as harsh, even if they have a retirement fund. The parents might need more time to adjust, and the author's plan gives them ample time, which is considerate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is entitled to their own decisions and should not have to endure constant criticism for their career choice. The emotional toll of being criticized despite providing for the family is significant. The author might feel that they deserve respect and appreciation for their contributions.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, is the author in the wrong? If the parents are ungrateful and critical, the author might feel justified. But if the author is cutting off support solely because of disapproval, that could be seen as not being supportive of their parents. However, since the parents have a retirement fund, it's not like they're left with nothing. The author might be making a difficult but reasonable decision to prioritize their own well-being and focus on their siblings' future.\n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is making a choice to stop supporting parents who are unappreciative and critical, especially since they have a retirement fund. The author is also ensuring their siblings' future, which shows they are responsible. The decision, while harsh, might be justified given the circumstances.\n"
