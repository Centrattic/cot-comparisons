My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for planning to cut off financial support and kick their parents out of their property. The author is 43, supports their parents and siblings financially, but the parents disapprove of their career choice and often criticize them during visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal norms. In many cultures, supporting aging parents is seen as a responsibility, especially if they have no other means. The author mentions that their parents have a retirement fund, so maybe they aren't destitute. But the parents might still rely on that financial support. The author wants to stop supporting them once the siblings go to college. That's a significant decision.\n\nNext, the parents' behavior. They continuously criticize the author's job, which leads to frustration. The author feels unappreciated despite working hard. There's a conflict between the author's choices and their parents' approval. Legally, if the parents are living in the author's property, the author might have the right to ask them to leave, depending on local laws. But emotionally and ethically, it's complicated.\n\nThe author's main points: they support their siblings, pay for the parents' house, but the parents don't appreciate it. The author is cutting off support because of lack of appreciation. The parents have a retirement fund but might need to find another place. The author gives ample time for them to move, which is considerate. However, cutting them off entirely could leave them without support if their retirement isn't enough.\n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The author isn't obligated to support their parents if they have no legal or cultural duty. However, if the parents are dependent, cutting them off could be seen as harsh. The author's intention is to stop supporting those who don't appreciate their efforts. The siblings are also part of the equation, and the author is providing for them, which might mitigate some criticism.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, it's about intent and impact. The author's intent is self-preservation and boundary-setting, which is understandable. The impact could be significant on the parents, but they have a retirement fund. If the parents are not in immediate danger, the author's decision might be justified. However, the lack of appreciation from the parents is a key factor. The author might feel they're being fair, but others might see it as abandoning family in need.\n\nLegally, if the parents are living in the author's property as tenants, the author can ask them to leave with proper notice. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The answer might depend on the balance between personal boundaries and family responsibility. Since the author provides for their siblings and has a valid reason for frustration, the decision might be seen as justified, making the answer B (not in the wrong). But there's a chance others might argue A (in the wrong) due to familial obligations. However, given the details, B seems more appropriate.\n"
