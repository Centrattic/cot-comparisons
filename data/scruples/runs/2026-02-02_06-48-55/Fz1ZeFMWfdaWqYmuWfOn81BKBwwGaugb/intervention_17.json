My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for planning to kick their parents out of their property. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 43, their parents are 61 and 65. The parents disapprove of the author's profession, which generates good income. The author supports their parents and siblings financially. They live separately from their parents and siblings. When they visit, the parents criticize their job. The author plans to cut off financial support once the siblings go to college, giving the parents time to find another place to live.\n\nHmm. The parents have a retirement fund, but they might need to find another home. The author feels unappreciated and frustrated. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider cultural expectations, family dynamics, and the legal aspects. In many cultures, adult children supporting aging parents is expected, especially if the parents are financially dependent. However, there's also the aspect of respect and consideration. The parents criticize the author's profession, which is a personal choice. The author is providing for them, but they don't show appreciation.\n\nBut the author is also supporting siblings. If the parents are being disrespectful, maybe the author has the right to set boundaries. However, cutting them off completely might be seen as harsh, especially if the parents are elderly and might have limited options. But the author mentions giving them time, which is thoughtful.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the author could try to have a conversation with the parents to set boundaries without eviction. However, the author might feel that they've already tried and it's not working. The key point is whether the author is obligated to support parents who are unappreciative and critical.\n\nLegally, in many places, there's no obligation to support parents unless there's a court order. But culturally, it's more complex. Some might argue that the author is not obligated and has the right to stop support if they feel disrespected. Others might say that parents deserve support regardless of their behavior.\n\nSo, the answer depends on the balance between the author's rights to live their life without criticism and the traditional expectation to care for aging parents. Since the parents have a retirement fund, maybe they can manage on their own. The author is providing a safety net, but once the siblings are independent, the author might not feel responsible anymore.\n\nI think the author is not necessarily in the wrong because they are setting boundaries to protect their own well-being. However, there's a cultural aspect where some might criticize for not being considerate enough. But since they are giving time and the parents have resources, it's a valid decision.\n"
