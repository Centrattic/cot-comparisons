My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for planning to kick their parents out of their property. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is 43, their parents are 61 and 65. The parents disapprove of the author's profession, which the author makes good money from. The author uses this money to support their parents and siblings. However, the parents criticize the author's job and choices during visits. The author plans to cut off financial support once their siblings go to college and make their parents leave.\n\nThe key points here are the financial support, the parents' disapproval, and the author's decision to stop supporting them. The author feels unappreciated and is frustrated with the constant criticism. They argue that they're providing for their parents despite the disapproval, but when it comes time for the siblings to go to college, they want to stop.\n\nFirst, I should consider cultural norms. In many cultures, supporting aging parents is seen as a responsibility, even if the relationship is strained. However, the author is also supporting their siblings, and perhaps the parents aren't contributing to the household since the author pays for everything. The parents might not be pulling their weight, which could justify the author's decision.\n\nBut then again, the parents are in their 60s and might not have many years left to work. If they lose their current living situation, they might struggle to find another place, especially if their retirement funds aren't sufficient. The author mentions giving them time to find a new place, which is a consideration, but it's still a significant life change for the parents.\n\nThe author's motivation is feeling unappreciated. The parents' disapproval is causing frustration. However, cutting them off completely might be seen as harsh, especially if they have no other means. On the other hand, if the parents are not contributing and are only a source of stress, maybe it's a reasonable decision for the author's peace of mind.\n\nAnother angle: the author is paying for everything, which could create a power imbalance. The parents might feel they have no choice but to stay, and their criticism might be a form of expressing dissatisfaction. But the author feels they deserve appreciation and the right to live without constant criticism.\n\nLegally, if the parents are living in the author's property, the author has the right to ask them to leave once certain conditions are met (like giving notice). But morally, it's more complex. It depends on the societal expectations of family responsibility versus personal boundaries.\n\nIn some perspectives, the author is within their rights to stop supporting those who don't respect their choices. In others, family obligations might override personal grievances. The fact that the author is also supporting siblings complicates things, but the siblings are minors, so the author might have a legal responsibility there as well.\n\nI need to weigh the author's right to their own happiness and financial decisions against the parents' situation. If the parents have a retirement fund, maybe they can manage, but if not, the author might be abandoning them. Also, the author's relationship with their parents is complicated, and cutting them off could have long-term consequences, like affecting their relationship with the siblings later on.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid reasons for feeling unappreciated and might have the right to stop supporting their parents, the decision could be seen as harsh depending on the parents' financial situation and cultural expectations. However, the author is not necessarily in the wrong if they believe they have fulfilled their obligations and want to set boundaries.\n"
