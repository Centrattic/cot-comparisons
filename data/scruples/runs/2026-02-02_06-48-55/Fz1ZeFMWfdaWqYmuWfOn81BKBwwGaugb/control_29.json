My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for planning to kick their parents out of their property once their siblings go to college. The parents don't approve of the author's profession, which is making them money to support the family. The parents live with the siblings, and whenever the author visits, the parents criticize their job choices. The author is frustrated and wants to cut them off financially and have them move out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms and family expectations. In many cultures, especially in more traditional ones, family members are expected to support each other regardless of disagreements. However, the author is paying for everything, including the parents' living expenses, which might create a power dynamic where the parents are dependent on the author's income. If the parents are critical and unappreciative, the author's decision to stop supporting them might be seen as a way to set boundaries.\n\nAnother angle is legal ownership. The author mentions they live separately and pay for the house. If the house is in the author's name, they might have the legal right to ask their parents to leave. However, if the parents are tenants, there might be notice periods or other legal considerations. The author says they'll give ample time, so legally they might be in the right.\n\nEmotionally, the parents might feel they are being abandoned, but the author is prioritizing their own well-being and possibly their siblings' future. The siblings are being supported, which is a key point. The author is taking care of their educational and living expenses, which is a significant responsibility.\n\nThe parents' disapproval of the profession could be a generational or cultural issue. The author is making a good income, so the criticism is about lifestyle or career choice, not financial irresponsibility. The frustration comes from lack of appreciation despite the efforts made.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. If the parents are living in the author's property and being ungrateful, the author has a right to decide their own living arrangements. However, in some cultures, cutting off support for parents is seen as disrespectful. But the author is not cutting off all support; they mention the parents have a retirement fund. The author is giving them time to find another place, which is considerate.\n\nThe siblings are being taken care of, so the author isn't abandoning them. The decision is made after the siblings leave for college, which is a reasonable time to reassess support for the parents. The parents might need to find their own living situation, but the author isn't putting them on the streets immediately.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is setting boundaries to protect their mental health and possibly their own financial resources. They are not neglecting their responsibilities to the siblings but are addressing the emotional toll from the parents' criticism. It's a balance between duty to family and personal well-being.\n\nSo, the key points are legal rights, cultural expectations, emotional impact, and the author's right to personal financial decisions. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions are seen as justified in setting boundaries despite the parents' disapproval. From a modern perspective, especially in individualistic societies, the author might not be in the wrong. However, in collectivist cultures, it might be seen as a betrayal. Since the question doesn't specify the cultural context, but the scenario is presented in a way that emphasizes the author's efforts and the parents' ingratitude, the answer leaning towards B (author not in the wrong) seems plausible.\n"
