      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for planning to kick their parents out of their property. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is 43, and their parents are 61 and 65. The parents disapprove of the author's profession, even though it's a good money-maker. The author uses this income to support their two siblings' education and living expenses, as well as the family home where the parents and siblings live. The author lives separately. The problem is that the parents constantly criticize the author's job when they visit, leading to frustration. The author plans to stop financial support and evict the parents once the siblings go to college, giving them time to find another place.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is the asshole (A) or not (B). \n\nI should consider cultural context. In many cultures, especially traditional ones, children are expected to support their aging parents. However, this varies. The author mentions that the parents have a retirement fund, so maybe they have some resources. But the author is paying for the house and other expenses, which might be beyond just retirement savings.\n\nLegal aspect: If the parents are living in the author's property, the author owns it. Legally, they might have the right to ask them to leave, especially if it's private property. However, there might be legal obligations in some places regarding supporting parents, but that's rare. Usually, parents support children, not the other way around unless there's a specific legal duty, which is uncommon.\n\nEmotional aspect: The parents' disapproval is causing the author stress. The author feels unappreciated. The parents might not realize how their criticism affects the author. However, the author's response is to cut off support and kick them out, which could be seen as harsh, especially since the parents are elderly.\n\nEthical considerations: Is it right to cut off support because of disapproval? The author's profession is their choice, and while the parents might disapprove, the author's financial success allows them to support their family. The author is also supporting their siblings, which shows responsibility. But the parents are in a position where they might need support as they age.\n\nPotential consequences: Evicting the parents could leave them without housing, even if the author gives time to find a place. The parents might struggle, especially if their retirement funds are insufficient. The siblings are still in school, and the author is paying for their education, so maybe after they leave, the author's financial burden lessens, but the parents would still need housing.\n\nMoral judgment: The author's actions are a personal choice, but the question is whether it's wrong. If the parents aren't contributing to the household and are causing emotional harm, maybe the author has a right to prioritize their own well-being. However, if the parents are dependent on the author's support, there's an argument that the author has a moral obligation to care for them, especially given their age.\n\nCultural expectations: In some cultures, adult children are expected to support their parents, but in others, independence is valued more. The author's stance might be more acceptable in a culture that emphasizes individualism over collectivism.\n\nThe key points are whether the author is legally required to support their parents (probably not), the emotional dynamics, and the parents' financial situation. Since the author mentions the parents have a retirement fund, maybe they can manage without the author's support. However, the author's frustration is valid if they feel unappreciated despite providing for their family.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision is a personal one. Legally, they might have the right to evict their parents. Ethically, it's more complex. If the parents are using the author's resources without gratitude and causing conflict, the author might not be in the wrong. However, if the parents are elderly and truly need support, cutting them off could be seen as harsh. The answer might hinge on the specific circumstances and cultural norms, but based on the information given, the author's actions might be justified as they are prioritizing their own well-being and the siblings' future.\n"
