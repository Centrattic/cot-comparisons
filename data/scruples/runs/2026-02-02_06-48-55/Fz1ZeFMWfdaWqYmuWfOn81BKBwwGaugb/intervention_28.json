My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for planning to kick their parents out after college. The author pays for everything the parents and siblings share. They live separately. The parents disapprove of their profession, which the author says is making them good money. The author supports their siblings' education and living expenses, and also their parents' living expenses. They plan to stop financial support once the siblings go to college and ask if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, adult children support aging parents, but in others, independence is expected. The author is providing for their parents, but the parents don't appreciate it. The author feels frustrated because their efforts are not valued. The parents' disapproval of their job adds to the tension.\n\nThe parents have a retirement fund, so they can afford to move. But cutting off financial support might be a way to enforce boundaries. The author is also supporting siblings, which is commendable. The siblings are 17 and 18, so in a couple of years they'll be in college. After that, the author plans to stop supporting the parents.\n\nThe key points are: the author is financially supporting the parents against their disapproval, but the parents don't appreciate it. The author feels they're doing this without gratitude. The parents aren't in a dire situation since they have a retirement fund. The author is not forcing them out immediately but giving time to move. So the author is making a decision to stop support after a certain period, which could be seen as reasonable if the parents are able to live independently.\n\nHowever, the emotional aspect is important. The parents might have health issues or other needs as they age. The author might be making a choice that could lead to the parents facing financial difficulties later. Also, cutting off support abruptly after years of providing it might be seen as harsh, even if they have a retirement fund.\n\nBut the author is setting boundaries, which is their right. They might feel that their efforts are not appreciated, and they deserve to stop supporting people who criticize them. The parents' disapproval could be causing emotional distress. The author's decision to focus on their own life after supporting siblings is understandable.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If the parents are capable of living independently and the author is setting boundaries after years of support, maybe not. But if the parents need the support and the author is cutting them off without considering their needs, then maybe yes. The parents have a retirement fund, so perhaps they can manage. The author is giving time to move, which is considerate. The main conflict is the disapproval and lack of gratitude.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is making a choice that prioritizes their own well-being and boundaries, which is valid. They are not the asshole if they are providing for their siblings and giving the parents time to adjust. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But there's nuance here. The parents might not be in immediate danger, so the author is justified in stopping support. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
