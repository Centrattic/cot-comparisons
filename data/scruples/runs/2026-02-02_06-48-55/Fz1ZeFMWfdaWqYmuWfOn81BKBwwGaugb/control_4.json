My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering kicking their parents out of their property. The key points here are the relationship dynamics, financial responsibilities, and the parents' disapproval.\n\nFirst, the author is 43, their parents are 61 and 65. The parents disapprove of the author's profession, which makes them a good amount of money. This money is used to support the author's siblings' education and living costs, as well as their parents' expenses. The author lives separately but covers everything for the household where their parents and siblings live. The parents are critical of the author's career choice each time they visit, leading to frustration. The author plans to cut off financial support and evict them once the siblings go to college, giving them time to find a new place.\n\nNow, considering cultural and legal aspects: In many Western societies, adult children aren't legally obligated to support their parents unless there are specific laws (like in some EU countries). However, this varies by country. The author isn't forced to support their parents; they choose to do so. The parents have their own retirement funds, so they aren't impoverished.\n\nEmotionally, the author feels unappreciated. The parents' disapproval is a significant stressor. Cutting off support might be a way to set boundaries. But is it wrong? The parents are using the author's resources to live comfortably. If the author feels this is unfair, especially with the ongoing criticism, then it's a personal decision. However, societal norms might view supporting aging parents as expected, but that's not a legal requirement here. The author's reasoning is based on personal values and the lack of appreciation. The siblings' needs are also a factor, but since they're minors, the author's responsibility to them is higher. Once they're in college, that responsibility shifts, perhaps making the author's plan more understandable.\n\nThe parents have a retirement fund, so they can move. The author is giving them time, so it's not abrupt. The conflict is about respect and gratitude. If the parents are ungrateful, the author's decision might be seen as justified. However, some might argue that cutting off support is harsh, but others would support the author's right to choose how to spend their money.\n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" it's subjective. The author is standing up for their own boundaries after years of support and criticism. The parents are using the author's resources without mutual respect. The answer likely hinges on whether financial support should be conditional on parental approval. If the author is providing out of obligation without reciprocity, then cutting off support isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer would be B: No.\n"
