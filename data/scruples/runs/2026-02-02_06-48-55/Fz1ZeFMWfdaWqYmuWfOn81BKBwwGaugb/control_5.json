My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong for kicking their parents out of their property. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 43, their parents are 61 and 65. The parents disapprove of the author's profession, which is financially successful and allows them to support their siblings and parents. The author lives separately but pays for everything the parents and siblings use. The parents criticize the author whenever they visit, and the author is frustrated because they feel unappreciated. The author plans to cut off financial support and kick the parents out once the siblings go to college, giving them time to find a new place.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, if the property is owned by the author, they have the right to decide who lives there. So, kicking them out might be legal. But morally or ethically? The parents are in their 60s, so finding new housing might be challenging. The author is providing for them, but the parents are critical. The author feels unappreciated and is using the money they earn from a job they're told is controversial. \n\nCultural context could matter. In some cultures, supporting aging parents is expected. However, the author is already doing so, and the disapproval is adding to the stress. The parents are not contributing to the household, so the author isn't being exploited. The key factors are: the author's right to their property, the parents' disapproval, and the author's frustration with lack of appreciation. \n\nThe author is not forcing the parents to stay; they are choosing to support them despite criticism. The decision to stop support when the siblings leave might be seen as self-respecting, as the author is prioritizing their own well-being. However, some might argue that the parents are in a vulnerable position and the author has a responsibility. But since the author is not legally obligated to support them (assuming they're adults), it's more of a personal choice. \n\nIn terms of being an \"asshole,\" the author is acting in their own interest after years of disapproval and lack of gratitude. The parents' behavior is contributing to the author's decision. The author is giving them time to move out, which is considerate. So, the author isn't being malicious but is setting boundaries. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their property and choices. The answer should be B.\n"
