Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is 43 and has a complicated relationship with their parents, who disapprove of their profession. The parents are 61 and 65, and the author supports them financially along with two siblings. The author is considering cutting off financial support and kicking the parents out once the siblings go to college.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspect. In many places, adult children aren't legally obligated to support their parents unless there's a court order or specific laws in their jurisdiction. However, the author is choosing to do this voluntarily. The parents might have their own retirement funds, but if they're not sufficient, the author's decision could affect their living situation. But the author says they'll give ample time for the parents to find a new place, which is probably a responsible approach.\n\nNext, the emotional aspect. The parents are disapproving of the author's career, which seems to be making them good money. The author feels frustrated because their efforts aren't appreciated. It's understandable that someone would feel resentful if their contributions aren't acknowledged, especially when there's a history of disapproval. However, family dynamics can be complex. The author is also supporting their siblings, which adds to the pressure.\n\nEthically, is it wrong to stop supporting parents who are being critical? Some might argue that the author has a moral obligation to care for their parents, especially since they're elderly. Others might say that the author has the right to stop supporting them if there's no reciprocity or respect. The fact that the author is providing for siblings complicates things further, as it shows a sense of responsibility but also highlights the burden they're carrying.\n\nCultural factors might play a role here. In some cultures, filial piety is highly valued, and cutting off support could be seen as disrespectful. In more individualistic societies, personal choice and self-respect might be prioritized. The author's decision could be viewed through these lenses differently depending on cultural norms.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons for the decision: lack of appreciation and disapproval of their career. The parents' disapproval isn't just minor criticism\u2014they're \"ragging on\" the author's job every time they visit. This constant negativity could be contributing to the author's frustration. The author is also ensuring that the parents have time to find alternative housing, which shows they're not being cruel or abrupt.\n\nHowever, it's important to consider if there's a middle ground. Could the author have tried other ways to address the disapproval and lack of appreciation before taking this drastic step? Maybe setting boundaries, having a direct conversation with the parents, or seeking family therapy. But if those options have been exhausted and the parents continue their behavior, then the author's decision might be justified.\n\nIn terms of the siblings, the author is supporting them, which is a positive. But if the parents are being kicked out, the siblings might be affected. The author might need to consider how this decision impacts the siblings' living situation once they go to college, especially if the parents are no longer there to provide support.\n\nOverall, the situation is complex. The author is making a tough choice based on their experiences and the lack of support from their parents. While some might criticize the decision as harsh, others might see it as necessary for the author's well-being and autonomy. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions are seen as a reasonable response to years of disapproval and lack of appreciation or as an abandonment of familial duty.\n"
