Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering kicking their parents out. The situation is complicated. The author is 43, their parents are 61 and 65. The parents disapprove of the author's profession, which brings in good money. The author supports their siblings' education and living expenses and also pays for their parents' house. They live separately. Every time they visit, the parents criticize their job choices. The author plans to cut financial support once the siblings go to college, giving the parents time to find a new place. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is providing financial support for their parents, siblings, and the parents' house. The parents are disapproving and critical. The author feels unappreciated. They want to stop supporting the parents after the siblings leave. The parents have a retirement fund but would need to move.\n\nLegally, in many places, adult children aren't obligated to support their parents unless there's a specific legal duty, like if they're the legal guardian. But culturally, this varies. In some cultures, supporting aging parents is expected. However, the author is doing so voluntarily, not out of obligation. The parents are using the author's money without appreciation, which is causing emotional distress.\n\nThe author is also supporting their siblings, which shows they care for their family. The parents' criticism is ongoing, which adds to the frustration. The author's plan is to stop support after a certain point, giving the parents time to adjust. It's not immediate eviction; they'd have time to find another home.\n\nNow, is this wrong? Well, the author isn't legally required to support them. They are making a choice to do so out of their own means. If the parents are not appreciative and the criticism is harmful, then the author might have a valid reason to stop. However, there's a cultural expectation in many societies to care for aging parents. The author might be cutting off support due to personal boundaries, which is their right. But the act of \"kicking them out\" could be seen as harsh, even if given time to move. The siblings are being looked after, so the author isn't abandoning them entirely.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might feel they have a right to support from their child, especially if they're elderly. The author could be seen as not fulfilling familial duties. But if the parents are ungrateful and the author is experiencing emotional stress, their decision is more about self-preservation and setting boundaries.\n\nThe key here is whether the parents are dependent on the author's support. If they have a retirement fund but are still relying on the author's money, maybe they should have planned better. The author's reasoning is that they don't want to support people who don't appreciate their efforts. This is a common dilemma in family dynamics where expectations clash.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, it's tricky. The author isn't doing anything illegal, but the question is about being an asshole. If the author is providing support voluntarily and then decides to stop, especially if the parents are being difficult, it's debatable. The author might be justified in setting boundaries after contributing so much. However, the parents might see it as neglect. The answer would depend on cultural norms and individual perspectives. But since the author is paying for everything and the parents are not appreciative, it's more about the author protecting their own well-being. So, the answer might be B (Not the asshole).\n"
