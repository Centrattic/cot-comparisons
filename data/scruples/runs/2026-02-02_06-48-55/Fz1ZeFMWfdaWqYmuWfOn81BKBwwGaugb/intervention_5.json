My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick their parents out of their property. The situation is that the author is 43, supports their parents and siblings financially, but the parents don't approve of their job. The author is frustrated because the parents don't appreciate the support and wants to cut them off when the siblings go to college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and legal aspects. In many cultures, adult children supporting aging parents can be a norm, but it's not a legal requirement unless there are specific obligations. The author is paying for the house and everything else, but the parents are being negative. The question is whether cutting them off is justified.\n\nEthically, some might argue that the parents are ungrateful, so the author is within their rights to stop supporting them. Others might think that family obligations are important regardless of the parents' behavior. Also, the author is providing for siblings' education and living situation, so maybe they feel it's a burden. However, the parents have a retirement fund, so they might be able to find other housing.\n\nLegally, if the author owns the property, they can decide who lives there. So kicking them out isn't illegal. But the moral aspect is trickier. The parents might have emotional needs, and the author's decision could be seen as cutting them off entirely. On the other hand, the author is entitled to their own life and might feel unappreciated.\n\nThe key points are: the author is providing support, the parents are disapproving, and the author wants to stop. The answer depends on whether the author is morally obligated to continue supporting ungrateful parents. If the decision is based on the parents' lack of appreciation and the author's right to live without constant criticism, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author is prioritizing their own needs over their parents' well-being, some might see it as harsh. \n\nI think there's a balance here. The author is making a personal choice that's within their rights, but whether it's morally right is subjective. Since the question is about being an asshole, if the author is justifying it by their own terms and not being cruel beyond giving time to move out, maybe they aren't the asshole. But others might argue that family should be supported regardless. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they have the right to their property and their decision is based on their own values.\n"
