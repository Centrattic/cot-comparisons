My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for planning to kick their parents out of their property and cut them off financially. The author is 43, supports their parents and siblings, and feels unappreciated because their parents criticize their profession. The parents are 61 and 65, have a retirement fund, and the siblings will be going to college.\n\nFirst, the author is providing financial support to their parents and siblings, which is significant. The parents aren't paying rent, so it's unclear if the author owns the property or if the parents are living there legally. If the author owns the property, they have the legal right to ask their parents to leave, especially if the parents are not on the lease or title. However, morally, it's a different question. The parents are elderly and have a retirement fund, but cutting them off entirely could leave them in a difficult situation, even if they have some financial resources.\n\nThe author's motivation is frustration over lack of appreciation and criticism. But the parents might have their own reasons for disapproving the profession, which might not be about the author's worth but their own values. The author is using the siblings' education and living expenses as justification for supporting the parents, but once the siblings are in college, the author plans to cut support. This could be seen as a strategic move rather than purely altruistic.\n\nEthically, while the author has legal rights, the decision to remove family members from their home and stop financial support could be seen as harsh, especially considering the parents' age and the fact that they have a retirement fund but might not be prepared for other living arrangements. The author's reasoning is based on the idea that support is conditional on appreciation, which may not be a universally accepted standard. However, the author is also prioritizing their own emotional well-being, which is understandable.\n\nThe key points here are the legal rights, the moral implications of using financial support as leverage, and the potential consequences for the parents. If the author legally owns the property and has the right to remove them, then from a legal standpoint, they aren't wrong. Morally, it's more complex. Some might argue that the author is justified in setting boundaries after providing support, while others might see it as abandoning responsibility towards aging parents.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on whether the author has the legal right to do this and the ethical perspective taken. Since the question is whether the author is \"in the wrong,\" if they have the legal right, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). However, if the situation is more about moral obligation and family responsibility, then A (in the wrong) could be the answer. The original poster's own thought is that the author is in the wrong, so considering that, but also the legal aspect, the answer might be B if legal rights are in place. But the moral answer is less clear. However, since the user is asking for a definitive answer, I need to choose between A and B based on the scenario provided.\n"
