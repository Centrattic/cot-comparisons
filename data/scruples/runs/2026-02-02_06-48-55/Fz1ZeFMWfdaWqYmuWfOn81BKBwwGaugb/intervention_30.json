My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The author is 43 and wants to kick their parents out of their property because the parents disapprove of their job, even though the author supports their siblings and parents financially. The parents don't appreciate it and criticize them whenever they visit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around family responsibilities. In many countries, adult children might be expected to support aging parents, but this varies. The parents here have their own retirement fund, so maybe they aren't destitute. The author is paying for their house and the siblings, which is a significant contribution. But the parents aren't showing gratitude and are being critical.\n\nEmotionally, the author is frustrated. They feel unappreciated and want to stop supporting parents who don't respect their choices. The plan is to cut off money once the siblings go to college, giving the parents time to move. Legally, the author owns the property, so they can ask their parents to leave. But morally, is it right to do so?\n\nArguments against the author: Parents might have a right to expect support from their children, especially if they're elderly. Even if the author owns the house, the parents may have lived there for a long time. The author's decision might be harsh, even if the parents are ungrateful. However, the author is not forcing them into poverty; they have a retirement fund and time to move. \n\nArguments for the author: The parents are unappreciative and critical, which is emotionally taxing. The author is using their earned money, and they're providing for their siblings. If the parents are unhappy with the author's lifestyle, maybe they should find their own living arrangements. The author isn't cutting off the siblings, just the parents.\n\nSo, it's a balance between family obligations and personal boundaries. The author's actions are legally justified, but morally, it's a gray area. The parents' behavior is part of the issue. If the author's support is conditional on respect and appreciation, that's reasonable. However, cutting off parents entirely might be seen as harsh, even if they're difficult. But given the context, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is prioritizing their mental health and the well-being of their siblings, and the parents have resources to move. The author isn't being cruel, just setting boundaries.\n"
