My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The author is 43, supporting their parents and siblings financially. The parents disapprove of their job, which is making good money. The author is frustrated with the lack of appreciation and wants to cut off financial support once their siblings go to college. They plan to give the parents time to find a new place to live.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many cultures, especially in some Asian or traditional societies, supporting aging parents is seen as a duty. But the author is in a situation where their parents are not appreciative, even hostile. The author is also taking care of their siblings. But the key point is whether cutting off financial support is justified here.\n\nThe parents are using the author's money, which the author earns through their job. The author feels disrespected. The question is about whether it's justified to stop support. On one hand, the author has the right to decide how to use their money. On the other, there's the expectation of family duty. However, the parents aren't contributing and are critical. The author is also taking care of their siblings, so maybe they have obligations there too.\n\nThe author is not forcing the parents to live with them, just providing financial support. If they stop, the parents would need to find their own place, but the author says they'll give ample time. So it's not an immediate eviction. The parents have a retirement fund, so they might have some resources. The author's frustration is understandable, but the parents might be relying on that support. However, the author isn't legally obligated to support them.\n\nIn terms of moral wrongdoing, if the parents are not abusive but just disapproving, is cutting them off cruel? It's a tough call. The author is in a position where they can support their family but feels unappreciated. The parents might not be in a good position if they lose that support. But the author is also within their rights to choose how to spend their money. The answer might depend on the cultural norms and the specific family dynamics. Since the author is in their 40s and the parents are in their 60s/70s, it's a delicate situation. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're using their own money and have the right to set boundaries. The parents' disapproval is affecting the author's mental health, and the author is prioritizing their own well-being and their siblings' needs. So, the answer is B.\n"
