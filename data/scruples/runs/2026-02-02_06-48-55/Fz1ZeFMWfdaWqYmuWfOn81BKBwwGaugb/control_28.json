My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for planning to cut their parents off financially and kick them out after their siblings finish college. The parents disapprove of the author's profession but the author supports their education and living expenses. The parents don't seem to appreciate this, leading to frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is providing for their parents, which might be seen as a duty in some cultures. However, the parents are ungrateful and critical. The author is also taking care of their siblings, which adds to their burden. The parents have a retirement fund, so they aren't entirely without resources. The author is giving them time to find a new place, so it's not abrupt.\n\nMoral perspectives vary. Some might argue the author has done their part, especially since the parents are critical and ungrateful. Others might say that supporting aging parents is a responsibility regardless of their behavior. The author's own well-being is a factor too\u2014being emotionally drained from constant criticism. \n\nLegally, in many places, adult children aren't obligated to support their parents financially unless there's a legal agreement. So the author isn't legally in the wrong. \n\nThe key points are the lack of gratitude from parents, the author's financial independence, and the provision of time for the parents to adjust. The siblings are being taken care of, which is a positive. The author is making a personal choice to stop supporting parents who don't support them, which could be seen as justified given the circumstances.\n\nConsidering all angles, the answer would lean towards B (the author isn't in the wrong) because the parents aren't in immediate need, the author is providing fair notice, and the parents' lack of appreciation is a valid reason for the decision.\n"
