My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is 43, supporting their parents and two siblings financially because their parents disapprove of their job. The parents don't live with the user but are in a house that the user pays for. The user wants to cut off financial support once the siblings finish college, even though the parents have a retirement fund. The question is whether the user is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, legal aspects. In many places, adult children aren't legally obligated to support their parents if the parents have their own resources. The user mentions the parents have a retirement fund, so legally, the user might not be required to continue support. But there's the emotional and moral side. The parents are disapproving of the user's profession, which is causing tension. The user is frustrated because they're working hard but not getting appreciation.\n\nCultural context matters here. In some cultures, supporting aging parents is expected, regardless of personal disagreements. In others, independence is more emphasized. The user is providing a comfortable lifestyle, but the parents aren't grateful. The user plans to stop financial support as the siblings become independent.\n\nIs cutting off support the right move? It's a personal choice. The parents aren't in immediate need, as they have retirement funds. The user isn't abandoning them suddenly but giving ample time to adjust. However, the emotional aspect is tricky. Disapproval can strain relationships, and cutting off support might be a form of setting a boundary. But some might argue the user is avoiding conflict by removing support instead of addressing the issue.\n\nPotential consequences: The parents might face financial strain if their retirement isn't enough. The user might feel guilt if the parents struggle. On the other hand, the user deserves to feel respected and not taken for granted. The siblings might be affected if their parents can't maintain their living situation.\n\nLegally and ethically, it's a gray area. The user isn't obligated to support the parents, especially if the parents are capable. But morally, if the parents are in a position where they have to move, that's a significant life change. The user's motivation is frustration with disapproval and lack of appreciation, which is valid. But is cutting off support justified? It depends on perspective. If the parents were abusive or neglectful, the user would be justified. Here, it's more about disapproval and lack of gratitude.\n\nIn summary, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong legally, and morally, it's a personal decision. But the answer might lean on whether the user's actions are selfish or a justified boundary. Since the user is providing time to adjust and the parents have resources, the user might not be the asshole. So answer B.\n"
