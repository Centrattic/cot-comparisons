My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to cut off their parents financially and kick them out. The author is 43, pays for their parents and siblings, but the parents disapprove of their job. The author feels unappreciated and wants to stop support once the siblings go to college.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to consider the cultural context. In many cultures, supporting aging parents is expected, but this varies. The author is providing for their parents, which is a big responsibility. The parents aren't happy with their career choice, which is causing tension. The author feels frustrated because their efforts aren't appreciated.\n\nThe key points are: the author is financially supporting their family, the parents are unappreciative and critical, and the author wants to cut them off once the siblings leave. Legally, the author isn't obligated to support their parents unless there's a specific agreement or if they are dependents. But morally, it's more complex. \n\nThe parents have their own retirement funds, so the author might not be legally bound. However, family dynamics can be tricky. The author's intention is to stop the financial support because of lack of appreciation, but maybe there's a middle ground, like setting boundaries or communicating better. \n\nBut the author is also taking care of their siblings' education and living situation. That shows a lot of responsibility. However, the parents might not be in a position to find new housing quickly. The author is giving them time, which is fair. The question is whether cutting off support is justified given the lack of appreciation.\n\nI should also consider if the author is being selfish or if they have the right to decide their own priorities. The parents' disapproval is personal, but the author's contributions are significant. The siblings are minors, so the author might have a duty to them as well. But once the siblings go to college, maybe the author's responsibility to the parents isn't as strong.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about fairness and respect. The parents have their own funds, so perhaps the author isn't obligated. But if the parents rely on the author's support beyond just financial, like emotional or practical help, that's another layer. The author's frustration is valid, but cutting them off completely could be seen as harsh if there's a possibility of reconciliation or compromise.\n\nHowever, the author is not forcing the parents to live off them; they have a retirement fund. The author is giving them time to find another place. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're fulfilling their own needs and setting boundaries. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is prioritizing their own well-being and the siblings' needs over the parents' disapproval.\n"
