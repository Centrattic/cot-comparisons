My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for planning to kick their parents out of their property. The situation involves the author supporting their parents and siblings financially, despite the parents' disapproval of their career choice. The author is 43, the parents are 61 and 65, and the siblings are 17 and 18. The parents are living with the siblings, and the author visits but faces criticism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. The author is providing financial support, which is commendable, but the parents aren't appreciative. The author feels frustrated and wants to cut them off when the siblings leave for college. The key points here are the author's right to their property, the parents' dependence on the author, and the potential consequences of removing them.\n\nLegally, the author owns the property, so they can ask their parents to leave. However, morally, it's more complex. The parents might have contributed to raising the author, and there's a cultural aspect where many expect to support aging parents. But the author also has their own life and may feel they've done enough. The parents' disapproval and lack of appreciation could justify the author's feelings.\n\nAnother angle is the siblings. The author is supporting them, which is a positive action. However, by cutting off the parents, the author might be affecting the siblings' living situation if they're still with the parents. The author plans to give ample notice, which is responsible, but the parents may struggle to find new housing, especially if their retirement funds aren't enough.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider obligations, there's a debate. Some might argue that the author isn't obligated to support parents who are ungrateful. Others might say there's a moral duty to care for elderly parents regardless of disagreements. The answer often depends on cultural norms and personal beliefs.\n\nIn the context of a \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) thread, the community usually looks at fairness, intentions, and consequences. The author's intention is to stop supporting unappreciative parents, which some might see as justified, while others might feel it's abandoning a duty. The fact that the author is providing for siblings shows they care, but the decision to remove the parents could be seen as self-serving if the parents are in a vulnerable position.\n\nConsidering all factors, there's a case for both sides. However, the author is within their legal rights and has a valid reason for feeling unappreciated. The moral judgment is subjective, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the scenario, the answer might be that they are not in the wrong (B), as they are choosing to focus on their own family's needs and have a legitimate reason for frustration. However, some might argue it's ungrateful, but the primary responsibility here is to their own life and the siblings they're supporting.\n"
