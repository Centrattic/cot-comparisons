My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for planning to cut off financial support and kick their parents out. The author is 43, supports their parents and siblings financially, but the parents disapprove of their profession. The parents live with the siblings, and the author wants to stop supporting them once the siblings go to college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural context. In many Western cultures, adult children aren't expected to support their parents financially unless they've taken on that responsibility. The author is already providing for their parents' living expenses, which might be seen as a personal choice rather than a duty. The parents, however, are not contributing to the household and are criticizing the author's career choice. That could be a significant source of frustration.\n\nNext, legal aspects. If the parents are living in a property owned by the author, they might be considered tenants or guests. The author has the right to set boundaries, including asking them to leave. But there's a difference between legal rights and moral obligations. The author is planning to give them time to find another place, which is reasonable and avoids immediate homelessness.\n\nEmotional and relational factors. The parents' disapproval is causing the author stress. The author feels their efforts aren't appreciated, which might justify their decision. However, cutting off support entirely could be seen as harsh, especially considering the parents' age and retirement funds. But the author mentions they have a retirement fund, so maybe they can manage without the support.\n\nEthical considerations. Is it ethical to stop supporting parents who don't appreciate you? If the author isn't legally obligated, then it's their choice. However, in some cultures, supporting aging parents is a moral duty. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not just if it's acceptable. The key points are: the author is providing financial support, the parents are unappreciative, and the author is giving them time to move out. The author is also considering the siblings' future, which shows responsibility.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say that regardless of appreciation, supporting parents is a duty. Others might argue that ending support abruptly is cruel. However, the author plans to give ample notice, which mitigates that concern. The parents do have a retirement fund, so they aren't left without resources.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's a cultural expectation in some societies to support parents, legally and ethically, the author has the right to make this decision. The parents' behavior and lack of appreciation add context that supports the author's frustration. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
