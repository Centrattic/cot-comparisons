My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be The Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author supporting their parents and siblings financially despite disapproval from the parents about their job choice. The author plans to cut off financial support and kick them out after the siblings go to college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 43, their parents are 61 and 65. The parents disapprove of their profession, which is making good money. The author is paying for the parents' living expenses and siblings' education. The parents are living together with the siblings, and the author visits to check on them but faces disapproval each time. The author feels unappreciated and wants to stop supporting them once the siblings are in college.\n\nNow, the key points here are about financial responsibility, family dynamics, and expectations. The author is providing for their family, which is a significant commitment. However, the parents aren't showing appreciation and are critical. The author's plan is to cut off financial help once a specific condition is met (siblings in college), giving them time to find another place.\n\nLegally, in many places, adult children aren't obligated to support their parents financially unless there's a legal agreement in place. So the author isn't legally in the wrong. However, ethically and socially, this is more complex. The parents have their own retirement funds, so they might be capable of supporting themselves. The author feels unappreciated and disrespected, which is a common human reaction.\n\nBut then, there's the aspect of family responsibility. The author is not just supporting their siblings but also their parents. While the parents' disapproval is hurtful, the author's decision to stop support might be seen as putting their own well-being first. However, some might argue that cutting off support entirely could be seen as harsh, especially if the parents are in a vulnerable position due to age.\n\nThe author mentions giving them time to find a place, which shows some consideration. However, the core issue is the emotional conflict. The parents are criticized for not showing appreciation, but perhaps the author could have addressed the conflict in another way, like communication or setting boundaries. The question is whether cutting off support is the right response.\n\nFrom a societal standpoint, family obligations can vary. In some cultures, supporting aging parents is expected, while in others, independence is prioritized. The author's age and financial stability might influence this. They are in a position to choose, and their decision could be seen as self-protective, especially if the parents were verbally abusive or disrespectful.\n\nHowever, others might argue that the author is neglecting their duty to their parents, especially since they are contributing to the family's well-being. The parents might rely on that support for their retirement lifestyle, even if they have funds. The author's frustration is valid, but cutting off support entirely could have emotional and practical repercussions.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are legally permissible but ethically debatable. The decision hinges on the balance between personal boundaries and family responsibility. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on perspectives on family obligations and the parents' actual needs versus their disapproval. The answer could be either A or B depending on cultural and personal values, but the question is asking if the author is in the wrong. Given that the author is prioritizing their own mental health and the siblings' future while the parents have resources, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But some might say A because cutting off family support is unkind. Need to weigh these factors.\n"
