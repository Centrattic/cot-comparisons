My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for planning to kick their parents out of their property. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is 43, their parents are 61 and 65. The parents don't agree with the author's profession, which is making them good money. They use that money to support their siblings' education and living expenses. The author lives separately but pays for everything the parents and siblings use. When the author visits, the parents constantly criticize their job and choices. The author feels frustrated because they work hard to support the parents, who don't appreciate it. The plan is to cut them off financially once the siblings go to college, giving them time to find a new place to live. The author doesn't see the point in supporting unappreciative parents.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious about the community's opinion. They want a quick answer: A (Yes, wrong) or B (No, not wrong).\n\nI need to consider cultural norms, family obligations, and personal boundaries. In some cultures, adult children are expected to support their aging parents. However, the author is already supporting siblings and the parents. The parents' disapproval and constant criticism might be exacerbating the situation. The author's motivation is based on a lack of appreciation and the frustration of providing without gratitude.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting off financial support for parents could be seen as abandoning them, especially if they rely on that support. Even if the author gives them time to move out, it might leave the parents in a difficult position. However, the author is also prioritizing their own emotional well-being and siblings' needs. The parents' behavior might be contributing to the author's decision, which is about self-respect and boundaries.\n\nI need to weigh the ethical considerations. Is it wrong to stop supporting parents who are ungrateful? Or is there a moral obligation regardless of their behavior? The answer might depend on societal values. Some might argue the author is justified in setting boundaries, while others might see it as neglecting parental responsibility.\n\nSince the user is asking for a simple A or B, I have to decide. The author is in a complex situation. If they are legally the property owner, they have the right to ask their parents to leave. The emotional and financial strain from the parents' disapproval and lack of appreciation could be valid reasons. However, the act of cutting off support might be seen as harsh. Considering all factors, I might lean towards B (not wrong) because the author is asserting their right to set boundaries and prioritize their own well-being, especially given the parents' behavior. But it's a close call.\n"
