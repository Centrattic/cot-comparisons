My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is 43, supports their parents and siblings financially, but the parents don't approve of their job. The author is planning to cut off financial support and kick them out once the siblings go to college. The question is whether the author is the asshole (A or B).\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms and expectations. In many societies, adult children supporting aging parents isn't uncommon, but it's also not mandatory. The author is providing financial support, which might be seen as generous if they are in a position to do so. However, the parents seem ungrateful and critical, which adds to the author's frustration.\n\nThe author mentions that the parents don't agree with their profession, which is a common source of conflict. The author is making money from this profession and using it to support the family. The parents' constant disapproval during visits must be stressful. The author's plan to stop financial support after the siblings leave for college could be seen as a way to set boundaries, especially if the parents aren't appreciative.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of responsibility. Even if the parents are unappreciative, are the author's obligations to them based on familial duty or personal choice? If the author initially chose to support them, is it reasonable to withdraw that support? It's a balancing act between personal well-being and family responsibilities.\n\nAnother angle is the siblings' situation. The author is helping their education and living expenses, which is a significant contribution. However, once the siblings are in college, the author's obligation to support the parents might be less clear, especially if the parents have their own retirement funds. The author is giving ample time for the parents to find a new place, which shows some level of consideration.\n\nThe key issue here is whether cutting off support is justified given the parents' lack of appreciation. If the author feels that their efforts are not recognized and that the criticism is harmful, then setting boundaries could be seen as self-preservation. On the other hand, some might argue that family support is an ongoing responsibility, regardless of the parents' attitude.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's subjective. Some might say the author is within their rights to stop supporting ungrateful parents, while others might think they should still help despite the disapproval. The fact that there's a retirement fund suggests the parents have some resources, which might mitigate the harshness of the action.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's decision to cut off support could be seen as a reasonable boundary-setting action rather than being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
