      "text": "\nOkay, so the user wants to know if the author of this WIBTA post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully. The author is 43 and has a complicated relationship with their parents, who disapprove of their profession. They make good money and support their siblings' education and living expenses. The parents live in the same house as the siblings, and the author pays for everything. When the author visits, the parents criticize their job or show disapproval. The author plans to cut off financial support and kick them out once the siblings go to college, even though the parents have a retirement fund. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The parents are disapproving of the author's career, which is causing emotional distress. But the author is financially supporting their parents and siblings. The parents are part of the household, so the author is providing for them. If the author decides to stop supporting them, is that justified? The parents have their own retirement fund, so maybe they can move out. However, the author is giving them time to find a new place, which shows some consideration. \n\nBut wait, is it the author's responsibility to support their parents? In many cultures, adult children might have different expectations regarding parental support. The author is paying for the entire house where the parents live, which could be seen as a form of support beyond just their siblings. The parents might be living off the author's income without contributing. On the other hand, the author's feelings of frustration and lack of appreciation are valid. People often expect gratitude from family for their support. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' disapproval causing emotional harm and the author's financial contributions. If the parents are ungrateful and disrespectful, the author has the right to set boundaries. However, cutting off support might leave the parents in a tough spot, even if they have a retirement fund. The author's plan to give them time is good, but it's still a significant life change for the parents. \n\nI should also think about the legal aspect. Depending on where the author is, they might have a legal obligation to support their parents, especially if the parents are dependent. But the post says the author lives separately and pays for everything, which might mean the parents aren't legally dependent. \n\nEthically, the author is not necessarily in the wrong if they have the means to support their siblings but feel unsupported and unappreciated themselves. However, the decision to kick out parents is a strong one. It's important to weigh the parents' right to live in their own home against the author's right to live without emotional strain. \n\nThe parents might have a right to their own opinions, but the author's mental well-being is also a factor. If the parents are being persistent in their disapproval during visits, that's a problem. But the author's response is to stop financial support, which might be a form of punishment. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are a way to set boundaries after years of support and disapproval. Since they are providing for their siblings and have a plan that gives the parents time to move, maybe they aren't the asshole. But it's a gray area. I think the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong because they've given enough and are setting boundaries, even if it's tough. However, there's a nuance where the parents might have a right to their own home, but the author's justification is valid.\n"
