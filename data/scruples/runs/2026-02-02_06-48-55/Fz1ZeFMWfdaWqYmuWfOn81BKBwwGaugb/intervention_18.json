My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for planning to kick their parents out of their property. The author is 43, their parents are 61 and 65, and the parents disapprove of the author's profession. The author supports their siblings' education and living expenses, and also covers the parents' house expenses. They plan to cut off financial support once the siblings go to college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, adult children aren't legally obligated to support their parents unless there's a court order or specific legal agreement. The parents have their own retirement funds, so maybe they're financially responsible. The author is providing for them now, but perhaps the parents aren't in need. Legally, the author might have the right to stop support since they aren't obligated.\n\nThen there's the emotional and ethical side. The parents are critical and disapproving, which is causing the author stress. The author feels unappreciated despite their efforts. It's understandable that they'd want to stop supporting their parents if they don't show gratitude. However, cutting off support completely might be seen as harsh, especially if the parents are relying on that financial help. But the author mentions giving them time to find another place, so they aren't abandoning them immediately.\n\nCultural factors might play a role. In some cultures, supporting aging parents is expected, while others prioritize individual autonomy. The author's decision might be more accepted in cultures that value independence over family obligation.\n\nThe parents' behavior is another angle. If they're disrespectful and critical, the author might feel justified in setting boundaries. However, cutting off all support could be seen as severing ties, which might have long-term consequences for the family relationships.\n\nI should also consider the siblings. The author is supporting them now. Once they go to college, the author's responsibility shifts, and they can focus on their own needs. The parents have their retirement, so maybe they can manage on their own. The author isn't putting them on the street, just giving them time to find a new place. That might be reasonable.\n\nBut some might argue that even if the parents are difficult, the author has a moral obligation to support them. Others might say that the author is within their rights to stop supporting them since they aren't legally bound. The key points are the author's motivation (frustration with lack of appreciation) and the practical arrangement (providing time for the parents to move).\n\nSo, considering these factors, the author's decision is more about personal boundaries and self-respect than being in the wrong. They\u2019re not causing harm immediately and are giving the parents time. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
