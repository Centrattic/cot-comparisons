My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for planning to cut off their parents financially and kick them out. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is 43, their parents are 61 and 65. The parents disapprove of the author's profession but the author makes a good income. They support their siblings' education and living expenses, even though they live separately. Every time they visit, the parents criticize their job. The author plans to stop financial support and have the parents leave once the siblings go to college. The parents have a retirement fund, so it's not like they're left with nothing. The author feels the parents don't appreciate the support.\n\nHmm. From a moral standpoint, the author is taking care of their family's needs, including parents and siblings, despite disapproval. The parents, however, are showing ingratitude and constant criticism. The author's decision to cut off financial support when the siblings are independent might be seen as a way to set boundaries. The parents aren't being put out immediately; they have time to find another place. The author is prioritizing their own well-being and their siblings' future over the parents' current comfort.\n\nBut wait, in some cultural contexts, there's an expectation to care for aging parents. However, the author mentions that the parents have a retirement fund. So they aren't completely destitute. The key here is the lack of appreciation and the negative environment during visits. The author's right to set boundaries, especially when their efforts are met with disapproval, might justify their decision. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should still support their parents regardless of the parents' behavior. But the author is also considering their siblings' future, and cutting off support for the parents could be a way to redirect resources. The parents' disapproval isn't affecting the siblings directly, so maybe the author is focusing on their own peace of mind and the well-being of the younger siblings.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They're making a choice to prioritize their own mental health and family's future, especially when the parents aren't appreciative. The decision is gradual and considerate of the parents' ability to find another home. So the answer is B.\n"
