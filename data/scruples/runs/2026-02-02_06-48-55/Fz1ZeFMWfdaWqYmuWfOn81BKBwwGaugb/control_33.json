My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is 43, their parents are 61 and 65, and they're being financially supported by the author. The parents don't agree with the author's profession, which is making them a good amount of money. The author also supports their two siblings' education and living expenses. The parents are criticized every time the author visits, and the author wants to cut them off financially once the siblings go to college.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. The author mentions that the parents have a retirement fund, so maybe they have some income of their own. If the author is providing financial support beyond what's legally required, like if the parents don't owe them anything, then taking that away could be a personal choice. But does the author have any legal obligation to support their parents? In many places, children aren't legally required to support their parents unless there's a specific arrangement or dependency. If the parents have their own retirement funds and can support themselves, the author isn't obligated.\n\nNext, the ethical side. The author is frustrated because their parents don't appreciate the support. The parents are criticizing the author's career choice, which the author finds disrespectful. The author is considering cutting off financial support as a form of punishment for the disapproval. Is it fair for the author to stop supporting their parents because they disagree with their choices? On one hand, the author is using their hard-earned money to support their siblings, which is commendable. On the other hand, cutting off parents might be seen as harsh, especially if they are elderly and might need help.\n\nBut the author mentions that the parents have a retirement fund, so maybe they can manage without the author's support. The author is also considering giving them time to find another place, which is a responsible approach. The author isn't just throwing them out immediately. \n\nThe key point here is whether the author is under any obligation to support their parents. If there's no obligation and the parents are being disrespectful, then the author might be justified in cutting off financial support. However, some people might argue that supporting aging parents is a moral duty, regardless of their behavior. \n\nThe author is also supporting their siblings, which shows a sense of responsibility. The parents' disapproval is causing emotional distress, and the author might be setting boundaries to protect their mental health. If the parents are ungrateful and critical, the author's decision could be seen as self-respect and prioritizing their own well-being and that of their siblings.\n\nBut there's a difference between cutting off money and kicking them out of the property. The author lives separately, so the parents aren't living in the author's house. Wait, the original question says \"kicked my parents out of my property.\" Wait, the author lives separately from the parents and siblings. So the parents aren't living in the author's property. Wait, the original statement says the author lives separately from the parents and siblings. So the property in question is the parents' and siblings' house. The author is paying for everything in that house. The author plans to cut them off once the siblings leave for college. So the author is the one financially supporting the parents and siblings in their own home.\n\nSo the author is providing financial support to their parents and siblings. The parents are not living in the author's house. The author is considering cutting off financial support because the parents are disapproving. The author is not evicting them from their own home, but stopping financial support. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that.\n\nIf the parents have their own retirement and can manage without the author's help, then the author isn't obligated to support them. The author's frustration is understandable if the parents are critical and unappreciative. However, cutting financial support might be a way to set boundaries. But some might say that supporting parents, especially in old age, is a moral obligation, regardless of their behavior. However, if the author isn't legally required to do so, then it's a personal choice. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author is making a difficult decision based on their own circumstances. They are also considering their siblings' future. If the parents are being ungrateful, the author might not be in the wrong. But others might see it as cold-hearted. It's a nuanced situation where personal values come into play. The answer depends on cultural expectations and personal ethics. However, given the information, the author may not be in the wrong since they are not legally obligated and are setting boundaries for their own well-being and that of their siblings.\n"
