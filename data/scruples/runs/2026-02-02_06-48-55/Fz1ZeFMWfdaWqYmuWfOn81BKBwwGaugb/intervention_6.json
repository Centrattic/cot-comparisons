My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for planning to kick their parents out of their property. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 43, and their parents are 61 and 65. The parents disapprove of the author's profession, even though it's well-paying. The author supports their siblings' education and living expenses and also pays for their parents' house. The parents are being critical every time the author visits. The author wants to cut off financial support and evict them once the siblings go to college.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are financial support, family dynamics, and the parents' disapproval. The author is providing for their parents and siblings, which is a big responsibility. But the parents aren't appreciative and are critical of the author's choices. The author feels unappreciated and wants to stop supporting them. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if the author owns the property, they might have the right to ask their parents to leave, especially if they're not on the lease. But morally or ethically, it's trickier. The author is supporting them financially and now wants to stop because of lack of appreciation. But parents might not be obligated to be appreciative. However, cutting them off completely could be seen as harsh, even if they're not being nice. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has their own life and siblings to support. The parents have a retirement fund, so maybe they can manage. The author is giving them time to find another place, which is considerate. But is it fair to expect support from a child when the parents are being unkind? \n\nIn many cultures, supporting aging parents is seen as a duty, but if the parents are disrespectful, some might say the child isn't wrong to set boundaries. However, completely cutting them off, including financially, might be seen as extreme. The author is providing for them not out of legal obligation but personal choice. If they choose to stop, maybe that's their right. \n\nBut the author is also using the siblings' education as part of their support. Once the siblings leave, maybe the author's obligations change. The key here is whether the author was ever obligated to support the parents in the first place. If they chose to do so, they can also choose to stop, especially if the dynamic is toxic. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have the right to decide how they want to handle their financial responsibilities, especially after years of support. However, it's a tough call. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because they're making a personal choice based on their own circumstances and the lack of appreciation. But some might argue it's unkind. I'm leaning towards B.\n"
