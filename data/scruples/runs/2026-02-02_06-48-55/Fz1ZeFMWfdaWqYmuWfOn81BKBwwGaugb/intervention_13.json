My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for planning to cut off financial support to their parents and kick them out. The parents are critical of the author's profession, even though it's well-paying. The author supports their siblings and parents financially, but feels unappreciated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural context. In some cultures, adult children are expected to support their parents, especially if they have the means. But in others, independence is more valued. However, this is a Western context likely, given the age and the situation.\n\nThe parents aren't contributing to the household, but they're being supported by their child. The author is frustrated with the disapproval and lack of gratitude. The siblings are minors, so they depend on the author's support. But the parents are adults. \n\nLegally, the author owns the property, so they can evict them if they own it. But morally? It's tricky. The parents might have retirement funds, but maybe they rely on the author's support. The author's justification is about not wanting to support unappreciative parents. But is cutting them off after years of support fair?\n\nAlso, the author mentions giving ample time for the parents to find another place, which shows some consideration. However, the parents might not have other options. The siblings are being taken care of, but what about their feelings? The parents' behavior might be toxic, affecting the siblings.\n\nIs the author entitled to stop supporting them? If the parents are being disrespectful and ungrateful, maybe the author isn't wrong. But is it right to cut off support just because of disapproval of a career choice? The parents could have their own issues, but the author's decision might be seen as harsh.\n\nThere's also the aspect of responsibility. If the parents are in a position where they can't support themselves, the author might feel they have a duty. But if the author isn't obligated by law or culture, then maybe it's their choice. However, the parents' criticism is a significant factor here. The author might feel justified in stopping support if the relationship is toxic.\n\nIn the end, it's a moral dilemma without clear right or wrong. The author is making a personal choice based on their situation. The key points are the author's ownership of the property, the parents' dependence, and the emotional impact. The author could be seen as not in the wrong if they're prioritizing their own well-being and the siblings' future, especially if the parents are ungrateful and critical. But others might argue that supporting aging parents is a moral obligation regardless of disapproval.\n"
