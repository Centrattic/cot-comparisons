My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is considering cutting off financial support to their parents and kicking them out once their siblings go to college. The parents disapprove of the author's profession, which makes them frustrated. The author is paying for everything in the house where the parents and siblings live, but feels unappreciated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and ethical perspectives. In many cultures, supporting aging parents is considered a duty, regardless of disagreements. However, others might argue that the author isn't obligated to do so if the parents are disrespectful.\n\nThe parents have a retirement fund, which the author mentions. So maybe they aren't in dire need. The siblings are dependent on the author financially, so once they're off to college, the author might feel less responsibility towards the parents. But is it ethical to cut them off entirely? The author is providing for their basic needs now. If they stop, the parents would need to find another place, which could be difficult if they're in poor health or not employed.\n\nEmotional aspects matter. The author feels frustrated because their efforts aren't appreciated. However, cutting off support might be seen as a harsh punishment for disapproval of a career choice. Are the parents' criticisms justified? The author's profession might be controversial, but does that justify withdrawing support?\n\nAlso, the legal aspect: if the parents are living in the author's property, are there any legal obligations or agreements? If the author owns the property, they might have the right to ask them to leave, but that's different from financial support. Ethically, though, is it right to use financial leverage to enforce living arrangements?\n\nThe siblings are 17 and 18, so they'll likely be leaving in a couple of years. The author plans to give ample time for the parents to find a new place. That shows some consideration, but does that mitigate the ethical issue?\n\nIn some views, the author's responsibility to parents is a matter of personal choice and cultural context. If the author has chosen not to be financially dependent on their parents and has the means to support them, they might feel entitled to discontinue support once their own dependents are taken care of. However, others might argue that the parents' disapproval doesn't justify cutting them off, especially since the author is the one providing the financial support.\n\nThere's also the question of reciprocity. Did the parents support the author in their upbringing? If so, does the author feel a moral obligation? The scenario doesn't mention that, so it's hard to judge. The author might be trying to maintain independence and set boundaries, which is valid, but might come across as harsh.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions could be seen as justified if they feel they've fulfilled their responsibilities and want to set boundaries. However, others might argue that cutting off support is a form of punishment for disapproval, regardless of the author's financial capability. Different perspectives here could lead to different conclusions.\n"
