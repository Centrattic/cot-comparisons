Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who is 43, is supporting their parents, two siblings, and the family's living expenses. The parents don't approve of their profession, which is making good money. The author is frustrated because when they visit, the parents criticize their job and choices. The author plans to cut off financial support once the siblings go to college, even though the parents have a retirement fund. The question is whether the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, adult children are expected to support their aging parents, even if there are disagreements. But the author is paying for the house where the parents and siblings live. The parents are living in a home provided by the author, so maybe the author isn't obligated to continue that if the parents are unappreciative. However, the parents have their own retirement savings, so maybe they can move out themselves.\n\nThe author is providing financial support beyond their own family. The siblings are being taken care of, which is a responsible move. But the parents are not appreciative, which is causing emotional distress. The author feels they don't owe their parents support if there's no gratitude. However, cutting them off completely might be seen as harsh, especially if the parents are elderly and might need more help in the future.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of filial responsibility. In some places, children are legally responsible for their parents' care, but that's more common in certain countries. In the US, for example, it's not always the case unless there's a legal agreement. If the author isn't legally obligated, then their decision might be more about personal choice. \n\nThe parents aren't in immediate need, as they have a retirement fund. The author is giving them time to find another place, which is fair. The main issue is the emotional aspect\u2014parents not respecting their child's choices. The author's motivation is frustration from lack of appreciation. \n\nBut is cutting them off the right response? Maybe the author could have tried to address the criticism first, set boundaries, or communicate their feelings. However, the parents' disapproval is ongoing, and the author is doing this to protect their own emotional well-being. \n\nThe siblings are being taken care of, which is positive. The author is prioritizing their own mental health and the siblings' needs over the parents' current housing. It's a tough call. Some might argue that the author is justified in stopping support if the parents are unappreciative, while others might say that parents deserve support regardless of their behavior, especially as they age.\n\nI think the key points are the author's provision of financial support, the parents' disapproval causing stress, and the author's plan to stop support after the siblings leave. Since the parents have a retirement fund, the author isn't leaving them homeless immediately. The author's actions are self-preservation and ensuring their siblings are cared for, which might outweigh the obligation to parents. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
