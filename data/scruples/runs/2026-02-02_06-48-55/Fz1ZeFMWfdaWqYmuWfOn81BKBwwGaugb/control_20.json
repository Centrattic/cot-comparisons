My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is 43, supporting their parents and siblings financially. The parents don't approve of their job choice, which the author says makes them a good amount of money. The author is planning to cut off financial support and kick out the parents once their siblings go to college. They live separately but pay for everything the parents and siblings share.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the cultural context. In many cultures, especially ones that emphasize family obligations, children are expected to support their parents financially, especially if they can afford it. But this varies. The author is taking care of their siblings' education and living situation, which is a big responsibility. The parents, however, are criticizing the author's profession, which is causing frustration. The author feels unappreciated and wants to stop supporting them once the siblings are in college.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author is using their own money to support the family, which they can afford to do. They are not being abusive or neglecting their siblings. The issue is the parents' disapproval and lack of appreciation. The author isn't cutting off the siblings, just the parents. The parents have their own retirement fund, so they aren't left without resources entirely. \n\nBut wait, in some cultures, cutting off parents might be seen as disrespectful, especially if the parents are elderly. However, the author is giving them time to find another place to live, so it's not like they're being thrown out immediately. The parents are still getting financial support until the siblings go to college. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be justified if the parents are abusive or harmful in some way. Here, the parents are just disapproving of the profession. If the disapproval is causing emotional distress and the author feels they can't continue to support them without resentment, maybe they have the right to set boundaries. But is it wrong to do so?\n\nLegally, adults aren't required to support their parents financially unless there are specific legal obligations. Since the parents have their own retirement fund, the author isn't legally obligated. Ethically, it's more complex. Family dynamics and expectations play a big role here. If the author is doing this to protect their own well-being and set boundaries, some might see it as necessary. Others might see it as abandoning family responsibilities.\n\nI think it's a tough call. The author is not neglecting their siblings, who are minors, and is giving their parents time to adjust. The main conflict is with the parents' disapproval. If the parents are not abusive but just disapproving, the author might be within their rights to stop financial support once the siblings are older. However, if family support is a cultural expectation they're breaking, some might argue they're in the wrong. But others might support their decision to prioritize their own well-being and set boundaries after years of unappreciated support.\n"
