My profession, while disagreeable to some, makes me a good amount of money, allowing me to basically take care of both of my siblings [17] &amp; [18] education and living situation.\n\nI pay for everything in the house that my parents and my siblings share, (I live separately from them.) Now, every time I do drop by to check on my siblings my parents continuously rag on my job or show disapproval about my choices. It feels frustrating to work hard to support both my parents as well while they don\u2019t appreciate it at all.\n\nSo I plan on cutting them off of my money and kicking them out once my two siblings go off to college. They have a retirement fund but would essentially need to search for some other place to live, I would give ample time for them to look so it wouldn\u2019t be like putting them on the streets.\n\nI just see no point in supporting my parents who don\u2019t appreciate the time or energy I put into giving them a easy lifestyle. \n\nWould I be the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to kick their parents out of their property. The author is 43, their parents are 61 and 65. The parents disapprove of the author's profession, which the author says makes them a good amount of money. The author supports their siblings and their parents, but the parents don't appreciate it. The author plans to cut off financial support and kick them out once the siblings go to college.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many Western cultures, adult children aren't expected to support their parents financially, but in some other cultures, family support is more expected. However, the question is more about whether the author is in the wrong, not cultural norms.\n\nThe author is providing for their parents and siblings, but the parents are critical. The author feels disrespected and unappreciated. They're planning to stop support after the siblings leave. The key points here are: the author is financially supporting parents who are not appreciative, the parents are disapproving, and the author wants to cut ties.\n\nLegally, the author isn't obligated to support their parents unless there's a legal responsibility, like in some countries where adult children must support elderly parents. But in the US, for example, there's no such legal obligation. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nEthically, it's more complex. The parents may have a right to their opinions, but the author is providing for them. However, the parents are not respecting the author's choices and are unappreciative. The author is frustrated and wants to stop supporting them as a form of self-respect. \n\nThe siblings are also involved, and the author is paying for their education and living. If the parents are kicked out, the siblings might be affected. But the author is giving them time to find new housing, so maybe that's a consideration.\n\nThe parents have a retirement fund, so they're not destitute. The author is allowing them time to move, so it's not an immediate eviction. The author's reasoning is that they don't see the point in supporting unappreciative parents. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, some might argue that children should support their parents regardless of the parents' behavior. Others might say that if the parents are unkind and unappreciative, the child isn't obligated to continue support. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as a form of self-respect and setting boundaries, especially if the parents are being verbally abusive. However, others might see it as cutting off family ties unnecessarily. \n\nThe key factors here are the author's right to their own money, the parents' disapproval versus appreciation, and the author's desire to stop supporting them after a certain point. Legally, the author is in the right. Ethically, it's a grey area. \n\nConsidering the question is about being the \"asshole,\" the community might split. Some will say the author is justified in stopping support due to lack of appreciation. Others will say that as a child, you should support your parents regardless. But since the parents have their own retirement funds and the author is giving them time to move, it might be seen as reasonable. \n\nSo, based on the information, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They are setting boundaries and not obligated to support unappreciative parents.\n"
