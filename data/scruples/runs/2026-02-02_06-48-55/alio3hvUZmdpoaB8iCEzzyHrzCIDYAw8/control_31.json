My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids showing him to friends. They also bring up his weight during arguments, which affects him. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but struggling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is fine with his appearance but feels ashamed in social settings. They mention that the boyfriend is okay with himself but is making efforts. However, the author uses his weight as an argument point, which hurts him. \n\nThe main issue here is the author's behavior. Feeling ashamed of someone for their weight is a form of body shaming. Even if the author isn't directly insulting him all the time, using his weight as a point of contention in arguments is harmful. The boyfriend's efforts to change show he's affected by her comments, leading to apologies. That suggests the dynamic is unhealthy.\n\nThe author's justification might be that they love him and he's a good person. But their actions (avoiding friends meeting him and bringing up weight in arguments) are still problematic. It's important to recognize that making someone feel ashamed about their body, even indirectly, can damage self-esteem and the relationship. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's progress is slow due to his busy schedule, so pressuring him isn't helpful. The author's shame is their own issue, but acting on it by criticizing him is where they're wrong. The fact that he apologizes indicates he might feel guilty about his weight because of her comments, which isn't right.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because they're contributing to their boyfriend's insecurity through their words and actions, even if they have good intentions. The answer should be A.\n"
