My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and occasionally bringing it up during arguments.\n\nFirst, the writer mentions they're okay with his appearance but don't want friends to meet him to avoid judgment. That's a red flag. Feeling ashamed of someone you love for their body is problematic because it's about their weight rather than their character. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, which shows he cares about her feelings, but the writer is using his weight as a point in arguments. Even if she's not directly belittling him, bringing up his weight in arguments can be hurtful and disrespectful. \n\nThe boyfriend is described as sweet and considerate, prioritizing her needs. It's important to support his efforts without making him feel like his worth is tied to his appearance. The writer's shame might stem from her own internalized biases or fear of social judgment, but that doesn't excuse her behavior. Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect and acceptance. \n\nAlso, the fact that he apologizes when she brings up his weight suggests he's sensitive about it, and she's not helping by making it a topic of conflict. Even if she's not overtly cruel, the underlying shame is harmful. The key here is whether her actions are respecting his feelings and self-worth. Since she's causing him emotional distress and using his appearance as a point of contention, she's likely in the wrong. \n\nAnswering A (Yes) makes sense because the shame and using his weight as an argument point are not acceptable in a healthy relationship. The writer should work on her own insecurities and support her partner without judgment.\n"
