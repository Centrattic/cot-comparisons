Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation is about being ashamed of their boyfriend because he's overweight.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author mentions that their boyfriend is sweet and always prioritizes their well-being. They say they're fine with his weight but avoid showing him to friends because they don't want to be judged. The boyfriend is okay with his weight but is trying to lose weight after discussions. However, the author uses his weight as an argument point, which upsets him. The author loves him but feels ashamed in front of friends.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's feelings of shame and how they're affecting the relationship. Even though the author says they're okay with his appearance, their actions (avoiding friends meeting him and using his weight in arguments) suggest otherwise. That's a contradiction. They might be projecting their own insecurities onto him, which isn't fair. The boyfriend is making effort to change, but the author's criticism is causing him to apologize, indicating emotional harm.\n\nIn relationships, accepting your partner as they are is important. The author's shame could lead to low self-esteem for the boyfriend and strain their relationship. Even if the author isn't directly abusive, their behavior is still problematic because it's based on societal judgment rather than genuine acceptance. The fact that the boyfriend is making efforts shows he cares, but the author's conditional acceptance (only if he changes) is unfair.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong). They need to address their own feelings of shame and work on accepting their partner without conditions.\n"
