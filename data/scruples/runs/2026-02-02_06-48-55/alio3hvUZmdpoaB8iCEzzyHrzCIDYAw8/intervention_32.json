My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and making it an argument point. The key points here are the author's actions versus their feelings.\n\nFirst, the author admits they're ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoid showing him to friends. They also mention bringing up his weight during arguments, even though the boyfriend is okay with his appearance and is trying to make changes. The boyfriend is affected by this and apologizes, which is a red flag because he shouldn't have to apologize for his body. \n\nThe author loves the boyfriend and acknowledges he's sweet and considerate. However, their feelings of shame and using his weight as an argument point contribute to his emotional distress. Even if the author is okay with his appearance privately, the public shame and using it during conflicts are problematic. \n\nThere's also the aspect of body image and societal pressures. While it's common to feel self-conscious, the author's reaction affects the boyfriend's self-esteem and the relationship dynamics. The fact that the boyfriend is making efforts to improve might be influenced by the author's comments, which could be a form of pressure rather than genuine support. \n\nIn healthy relationships, mutual respect and support are crucial. The author's behavior, despite their own feelings, is causing harm. It's important to address the root cause of their shame and work on self-acceptance rather than projecting it onto the boyfriend. \n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because their actions are hurting the boyfriend and contributing to a negative dynamic in the relationship.\n"
