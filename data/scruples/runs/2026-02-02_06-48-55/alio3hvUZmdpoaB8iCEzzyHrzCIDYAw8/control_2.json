My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves feeling ashamed of their overweight boyfriend and avoiding introducing him to friends because of that. \n\nFirst, the author mentions they are okay with their boyfriend's weight but feel ashamed when friends see him. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, but progress is slow. The author also brings up the boyfriend's weight during arguments, which affects him negatively.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, feeling ashamed of someone's appearance is a personal feeling, but acting on it by avoiding social introductions and making it a point of conflict can be problematic. The boyfriend is already affected emotionally by this, which suggests that the author's behavior is impacting him negatively. Even if the author isn't directly bullying him, creating a situation where the boyfriend is made to feel insecure because of the author's preferences could be seen as wrong. The boyfriend's efforts to change his habits show he wants to meet the author's expectations, but the root issue is the author's shame, not the boyfriend's weight. Relationships should be based on mutual respect and support, not shame. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
