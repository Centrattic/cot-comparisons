My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about feeling ashamed of her boyfriend's weight and avoiding friends meeting him. The author admits she's fine with how he looks but doesn't want friends to see him because she's ashamed. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but has slow progress, and she uses his weight as a point in arguments, making him apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The main issue is the shame and how it affects the relationship. The author loves him and acknowledges he's a good person. However, her actions (avoiding friends and bringing up weight in arguments) are problematic. \n\nShaming someone about their body, even if it's not direct, can still be harmful. The boyfriend is trying his best, and the author is using his weight as a reason for arguments. This could be a form of emotional manipulation or guilt-tripping. Even though she's not outright criticizing his appearance, the shame she feels is causing her to treat him poorly. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's feelings are being affected. He's affected by her comments and apologizes, which might indicate he's internalizing the shame. That's not healthy for either partner. The author's actions might be contributing to his low self-esteem, even if she's not doing it intentionally.\n\nThe fact that she's in good shape and he's overweight is a personal matter, but the way she handles it is the issue. Avoiding friends meeting him because of shame is a red flag. It's important for a relationship to present each other in a positive light, not hide due to insecurity. \n\nShe mentions she's trying to avoid friends seeing him, which is a form of social exclusion based on his weight. That's a sign of insecurity on her part, and it's not fair to him. Even if she's not directly bullying him, the emotional impact is still there. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because her actions are causing emotional distress to her boyfriend and she's not supporting him adequately. She should be addressing her own insecurities rather than letting them affect their relationship negatively. The answer would be A.\n"
