My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The boyfriend is making an effort to lose weight, but it's not working fast enough. The author avoids showing him to friends, which makes him feel bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The boyfriend is described as sweet and putting the author first, which suggests he's supportive. However, the author's shame is affecting his self-esteem. Even though the author says she's okay with his looks, the fact that she's ashamed and it's becoming a point of argument is problematic.\n\nI remember reading about how body image issues in relationships can lead to emotional distress. The boyfriend is already affected by her comments, apologizing after arguments. That shows he's internalizing her shame, which is not healthy. The author might be projecting her own insecurities or societal pressures onto him.\n\nAlso, the boyfriend is making efforts to change, but the author's expectations might be unrealistic given his busy schedule. It's possible she's using his weight as a way to control or guilt-trip him, which isn't fair. True acceptance should mean supporting him regardless of his efforts, not just when they meet her standards.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to avoid letting personal insecurities affect the partner's self-worth. The author's actions, even if not intentional, are harming the boyfriend emotionally. She needs to address her own feelings of shame and communicate more constructively instead of using his appearance as an argument point.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is indeed in the wrong. Her shame is causing harm, and she needs to reflect on her behavior and how it affects her partner.\n"
