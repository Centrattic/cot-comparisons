My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about whether it's okay for them to feel ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and keep it a secret from friends.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is described as sweet and prioritizes the author's well-being, which is positive. The author says they're okay with his appearance but don't want friends to meet him because they feel judged. That's a key point. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's slow, and the author brings up his weight during arguments, which he reacts to emotionally.\n\nHmm. The author loves him and acknowledges his good qualities, but their shame is affecting their relationship. The boyfriend is trying to address the issue on his own, but the author's comments during arguments might be hurting him. Even if the author isn't malicious, the fact that they're making him feel he needs to apologize for his body could be problematic. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of body image and how one's own insecurities affect a partner. The author's shame might stem from their own fears of judgment, but it's not the boyfriend's fault. It's important to consider that making someone feel ashamed about their body can damage self-esteem and trust in a relationship. \n\nThe boyfriend's efforts to improve his health are commendable, but the author's behavior during conflicts might undermine his progress and make him feel like his worth is tied to his appearance. Even if the author's intentions aren't bad, the impact is there. So, in terms of right or wrong, the author is contributing to a situation where the boyfriend feels judged and the author is hiding their partner, which might not be healthy. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they're projecting their own insecurities onto their partner and affecting his self-worth through their actions.\n"
