My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and not wanting friends to meet him, even though they love him and he's making efforts to change.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. They avoid friends meeting him because they don't want to be judged. The boyfriend is okay with his appearance but has started trying to lose weight. However, the author sometimes brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him and makes him apologize.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the answer is A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the ethical aspects here. Feeling ashamed of someone's appearance is a personal feeling, but acting on it by not introducing them to friends and using their weight as an argument point can be harmful. The boyfriend is making efforts, so the author's behavior might be contributing to his low self-esteem, even if unintentionally. \n\nThe key factors here are the impact on the boyfriend's well-being, the author's role in making the boyfriend feel bad during arguments, and the fact that the author is prioritizing their own feelings over their partner's. Even if the author is in a good relationship otherwise, this behavior can be seen as inconsiderate and potentially hurtful. \n\nIn AITA contexts, the community often looks at whether the person is perpetuating harm or contributing to the problem. The author's actions are causing emotional distress to their partner, which is a strong indicator that they are in the wrong. So the answer is likely A."
