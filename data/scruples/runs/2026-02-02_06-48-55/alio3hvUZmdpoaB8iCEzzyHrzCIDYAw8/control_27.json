He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong for being ashamed of her boyfriend's weight.\n\nFirst, the situation: She's in a year-long relationship with a boyfriend she describes as sweet and considerate. She's in good shape, while he's overweight. She's okay with his appearance but doesn't want her friends to see him because she's ashamed. He's trying to lose weight but it's hard because of his schedule and habits. She brings up his weight during arguments, which affects him, and he apologizes.\n\nSo, the key points here. She's okay with how he looks but feels shame around her friends. She's making him feel bad about his body, even though he's trying to improve. She's in a position where she's affecting his self-esteem by using his weight as an argument point. Even if he's making efforts, the fact that she's ashamed of him is problematic. \n\nShaming someone for their body is generally considered wrong because it can lead to low self-esteem, health issues, and strain relationships. Even if she's not directly bullying him, the fact that she's avoiding friends meeting him because of shame implies she's uncomfortable with his body. It's not just about her own preferences but how her behavior affects him. \n\nHe's already trying to change, which shows he's aware of her feelings, but she's still using it as a point in arguments. That can be hurtful. Even if she loves him, the shame she feels is causing her to act in ways that hurt him. The right approach would be to support him without shame, encouraging his efforts without making him feel bad. \n\nAlso, the fact that he apologizes when she brings it up suggests he feels guilty about his weight because of her comments. That's a sign that her behavior is impacting his self-worth negatively. So, even if her intentions aren't malicious, the effect is harmful. \n\nIn terms of societal standards, body shaming is widely discouraged. Relationships should be built on mutual respect and support. If one partner is making the other feel ashamed or guilty about their body, that's a red flag. The author's shame and using his weight as an argument point contribute to that. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she's shaming her boyfriend's body, which is hurtful and damaging to their relationship and his self-esteem.\n"
