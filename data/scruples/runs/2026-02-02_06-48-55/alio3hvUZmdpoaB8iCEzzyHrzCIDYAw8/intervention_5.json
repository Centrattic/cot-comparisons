My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of her boyfriend's weight. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions she's okay with her boyfriend's weight but doesn't want her friends to meet him, leading to shame. She also brings up his weight during arguments, which he takes as criticism, even though she says she's fine with it. That seems contradictory. If she's actually comfortable with him, why hide him from friends? That points to personal insecurity or societal judgment, maybe she's worried about what others will think.\n\nHer boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, which shows he values her opinion, even if he's okay with himself. The fact that he apologizes when she brings it up during arguments suggests he's hurt by her comments. That's a red flag. Even if she's not overtly criticizing, making it an argument point can be emotionally harmful. \n\nAlso, she's in good shape, so there might be an underlying issue of self-esteem or societal pressures about body image. The key here is that she's projecting her own insecurities onto the relationship. The boyfriend is doing his best, so her shame isn't just about his weight but her own feelings of embarrassment. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other without making the other feel bad. Even if the author's intentions are to help, the way she's handling it is causing emotional distress. So yes, she's in the wrong because she's letting her shame affect their relationship and his self-esteem negatively.\n"
