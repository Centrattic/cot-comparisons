My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about being ashamed of their boyfriend because he's overweight, even though they say they're fine with his looks. They avoid showing him to friends due to fear of judgment and have made it a point of argument sometimes, which affects him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author loves their boyfriend and acknowledges his positive traits, but their shame is causing issues. They admit that they don't want friends to meet him because of how others might judge. Even though they say they're okay with his weight, the shame is there, and they've mentioned it during arguments, which can be hurtful.\n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners feel respected and valued. If one partner is ashamed of the other's appearance, that can be a form of emotional harm, even if it's not direct. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, which shows he's trying to meet their expectations, but the author's behavior might be contributing to his low self-esteem or pressure. \n\nAlso, the fact that the boyfriend apologizes after arguments related to his weight suggests that he's internalizing the criticism, which isn't healthy. The author's shame, even if not verbalized directly, is affecting their partner's self-worth. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, being ashamed of someone for something they can't fully control (like weight, which is influenced by many factors including genetics, lifestyle, and health) can be considered a form of prejudice or insecurity on the author's part. It's also a double standard if they're okay with their partner's weight in private but not in public. \n\nThe author's actions, even if not malicious, are causing emotional distress. Therefore, it's likely that the author is in the wrong because their feelings of shame are impacting their partner negatively, and they should address their own insecurities or biases rather than letting them affect their relationship.\n"
