My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the boyfriend is overweight, but the author is okay with how he looks. The problem arises when they're around friends, and the author feels ashamed. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but isn't making much progress. Also, during arguments, the author brings up the weight issue, which affects the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author admits they don't want friends to see their boyfriend because of shame. Even though the author says they're fine with his appearance, the shame is directed outward, towards friends. That's a problem because it's about the author's own feelings of judgment from others. The boyfriend is making efforts, but the author is using his weight as an argument point, which can be hurtful. The boyfriend is also affected and apologizes, which indicates that the author's comments are impacting him negatively.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms and relationships, it's generally considered okay to have personal preferences, but shame or making someone feel bad about their body in a relationship is often seen as problematic. The author's behavior might be contributing to the boyfriend's low self-esteem, even if he's trying to change. Also, the fact that the author is using the weight as an argument point shows that it's not just about their own feelings but is being weaponized in conflicts, which is definitely harmful.\n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend's efforts to improve his health are there, but the author's shame might be undermining his motivation. Even if the author isn't directly criticizing him, the shame and occasional arguments can create a stressful environment. It's important to support a partner's well-being without making them feel ashamed. The author's actions, while maybe not malicious, are still causing emotional distress. So, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they're projecting their own insecurities and social anxiety onto their partner, which isn't fair or supportive.\n"
