      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is in a one-year relationship with a boyfriend they describe as very sweet and attentive. He prioritizes their well-being, chooses their preferred food places, takes them to places they like, and keeps them entertained. The author is in good shape, and the boyfriend is overweight. The author says they're fine with his weight and appearance, but they avoid letting friends meet him because they don't want to be judged. The boyfriend is okay with his looks but has been trying to lose weight by dieting and exercising on his own time, though he's been making slow or no progress. When they argue, the author sometimes brings up his weight as an issue, which makes him apologize. The author loves him and considers him the nicest guy they've met, but they still feel ashamed when friends meet him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong (AITA). The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to see if that's the case.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author is ashamed of their partner's weight and avoids social situations involving friends. They also use the boyfriend's weight as a topic during arguments, leading to him apologizing. The boyfriend is making efforts to change, which is commendable, but the author's actions and comments are affecting him emotionally.\n\nShame and body image issues are sensitive topics. Even if the author says they're fine with his appearance, the fact that they feel ashamed of him in social contexts could be a problem. It's possible the author is projecting their own insecurities onto the relationship, which isn't fair to the boyfriend. The boyfriend's efforts to diet and exercise might be driven by the author's comments, which could lead to a cycle where the author feels guilty for pushing, but the boyfriend is struggling with his self-esteem or health due to pressure.\n\nUsing someone's weight as a point of argument, even occasionally, can be hurtful. It's a sensitive issue and might make the boyfriend feel that his self-worth is tied to his body weight, especially if he already has some insecurities. The fact that he apologizes after these arguments suggests that his self-esteem is being affected, and the author's bringing up the weight issue during conflicts might be a way of manipulating or guilt-tripping him, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe author's avoidance of friends meeting the boyfriend because they don't want to be judged is also a red flag. It implies that the author is more concerned with how others perceive them rather than supporting their partner. This can be a form of indirect pressure on the boyfriend to change for the author's sake, not his own. If the author values the relationship, they should focus on their partner's qualities beyond physical appearance.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is making efforts to improve, which the author acknowledges. The author does express love and appreciation for who he is, so there's a positive aspect. However, the behavior of using weight as a topic during arguments and avoiding social interactions due to shame still points to a potential issue in how the author treats the boyfriend's body image.\n\nIn many relationship advice contexts, shaming a partner for their weight, even if it's not their fault, is considered harmful. It can lead to low self-esteem, eating disorders, or other mental health issues. The fact that the author is making it a point of contention during arguments, and that the boyfriend feels the need to apologize, suggests that the author's actions are contributing to his emotional distress.\n\nThe author might not be overtly abusive, but their feelings of shame and using them as an argument tool are problematic. Healthy relationships should involve mutual respect and support, not using personal insecurities as leverage. The boyfriend's efforts to change are commendable, but the author's approach might be counterproductive if it's based on their own societal pressures rather than the boyfriend's health.\n\nI think the key here is that the author's shame is causing harm. Even if they don't mean to, the impact on the boyfriend is significant. The author might need to address their own feelings of shame and where they come from, perhaps societal standards of attractiveness, and consider how to support their partner without making them feel like their appearance is a problem. So, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because their actions are based on shame and judgment, affecting the boyfriend's emotional well-being and potentially his self-image, despite loving him.\n"
