My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and not wanting friends to see him. The author says they're fine with his looks but avoid friends meeting him. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight, but progress is slow. When they argue, the author brings up his weight, which affects him.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the shame and the effect on the boyfriend. Even if the author is being honest, making the boyfriend feel bad because of his weight and avoiding friends seeing him seems harmful. The boyfriend is already affected by it and apologizes, which indicates that the author's comments are hurting him. The fact that the author is in a relationship where they prioritize their own feelings over their partner's self-esteem might be a problem. Also, body shaming, even if it's not direct, can be damaging. The author's actions could be contributing to the boyfriend's emotional distress. So even if the author isn't directly calling him fat, making him feel ashamed and using it as an argument point is probably not healthy. The boyfriend is trying to improve, but the author's behavior might be counterproductive. So, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
