My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation details that the author is okay with the boyfriend's appearance but avoids introducing him to friends due to fear of judgment. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's slow, and the author brings up the weight issue during arguments, making him apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The author is in a relationship where they love the boyfriend but have feelings of shame that affect their actions. The boyfriend is making efforts to change, which shows he's responsive to the author's concerns. However, using his weight as an argument point during conflicts is problematic because it can lead to emotional harm. Even if the author isn't openly critical, the fact that they feel ashamed and project that onto the relationship dynamics is an issue. \n\nShame is a powerful emotion, and when one partner feels ashamed of another, it can erode the relationship's foundation. The fact that the author avoids introducing him to friends suggests a lack of full acceptance and integration into their social circle, which might make the boyfriend feel less valued. Even if the author doesn't explicitly criticize his weight, the avoidance implies a form of judgment. \n\nAdditionally, the boyfriend's efforts to improve his health are commendable, but the author's comments during arguments could undermine his self-esteem. It's important to consider that while the author may not have malicious intent, their actions still have negative consequences. The boyfriend's immediate apology indicates that he internalizes the criticism, which isn't healthy for either partner.\n\nFrom a relationship health perspective, both partners should support each other's well-being without using it as a point of contention. The author's shame is a personal struggle, but in a committed relationship, it's essential to address such feelings constructively, perhaps through open communication or counseling. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because their feelings of shame are affecting the relationship negatively, even if unintentionally. They need to reflect on why they feel ashamed and work on accepting their partner without letting societal judgments interfere.\n"
