My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person is asking if they're at fault for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. They mention that they love him and he's sweet, but they don't want friends to meet him because they feel judged. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but it's hard for him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main issue is the author's feeling of shame about their partner's body. Even if they say they're okay with his weight, the fact that they avoid showing him to friends suggests underlying issues. The boyfriend is making efforts, which is good, but the author is using his weight as an argument point, which could be hurtful. \n\nBody shaming is a big issue. Even if the author isn't directly calling him out for being fat, their shame and using it in arguments might contribute to his insecurity. The boyfriend's apology after arguments indicates that he's affected, which means the author's words are impacting him negatively. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that their friends might judge them. That's more about the author's own insecurities or social anxieties rather than the boyfriend's fault. It's not the boyfriend's responsibility to change to meet the author's social standards. \n\nLoving someone but feeling ashamed of them is contradictory. Even if the author loves him, their actions (avoiding friends, using weight as an argument) aren't supportive. The boyfriend's efforts to improve are commendable, but the author should support him without making it a point of contention. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's bodies. The author's shame is a personal issue that affects the relationship. They need to work on their own feelings of shame rather than projecting it onto the boyfriend. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they're allowing their own insecurities to affect their partner's self-esteem and the relationship dynamics. The answer should be A.\n"
