My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight.\n\nFirst, the situation: The boyfriend is overweight, but the author says they're okay with how he looks. However, they don't want friends to see him because they feel judged. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight, but progress is slow. The author sometimes brings his weight up during arguments, which upsets him. He apologizes, which seems odd because he shouldn't have to apologize for his body.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is ashamed, leading to hiding the boyfriend from friends. Even though they say they're okay with his appearance, the shame is causing emotional harm. The boyfriend is making efforts, but the author is still using his weight as a point of contention in arguments. That's not supportive. The boyfriend feels affected and apologizes, which isn't right because he's not doing anything wrong.\n\nShame and body image issues can be really damaging. The author's actions, even if they don't realize it, are contributing to the boyfriend's self-esteem issues. The fact that the author is hiding him from friends because of appearance is a sign of internalized bias or stigma. Even if the author isn't intentionally hurting him, the effect is harmful. The boyfriend's efforts to improve might be driven by the author's pressure, which isn't healthy. The relationship should be about mutual respect and support, not making someone feel bad about their body.\n\nSo, yes, the author is in the wrong. The shame they feel is leading to behaviors that hurt their partner. Even if they care about him, their actions are still harmful. The answer should be A.\n"
