My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong (AITA). Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids introducing him to friends because they don't want to be judged. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but is making slow progress. The author says they love him and are okay with how he looks, but the shame comes from their own feelings. The boyfriend is affected by this, apologizing when there's an argument about his weight.\n\nFirst, the key point here is the shame and the impact it's having on the boyfriend. The author mentions that they bring up the weight issue during arguments, which leads the boyfriend to apologize. Even if the author is \"okay\" with his weight, their actions (avoiding friends and bringing up the issue in arguments) are causing him emotional distress. This seems to indicate that the problem isn't just about the author's feelings but how it's affecting the boyfriend.\n\nThe boyfriend is making an effort to improve his health, but the author's behavior might be undermining his confidence. The fact that he apologizes after arguments suggests he's taking these comments to heart, even if the author isn't intending to be harsh. The author's shame is a personal feeling, but acting on it in a way that makes someone else feel bad is problematic. It's about how their words and actions are impacting the relationship and the boyfriend's self-esteem.\n\nAlso, the author states they're fine with his appearance but avoid friends. That's a contradiction because if they're okay with him, why avoid others? It points to a deeper insecurity or societal judgment that the author is projecting. The boyfriend's efforts to change his habits are commendable, but the root issue is the author's shame, which isn't the boyfriend's fault.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other's health goals without making them feel ashamed. The author's behavior, even if unintentional, is causing harm. So, they are in the wrong because their feelings are leading to negative consequences for the boyfriend. The answer should be A.\n"
