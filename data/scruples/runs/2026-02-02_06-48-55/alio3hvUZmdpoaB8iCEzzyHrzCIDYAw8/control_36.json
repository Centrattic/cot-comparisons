My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The writer is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids friends meeting him. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but making slow progress. The writer sometimes uses the weight as an argument point, which affects him.\n\nFirst, the core issue is the writer's shame and how it's impacting the relationship. Even though they say they're fine with his weight, their actions (avoiding friends and using it as a point of argument) suggest otherwise. The boyfriend is making efforts, which shows he's trying to address their concerns, but the writer still turns it into an argument. That's unfair because it's not his fault he's overweight and he's already trying. The writer's behavior could be hurtful and might not be healthy for the relationship. The key here is that shaming someone for their body, even if they're trying to improve, is generally not acceptable. So the answer is A, the writer is in the wrong.\n"
