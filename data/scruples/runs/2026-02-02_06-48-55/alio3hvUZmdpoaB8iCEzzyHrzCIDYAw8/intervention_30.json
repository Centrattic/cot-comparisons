My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author is ashamed of her boyfriend's weight, avoids friends meeting him, and sometimes brings up his weight during arguments. He's making efforts to lose weight but hasn't succeeded yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here. The author is embarrassed about her partner's appearance, which leads her to hide him from friends. That's a problem because everyone deserves to be proud of their partner and not feel ashamed. Even though she says she's fine with how he looks, her actions suggest otherwise. Using his weight as a point in arguments is hurtful, even if he's okay with it. It's important to respect someone's self-esteem and not use their insecurities as leverage in conflicts. \n\nThe boyfriend is making efforts to change, but the author's behavior might be adding pressure on him. Healthy relationships should support each other without judgment. The fact that he apologizes after she brings up his weight indicates that he's hurt, which shows her words have an impact. Even if her intentions are good, the way she's handling it is harmful. \n\nAdditionally, the author's friends not meeting the boyfriend could lead to misunderstandings or the boyfriend feeling excluded. It's about mutual respect and not making someone feel like they're a burden. So, putting all this together, the author is indeed in the wrong because her actions are affecting his self-esteem and their relationship negatively. The answer should be A.\n"
