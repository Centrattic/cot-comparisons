My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the boyfriend is overweight, the author is fine with his appearance but avoids others seeing him. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, but progress is slow. The author sometimes brings up the weight issue during arguments, which affects the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship where they have conflicting feelings. They love the boyfriend but feel ashamed of his weight, even though they accept him. The boyfriend is trying to change his habits, which shows he's not forcing him to change, but the author is still bringing it up during arguments. That could be hurtful. \n\nThe key points here are the shame component and using the boyfriend's weight as an argument point. Even if the author is not pressuring the boyfriend to lose weight, the fact that they avoid friends seeing him and feel ashamed might be a problem. Also, bringing up the weight during arguments, even if the boyfriend is okay with it, could be a form of emotional manipulation or hurting his feelings. The boyfriend's apology after these arguments suggests that it's affecting him negatively.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's feelings and not make someone feel bad about themselves. The author's shame might stem from their own insecurities or societal pressures. However, projecting that shame onto the boyfriend and using it as an argument point is not healthy. The boyfriend's efforts to improve are commendable, but the author's behavior is still problematic because it's based on their own discomfort rather than the boyfriend's well-being.\n\nSo, even though the author isn't forcing the boyfriend to lose weight, the shame and using it as a weapon in arguments makes them at fault. The right approach would be to support the boyfriend without judgment and address their own feelings of shame, maybe through self-reflection or counseling. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
