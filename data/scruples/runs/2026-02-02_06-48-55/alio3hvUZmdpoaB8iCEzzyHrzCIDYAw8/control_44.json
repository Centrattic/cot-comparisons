My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong (AITA). The situation involves the author being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight despite finding him sweet and kind.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, which shows he's trying to meet the author's expectations. The author, however, still avoids introducing him to friends due to shame. Even though she says she's okay with his appearance, her actions (avoiding friends) indicate otherwise. \n\nThe key points here are about self-esteem and respect. The author's shame might stem from her own insecurities or societal standards. By making the boyfriend feel ashamed and using his weight as a point in arguments, she's contributing to his emotional distress. The boyfriend's apology after arguments suggests he's internalizing the criticism, which isn't healthy.\n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners feel valued and respected. The author's behavior, even if not intentional, is affecting her boyfriend negatively. The fact that she's aware of this but still continues the behavior might mean she's in the wrong because it's impacting his self-esteem and the relationship dynamics. \n\nSo, the answer would be A since the author's actions are harmful, even if she's trying to support him. The shame she feels is leading to behaviors that aren't supportive of her boyfriend's well-being.\n"
