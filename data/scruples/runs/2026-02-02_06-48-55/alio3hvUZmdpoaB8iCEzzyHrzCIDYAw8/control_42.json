My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is ashamed of their boyfriend's weight and avoids having friends meet him, even though the boyfriend is okay with his appearance and is trying to lose weight. The author sometimes brings up the weight issue during arguments, which affects the boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The boyfriend is making efforts to lose weight, but progress is slow. The author's shame is causing them to hide him from friends, which can be hurtful. Even though the author says they're okay with his looks, their actions (avoiding friends) show otherwise. Plus, using the weight as an argument point is not healthy for the relationship. Making someone feel ashamed about their body, even if they're not ashamed themselves, is generally considered a problem. It can lead to low self-esteem and issues in the relationship. The boyfriend's efforts might be undermined by the author's negative reinforcement. Also, the fact that the author feels ashamed despite being fine with his look is contradictory. So, the author is contributing to a negative environment, which is why they might be in the wrong. The answer is likely A.\n"
