My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being ashamed of their boyfriend's weight.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is described as sweet and caring, prioritizing the author's needs. The author is in good shape, and while they accept his weight, they feel ashamed when friends see him. They avoid showing him to friends. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but is making slow progress. The author uses his weight as a point in arguments, which affects him emotionally.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's shame and how they handle it. Feeling ashamed of someone for their body size can be harmful. Even if the author says they're okay with it, their actions (avoiding friends, using it in arguments) cause emotional distress. The boyfriend is making efforts, which shows he's trying to improve, but the author's behavior undermines that.\n\nAlso, body image issues are sensitive. The author's shaming, even if unintentional, contributes to the boyfriend's insecurities. Healthy relationships involve support, not shaming. The fact that the author brings up weight during arguments suggests a deeper issue of not respecting his body, which can erode trust and self-esteem.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is contributing to the boyfriend's emotional pain through their actions and words. Even if they love him, their behavior is harmful. So, the answer is A.\n"
