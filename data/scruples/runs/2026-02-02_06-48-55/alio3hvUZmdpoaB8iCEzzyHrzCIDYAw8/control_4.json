My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that she's ashamed of her boyfriend for being overweight and avoids showing him to her friends, even though she says she's okay with his appearance. She also mentions that she brings up his weight during arguments, which makes him apologize. He's trying to lose weight but struggling. They've been together over a year, and he's described as sweet and selfless.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are her feelings of shame, the impact on her boyfriend, and her behavior during arguments. Even though she claims to be okay with his appearance, her actions (avoiding friends) suggest shame. Bringing up his weight in arguments and making him feel like he needs to apologize is likely hurtful. The boyfriend's efforts to improve his health are there, but her comments might be affecting his self-esteem. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other's well-being without making the other feel ashamed. Feeling ashamed for someone you love is problematic because it can lead to harmful behaviors. Even if her intentions are to help, the way she's handling it is causing emotional distress. The boyfriend's apology after arguments indicates that he's taking her comments to heart, which isn't healthy. \n\nAlso, avoiding friends meeting him because of his weight shows a lack of acceptance, which is a form of judgment. True acceptance would mean being proud of him regardless of his appearance. The fact that she's concerned about her friends' judgment suggests that her own insecurities or societal pressures are influencing her, which isn't fair to her partner. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that she's in the wrong because her actions and words are causing emotional harm to her boyfriend under the guise of concern. The right approach would be to support him without shame and address any insecurities she has about their relationship dynamics.\n"
