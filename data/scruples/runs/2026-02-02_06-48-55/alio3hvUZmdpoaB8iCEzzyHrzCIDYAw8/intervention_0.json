My boyfriend is the sweetest guy (at least to me) and he always prioritize his well-being ahead of mine. Always picking my preferred food places, bringing me to places I feel like going and always keeping me entertained.\n\nI am in rather good shape and he's overweight. Personally, I am fine with his weight and the way he look, however, I try to avoid my friends seeing my boyfriend as I do not want to be judged. He is actually okay with the way he look but I have discussed this with him on several occasions and he starts to put in effort to lose weight by controlling his diet and exercising as and when he can. However, due to his busy schedule and habits, he is making slow or no progress. \n\nWhen we get into an argument, I will occasionally turn this into an argument point and he is quite affected by it and will instantly apologize. \n\nI love him and he is the nicest guy I have ever met. I am actually fine with how he look, just that I do not want my friends to see meet as I will feel ashamed. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeling ashamed of their boyfriend's weight. The situation is that the author is in a relationship with someone who's overweight, and while they personally accept their weight, they don't want their friends to meet the boyfriend because they feel ashamed. The boyfriend is trying to lose weight but struggling, and the author brings it up during arguments, causing him to apologize.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the author's feelings of shame and the impact on their partner. The author says they're okay with his weight but don't want friends to see him. That seems contradictory. Also, when arguments happen, they use his weight as a point, which affects him negatively.\n\nI need to consider if this is harmful. The boyfriend is making efforts, but the author's shame is affecting his self-esteem. Even if the author loves him, the behavior of using his weight in arguments and avoiding friends meeting him due to shame is problematic. It's about respecting his feelings and not contributing to negative self-image. The author might be projecting their own insecurities or societal pressures onto the relationship. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other without shame or judgment. The fact that the boyfriend is affected and apologizes shows that the dynamic is unhealthy. The author's actions, even if not malicious, contribute to the boyfriend feeling bad about himself. So, yeah, the author is likely in the wrong here. The answer is A.\n"
